  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect configurations made to the Run Once registry key on Windows systems, particularly those related to applications like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. These configurations can be executed via `runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup` to set user-specific settings or perform installations on startup. The rule focuses on specific registry modifications in the `\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components` path, observing events related to changes in the `StubPath` value. By analyzing Windows Registry events, especially those linked to the creation or modification of specific keys and values, the rule aims to identify potentially malicious or unauthorized configurations that might be used for persistence or other nefarious purposes. This detection ties into the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (Tactic: `T1112`).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Events**: Examine recent registry events for the `\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components` path to identify any unauthorized modifications.
  - **Correlate with EDR**: Use EDR tools to cross-reference the detected registry changes with process executions around the same time to identify the source of the change.
  - **Analyze Related Network Traffic**: Investigate network logs for connections made by executables involved in the registry modification to see if there's suspicious activity.
  - **Check for False Positives**: Validate the modification against known legitimate software installation processes to rule out false positives resulting from legitimate applications.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level as it may indicate a potential attempt to establish persistence via registry manipulation; however, it should be investigated in context to determine if it's a legitimate modification made by known software.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where legitimate applications modify the Run Once registry key without triggering the specific criteria outlined in the detection logic. Additionally, if the modification is performed using non-standard methods or tools that do not log events in the expected manner, the rule may fail to detect such changes. Furthermore, there is an assumption that relevant telemetry is being collected and that any third-party software configurations do not interfere with expected behavior.

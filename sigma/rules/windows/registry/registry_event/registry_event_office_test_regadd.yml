  ### Technical Context
  The "Office Application Startup 
  - Office Test" detection rule is aimed at identifying a specific registry modification in Windows that can facilitate malicious persistence techniques. This rule specifically looks for the addition of a registry entry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf`, which allows an attacker to specify a dynamic link library (DLL) that is executed every time an Office application is started. This technique aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence (T1137.002), which highlights methods used by adversaries to maintain their presence on a system. When the specified registry key is added, it indicates a potential compromise, likely intended to ensure that malicious code is executed whenever any Office application launches.
  The detection utilizes Windows registry event logs to monitor changes to critical registry paths associated with Microsoft Office applications. By observing these changes, security operations can identify unauthorized persistence mechanisms that may indicate an ongoing attack or compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Use the Windows Security logs to verify if the registry modification detected matches the described behavior and review the context around the change, including any user profiles involved.
  - **Review Process Creation:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate any recent process creations related to Microsoft Office applications, looking for unusual or unauthorized executables being run in conjunction with the registry modification.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Examine network connection logs from the NGFW and NDR tools to determine if any suspicious connections were made or if there were attempts to retrieve additional malicious payloads during the time frame of the registry change.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Check user activity logs to identify the last actions taken by the user account associated with the registry change, especially any recent credential usage or unauthorized access patterns in Office applications or related network services.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as medium severity because the detection of malicious persistence mechanisms can signify an active compromise, which may lead to more severe outcomes if not addressed promptly. The involvement of Office applications further escalates the urgency, given their widespread use in enterprises.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in cases where an adversary writes directly to the registry via methods that bypass typical logging mechanisms or uses legitimate administrative credentials to make changes. Additionally, environments where logging is not adequately configured or where users frequently modify registry settings for legitimate purposes could lead to false negatives. Assumptions include that the monitoring of registry events is comprehensive and that users do not have legitimate reasons for modifying the specific registry path in question.

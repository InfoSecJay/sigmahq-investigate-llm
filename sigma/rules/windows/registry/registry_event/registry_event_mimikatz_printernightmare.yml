  ### Technical Context
  The "PrinterNightmare Mimikatz Driver Name" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activities associated with the CVE-2021-1675 and CVE-2021-34527 vulnerabilities, which impact the Windows Print Spooler service. This rule focuses on certain registry keys that are indicative of the installation or usage of the Mimikatz tool, specifically targeting identifiers commonly used by the tool, such as "QMS 810" and various "mimikatz" strings. By monitoring Windows registry events, particularly for changes in the Print Spooler environment and printer drivers, the rule can alert SOC analysts to malicious attempts at credential dumping or exploitation within the environment. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for executing malicious code within applications, specifically under the "Execution" tactic and the relevant technique T1204 (User Execution).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Investigate alerts generated from endpoint detection and response solutions for any suspicious process executions associated with the detected Mimikatz-related driver name.
  - **Analyze Registry Changes**: Use Windows Event Logs to monitor and analyze recent registry changes at the identified paths, particularly focusing on suspicious entries alongside known legitimate driver installations.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs**: Check network logs for any unusual behavior or outbound connections that coincide with the timestamps of the registry changes, indicating potential data exfiltration.
  - **Examine Process Tree**: Utilize EDR tools to examine the process tree of any detected malicious activity to identify the parent process and any potential outbound connections initiated afterward.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the critical nature of the alert, organizations should treat this as a high-priority incident due to the potential for significant data breaches or system-wide compromises through the exploitation of the Print Spooler vulnerability.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where legitimate installations of the QMS 810 printer driver occur frequently, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if attackers use methods to obscure their activities or modify the registry keys subtly, such as employing alternate names or disguising known drivers, this rule may fail to fire. It is assumed that all devices in the environment are being adequately monitored and that endpoints are not overly protected by overly permissive security policies that could mask malicious activities.

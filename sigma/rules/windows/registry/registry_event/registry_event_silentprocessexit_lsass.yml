  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential credential dumping activities related to the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process via the SilentProcessExit technique, as defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Credential Access** (T1003.001). The rule works by monitoring changes to the Windows registry, specifically looking for entries that utilize the `SilentProcessExit` global flag associated with the LSASS process. When an adversary intends to dump memory from the LSASS process stealthily, they may register malicious programs that exploit this flag, thereby evading typical detection mechanisms. The involved technical data source is the Windows registry, particularly changes in the key `Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\lsass.exe`, which should trigger an alert if detected.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes**: Use a Windows Registry viewer or a command-line interface to inspect recent modifications in the `SilentProcessExit` registry key. Document any unusual values or recently added entries pertaining to LSASS.
    
  - **Analyze Process Creation Events**: Utilize EDR to review process creation logs around the time of the registry modification. Look for any process that has launched right after the registry change, especially if it invokes tools associated with credential dumping.
  - **Review Memory Dumps**: Check for memory dumps of lsass.exe within the environment. Use tools like Sysinternals Process Explorer or Volatility to search for any anomalies or unauthorized attempts to access or dump LSASS memory.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound connections from the hosts where the alerts were triggered. Look for connections initiating right before or after the registry change that could indicate data exfiltration of dumped credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as critical since successful credential dumping from LSASS can provide sensitive accounts' access credentials, potentially leading to a full compromise of the victimized system and further lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule operates under the assumption that the registry changes are not hindered by stringent permissions or security measures that would prevent unauthorized modifications. It may not fire if an adversary employs alternative methods for credential access that do not involve the registry, or if the modifications are removed or obfuscated quickly after being made, or if the LSASS process is not running. Additionally, alerts may go unnoticed if logging policies are insufficiently configured to capture all relevant registry modifications.

  ### Technical Context
  This rule is designed to detect modifications to the PortProxy registry keys within Windows systems, specifically targeting the entries linked to TCP port forwarding. The PortProxy functionality enables users to bypass network restrictions by allowing traffic on specific ports to be redirected to other IP addresses, which can be exploited by attackers for lateral movement, command-and-control operations, and evasion of network defenses. The rule analyzes registry event logs to identify any alterations made to the PortProxy settingsâ€”specifically, those that mention `\Services\PortProxy\v4tov4\tcp\`. By monitoring these events, SOC analysts can recognize potential unauthorized configurations that may indicate nefarious activity or the persistence mechanisms employed by attackers. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under Tactic: `Lateral Movement` and Technique: `T1090`.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Use the Windows Registry Viewer to review the specific changes made to the PortProxy registry keys. Identify the user and time of modification to determine if it aligns with acceptable administrative actions.
  - **Review System Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Security Event Logs for related login attempts or privilege escalation activities that may have occurred around the same time as the registry modification.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to examine network traffic directed through the modified port. Look for suspicious outbound connections that could indicate a possible compromise.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Tools:** Leverage Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to analyze any processes running on the host that may be related to the registry change, particularly those that invoke network communication.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity as unauthorized modifications to the PortProxy settings could signify an attempt to create a covert communication channel, thereby compromising the security posture of the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if users modify the PortProxy settings through legitimate means or if registry auditing is not enabled. Additionally, the detection may be circumvented by attackers using methods that do not involve direct registry modifications, such as using PowerShell scripts or legitimate administrative tools that do not trigger standard logging.

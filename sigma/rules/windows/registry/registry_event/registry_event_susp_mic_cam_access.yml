  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activity where processes are accessing the camera and microphone from suspicious directories, specifically within the Windows operating system. It focuses on registry events that indicate an application is attempting to access the consent settings for sensitive capabilities related to audio and video. The rule looks for processes accessing these features from locations like the Temp folder, Recycle Bin, and other public or default user directories, which are commonly associated with potentially untrusted or transient applications. This rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1125 (Video Capture) and T1123 (Audio Capture), highlighting the concern around unauthorized access to sensitive information via media capture.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Confirm the Process Origin:** Use EDR tools to review the process initiating the microphone or camera access. Check if the process is from a recognized application or contextually expected source.
    
  - **Assess the Registry Activity:** Query Windows Event Logs for registry modifications related to `CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore`. Investigate whether these changes correlate to unauthorized actions or processes.
  - **Evaluate User Context:** Cross-reference with user activity logs to determine if the action corresponds with legitimate user behavior or operations (e.g., video conferencing apps).
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Utilize NDR tools to look for abnormal network connections from the suspicious processes identified. This may reveal communications with external entities indicative of data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is assigned as high due to the potential privacy implications and security risks associated with unauthorized access to camera and microphone functionalities, which can lead to sensitive data capture and exploitation if exploited by adversaries.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate applications, such as conferencing tools, run from expected directories. Additionally, it operates under the assumption that malicious actors will use atypical directories for their processes. There is also the possibility that advanced adversaries could cover their tracks by modifying their process paths or managing permissions effectively, thus evading detection altogether.

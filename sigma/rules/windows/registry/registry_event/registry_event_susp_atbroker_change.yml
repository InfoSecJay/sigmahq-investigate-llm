  ### Technical Context
  The "Atbroker Registry Change" detection rule is designed to identify unauthorized alterations within the Windows Registry that are linked to Assistive Technology applications. Specifically, it focuses on registry changes in the paths related to accessibility settings, such as `Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs` and `Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\Configuration`. The detection logic is triggered when the `atbroker.exe` process interacts with these registry paths, indicating potential misuse for persistenceâ€”an aspect associated with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for persistence (T1547) and defense evasion (T1218). The primary telemetry utilized for this rule is Windows Registry event logs, which track modifications to the registry entries critical for monitoring unwanted software behavior.
  This rule specifically filters for entries that involve the `atbroker.exe` executable and distinguishes legitimate changes from potential threats by excluding changes initiated by uninstaller processes. Given that malicious actors may manipulate registry keys to establish persistence for their malware, understanding and monitoring these changes is crucial for maintaining security within an enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Registry Changes:** Review the Windows Registry event logs to identify the specific entries modified, focusing on the paths related to accessibility technologies.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Use the EDR tool to investigate the `atbroker.exe` process execution history and determine if there are any unusual command-line parameters or activity patterns that deviate from standard behavior.
  - **Check AV and EDR Alerts:** Cross-reference any related alerts from your antivirus and EDR solutions to see if they flagged suspicious activities linked to `atbroker.exe` or the alterations in accessibility settings.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Examine user account activity and associated action logs to establish whether the changes were authorized by legitimate users or represent potentially malicious actions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to its potential implications for system integrity and accessibility, which may indicate underlying malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence without user awareness.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot is the possibility of legitimate applications or users modifying the accessibility settings, which could lead to false positives. Additionally, the rule assumes that all relevant registry changes will be logged effectively; if logging configurations are missing or misconfigured, important events may not be captured. Adversaries may also try to evade this detection by using different executables or modifying registry entries in ways not covered by this rule, underscoring the need for a comprehensive monitoring strategy.

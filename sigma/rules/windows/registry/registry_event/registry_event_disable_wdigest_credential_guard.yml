title: Wdigest CredGuard Registry Modification
id: 1a2d6c47-75b0-45bd-b133-2c0be75349fd
status: test
description: |
  Detects potential malicious modification of the property value of IsCredGuardEnabled from
  HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest to disable Cred Guard on a system.
  This is usually used with UseLogonCredential to manipulate the caching credentials.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Wdigest CredGuard Registry Modification" is designed to detect unauthorized changes to the registry key responsible for enabling Windows Credential Guard (CredGuard). Located at `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest`, the specific property being monitored is `IsCredGuardEnabled`. A potential malicious actor could modify this setting to disable Credential Guard, which is often utilized in conjunction with `UseLogonCredential` to exploit credential caching vulnerabilities. The detection relies primarily on registry event logs, which capture any modifications made to registry values. This rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the technique T1112, which involves modifying security settings to evade detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Alert Context:** Use Windows Event Logs to identify when the modification occurred. Focus on timestamps and the user or process associated with the change to determine if it's authorized or suspicious.
    
  - **Review Recent Changes:** Query the registry for any recent changes to `IsCredGuardEnabled` and associated keys within the `WDigest` registry path. Cross-reference these changes with normal operational patterns for further analysis.
    
  - **Examine User Activity:** Investigate the user's activity around the time of change, particularly through EDR logs and User Access logs, to identify any potentially risky behaviors or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Check System Integrity:** Evaluate the overall system's integrity by checking other security-related registry keys and configurations, ensuring no further violations exist that could indicate a broader compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it signals a significant potential threat to endpoint security. Disabling Credential Guard could allow attackers to capture and misuse credentials, warranting immediate investigation to prevent further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry modification is achieved through native application calls that do not generate specific registry event logs or if the logs are insufficiently configured to monitor changes to this key. Additionally, the rule assumes that attackers would utilize a straightforward method for modification rather than sophisticated techniques like using legitimate processes to alter registry values silently. It may also miss changes made by privileged users or system-level processes unless adequate logging mechanisms are in place to capture these events.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of local hidden user accounts via registry activity on Windows systems. It looks for specific entries in the registry path `\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names\`, focusing on objects that end with a dollar sign (`$`), which are typically associated with hidden accounts. The rule monitors activity from the `lsass.exe` process (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service), a critical component responsible for security policy enforcement, user authentication, and password changes. The detection leverages Windows Sysmon's registry event logging (specifically targeting registry modifications), which is invaluable for tracking unauthorized changes that might indicate malicious persistence tactics. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's tactic of 'Persistence' and technique 'Create Account' (T1136.001), as adversaries may use these hidden accounts to maintain access to compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs:** Review Sysmon registry event logs for entries related to the suspicious creation of user accounts under the specified path. Pay attention to entries that match the defined criteria in the rule.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Utilize your EDR tool to investigate the process activity of `lsass.exe` during the timeframe of the event to ascertain if it was involved in any suspicious behavior or anomalies.
  - **Analyze User Account List:** Use Windows management tools (e.g., `net user` command) or Group Policy Management to enumerate user accounts on the affected systems and confirm the existence of any unauthorized accounts.
  - **Review Audit Logs:** Examine Windows Security logs to look for any authentication events or login attempts associated with the newly created hidden user account, especially pertaining to failed logins that may indicate a brute-force attempt.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level assigned to this alert, it is crucial to prioritize investigations immediately as the creation of hidden user accounts may indicate an active compromise, enabling an adversary's persistence and further exploitation within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if logging is not properly configured for Sysmon or if the adversaries employ techniques to obfuscate their actions, such as modifying legitimate tools or using alternate methods for user account creation. Moreover, false positives can arise from legitimate administrative actions or third-party software that creates hidden accounts. It's important for detection engineers to understand the context of usage and confirm that appropriate telemetry is in place.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potential attempts to disable security event logging in a Windows environment by monitoring modifications to the system registry. Specifically, it detects when a key named 'MiniNt' is added to the registry path `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\`. This addition indicates a tactic that adversaries may use to prevent the Windows Event Log service from creating new logs, which is pertinent to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1562.001 (Disable or Modify Tools) and T1112 (Modify Registry). The primary data sources used in this rule include Windows Registry Event logs, which provide insights into changes made to registry keys including the creation of keys and their corresponding attributes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Change:** Check the registry path `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\` for the presence of the 'MiniNt' key by using a registry editor or EDR tool to confirm the rule's trigger.
  - **Review Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs, particularly the Security and System logs, for any suspicious activity surrounding the time of the detected `CreateKey` event, which could suggest malicious intent.
  - **Analyze Recent Activity:** Use the EDR solution to evaluate recent process and user activity that may have led to the modification of the registry, identifying any anomalous behavior potentially linked to this action.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Check other security alerts from proxies, firewalls, or AV logs for suspicious actions that may correlate with the creation of the 'MiniNt' key to paint a broader picture of the environment during the incident.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the severity of disabling security event logging, this alert is classified as high priority. The ability to prevent log creation directly impacts an organizationâ€™s ability to detect and respond to suspicious activities, making this a critical indicator of potential compromise.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the endpoint has Sysmon installed and is configured to capture registry events, which may not be the case in all environments. It may not fire if an adversary uses methods other than registry modifications (e.g., leveraging built-in tools or scripting) to achieve similar results. Additionally, the absence of proper logging or monitoring on endpoints may lead to undetected changes.

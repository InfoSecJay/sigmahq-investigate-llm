  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify the creation of specific registry entries associated with the Azorult malware, a known information-stealing trojan. The rule monitors for Windows registry events, particularly those with Event IDs 12 and 13, which indicate that an entry has been created or modified. It specifically looks for entries targeting the `SYSTEM\services\localNETService` key, which is typically used during the execution of Azorult to establish persistence on infected systems. By leveraging Windows registry logs, this rule helps pinpoint the presence of potentially malicious activity indicative of the trojan's behavior. This activity is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (T1112 
  - Modify Registry).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query Registry Logs:** Use your SIEM to search for recent registry events associated with `SYSTEM\services\localNETService` and check for Event IDs 12 and 13. Focus on timestamps around the alert time for context.
    
  - **Analyze Associated Processes:** Utilize EDR tools to examine any processes that may have been created or launched around the same time as the registry modification. Look for indications of the Azorult trojan or other anomalous processes.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Investigate any unusual outbound network connections using NDR or firewall logs. Focus on connections established by processes identified in the previous step. 
  - **Assess File System Activity:** Check file creation and modification logs through EDR or Sysmon events to find any files that might have been created or altered alongside the registry entries related to Azorult.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as critical due to the malicious intent of the Azorult malware, which focuses on data exfiltration. Prompt attention is warranted to mitigate potential data breaches within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the telemetry will effectively capture all registry changes; however, it may not fire if the malware employs advanced techniques to evade detection, such as using obfuscated or ephemeral registry keys. Additionally, if the detection infrastructure is not properly configured to capture registry events comprehensively, some instances of the malware's activity may go unnoticed.

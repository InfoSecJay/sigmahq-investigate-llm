  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect unauthorized installation of the Azure Hybrid Connection Manager service on Windows systems, a potential indicator of remote code execution capability from Azure functions. The detection mechanism relies on monitoring Windows Registry events, specifically focusing on the creation or modification of registry keys related to the Hybrid Connection Manager service. The rule looks for two primary indicators: the registry path containing `\Services\HybridConnectionManager` and the presence of the executable `Microsoft.HybridConnectionManager.Listener.exe` in registry entries. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Resource Development (T1608), wherein adversaries may establish persistence or remote access through services installed on an endpoint.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes**: Use registry monitoring tools to identify when the Hybrid Connection Manager service was installed. Search for the creation or modification of `\Services\HybridConnectionManager` and correlate timestamps with other system events.
    
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Investigate EDR logs for alerts associated with the `Microsoft.HybridConnectionManager.Listener.exe` executable. Look for any unusual behavior patterns linked to this process, including any attempted connections or lateral movement.
  - **Analyze System Logs**: Examine Windows Security, System, and Application logs for related events surrounding the time of the installation. Pay particular attention to events showing process creation and execution requests.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Utilize NDR tools to assess network traffic to and from the target machine. Look for any unusual outbound connections or traffic patterns that corresponding with the installation of the Hybrid Connection Manager.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of high indicates that the installation of the Azure Hybrid Connection Manager service may signify a serious security risk, as it could allow an adversary to remotely execute code, potentially compromising sensitive data and systems within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the installation of the service is performed through legitimate means or by authorized personnel, such as during a scheduled update or configuration. Additionally, if the target system lacks adequate logging or if registry auditing is not enabled, potential abuses may go undetected. Furthermore, sophisticated attackers might evade detection by modifying their approach or using alternative executable paths not monitored by this rule.

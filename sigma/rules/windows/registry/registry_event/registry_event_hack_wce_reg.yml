  ### Technical Context
  The "Windows Credential Editor Registry" detection rule identifies potential misuse of the Windows Credential Editor (WCE), a tool often leveraged by adversaries to extract and manipulate Windows credentials. The rule specifically monitors registry events for any changes indicating the service start configuration associated with WCE (i.e., the registry path `Services\WCESERVICE\Start`). When the WCE service is initiated, it can signify an attempt to duplicate or harvest sensitive authentication data. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the **Credential Access** tactic and specifically the **Credential Dumping** technique (T1003.001), which encompasses methods adversaries use to acquire account credentials from various systems.
  The rule relies on monitoring the Windows Registry, capturing events related to configuration changes that may indicate malicious intent. Key data sources include Windows Security logs specifically associated with registry actions, making it essential for incident responders to have visibility into these logs to effectively investigate triggering alerts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate Triggering Events:** Review the registry event logs for entries related to `Services\WCESERVICE\Start` to analyze the timing and context of the changes associated with WCE activities.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Utilize your EDR solution to correlate registry modifications with process creation events that occurred around the same time, specifically any instances of `wce.exe` or other suspicious binaries launching.
  - **Evaluate Network Activity:** Analyze outbound network connections made by the system during or shortly after the registry events to identify any suspicious beaconing or credential exfiltration attempts.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Check the user activity logs and authentication events within Windows Security logs to ensure that no unauthorized account activity coincides with the WCE service interaction.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the criticality of potential exposure to sensitive credentials, alerts fired by this rule should be prioritized as high severity. The presence of the WCE service being initiated can indicate compromised systems, warranting prompt investigation and response.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection may not fire if the attacker executes the WCE tool directly without modifying the registry or if they use other credential dumping techniques that do not involve changes to the specified registry path. Additionally, environments lacking comprehensive logging configurations for registry events might miss critical indicators of WCE usage. It is assumed that all essential registry event logging is enabled and that attackers may employ persistence techniques that do not trigger this specific detection.

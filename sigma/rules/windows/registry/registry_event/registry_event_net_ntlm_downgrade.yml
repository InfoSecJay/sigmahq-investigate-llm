  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential NetNTLM downgrade attacks by monitoring specific changes in Windows registry settings associated with local security authority configurations. Specifically, it looks for modifications to the registry keys under `SYSTEM\ControlSet\Control\Lsa`, such as `lmcompatibilitylevel`, `NtlmMinClientSec`, and `RestrictSendingNTLMTraffic`. The successful execution of a NetNTLM downgrade attack often involves reducing the security level of NTLM authentication, and the detection rule leverages the Windows registry event logs to catch these modifications in real-time. The technique aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1562.001) and Credential Access (T1112).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes**: Use the Windows Security Event Logs to trace the specific changes made to the relevant registry keys and values. This helps confirm whether a downgrade attack has been initiated.
  - **Analyze User Accounts**: Investigate user accounts and authentication logs for any suspicious login attempts or failed logins that coincide with the noted registry changes using EDR solutions.
  - **Review Proxy Logs**: Examine proxy logs for abnormal authentication patterns or unexpected network traffic that may indicate active exploitation attempts linked to the registry changes.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts**: Use EDR tools to assess if any alerts related to credential theft or unusual authentication behaviors were triggered around the same time the registry modifications were logged to establish a timeline of events.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is classified as high due to the critical nature of NTLM authentication in maintaining secure access across enterprise systems. A successful downgrade can lead to significant security breaches, making it imperative to investigate promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments that restrict direct registry modifications through well-configured policies. Additionally, legitimate services and tools that alter the specified values for permissible operations could generate false positives. Assume that an adversary may employ techniques to obfuscate or mask their activity, such as changing values back after exploitation, limiting the ruleâ€™s effectiveness in those scenarios.

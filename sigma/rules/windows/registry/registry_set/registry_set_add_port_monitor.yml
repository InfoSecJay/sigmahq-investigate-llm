title: Add Port Monitor Persistence in Registry
id: 944e8941-f6f6-4ee8-ac05-1c224e923c0e
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may use port monitors to run an attacker supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation.
  A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Add Port Monitor Persistence in Registry" aims to identify attempts by adversaries to achieve persistence on Windows systems through the registration of port monitors. The rule specifically looks for registry changes that add DLLs in the `\Control\Print\Monitors\` registry path, particularly those that are meant to be executed at system startup. These DLLs may be used for executing malicious code or facilitating privilege escalation. The key data sources involved in this detection include Windows Registry logs that can reveal changes made to port monitor configuration, as well as potential linking to DLL files that are loaded during system boot. This detection corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: **Persistence** and Technique: **T1547.010** (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review alerts in your EDR solution related to process creation events for spoolsv.exe around the time the registry changes occurred, ensuring that these do not correspond to legitimate port monitor installations.
  - **Examine Registry Changes:** Use registry monitoring tools or `reg.exe` to query the `\Control\Print\Monitors\` path and look for any unauthorized modifications or unusual DLL entries.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Investigate the behavior of the detected DLL file through process monitoring tools or security logs that may show signs of exploitation, such as unexpected network connections or file modifications.
  - **Consult AV and Threat Intelligence:** Search your AV logs and any threat intelligence feeds for information related to the identified DLL or port monitor names to see if they have any known malware associations.
  ### Prioritization
  These alerts should be prioritized as medium severity because registry modifications for persistence are often indicative of an ongoing attack or premeditated plan by an adversary, requiring prompt investigation to prevent potential escalation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary uses alternative persistence mechanisms that do not involve registry modifications, or if the attack is directed at non-privileged accounts that do not have permission to alter registry keys. Additionally, some legitimate software might also trigger the detection if it registers a port monitor, leading to false positives. Analysts should be prepared for instances where an attacker might obfuscate their actions or manipulate the API to avoid detection through typical telemetry.

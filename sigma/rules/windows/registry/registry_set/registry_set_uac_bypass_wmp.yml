  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) using a known method that involves the Windows Media Player's `osksupport.dll`. Specifically, it monitors registry modifications that are indicative of this technique, particularly targeting a specific registry path related to Application Compatibility Flags. The rule focuses on changes to the registry key that manages compatibility settings for applications, which when manipulated, can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This behavior is consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for privilege escalation (T1548.002: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism), as both the UAC bypass and the modification of the registry are tactics used by malicious actors to escalate privileges and evade detection.
  The rule leverages Windows Registry logs (specifically `registry_set` events) as its primary data source to identify these suspicious modifications. Responders are encouraged to investigate the context of the detected registry changes as they may indicate potential malicious activity attempting to exploit this UAC bypass technique.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Access the Windows Registry on the monitored endpoint and navigate to the specified key (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store\`). Check for any recent modifications to the `osk.exe` entries.
    
  - **Cross-reference Event Logs:** Review the Security event logs for any corresponding logon events or privilege escalation attempts that coincide with the timestamp of the registry changes. Look for abnormal behavior or patterns.
  - **Examine Process Execution:** Utilize EDR solutions to analyze process creation logs around the time of the registry modification. Look for the execution of `osk.exe` or other suspicious processes that might indicate an illicit escalation of privileges.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network connection logs for any unexpected communication that may have occurred post-registry modification. Pay particular attention to connections that may appear to interact with command and control (C2) servers.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been prioritized as high severity due to the potential implications of a successful UAC bypass, which can enable an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system, allowing for further compromise and manipulation of sensitive resources.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are a few considerations regarding potential blind spots with this rule. It may not fire if the modification is made through alternative means (e.g., non-privileged accounts or methods that do not access the registry directly). Furthermore, legitimate applications that alter the same registry settings may create false positives. Additionally, if the offensive technique is executed with tools or scripts that obfuscate the registry changes, the detection may be evaded. Lastly, responses might fail if the SIEM lacks comprehensive logging of registry modifications or if there are limitations on the visibility of user actions.

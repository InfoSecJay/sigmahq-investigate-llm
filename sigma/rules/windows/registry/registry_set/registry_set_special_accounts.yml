  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on monitoring changes made to the Windows registry key `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist`, particularly targeting modifications where the value is set to `0`. When this change occurs, it effectively hides the specified user account from being displayed on the Windows logon screen. This technique is often employed by attackers to obfuscate their activities and evade detection, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of defense evasion under technique T1564.002. By detecting such alterations, the rule aims to identify potential malicious actions that strive to conceal user accounts, which could indicate a compromised system or unauthorized access attempts.
  The key telemetry monitoring for this rule is derived from Windows registry logs, specifically focusing on `SetValue` event types that indicate registry modifications. Investigators need to pay attention to which user accounts are being hidden and analyze the context surrounding these changes to discern legitimate administrative actions from malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Confirm Registry Change:** Utilize Windows Event Logs and a registry auditing tool to confirm the modification to the `UserList` key and retrieve details about which account was hidden and when the change was made. 
  - **Check User Account Activity:** Cross-reference the modified account with logs from EDR and Security logs to investigate recent user activity, focusing on logon attempts and behaviors leading up to the registry modification.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Leverage SIEM and EDR tools to identify any other related alerts or suspicious activities that coincide with the registry change, such as unexpected processes or unusual network connections.
  - **Engage in Threat Hunting:** Conduct broader threat-hunting activities within the environment, checking for other instances of similar registry modifications, network behaviors, or file changes that may indicate ongoing malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to its potential implication of active orchestration by an adversary attempting to hide their presence on a system. Hiding user accounts is a common technique used in persistence and stealth, often signaling an escalating threat level that requires immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry changes are executed in a manner that does not utilize `SetValue`, such as through direct API calls or if attackers employ sophisticated methods to obfuscate these actions. Additionally, legitimate administrative changes to user visibility may inadvertently trigger false positives if not accompanied by additional malicious indicators. Analysts should also consider that modifications to the registry may be performed under privileged accounts, masking their origins.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup" is designed to monitor registry modifications that disable administrative shares on Windows systems. Administrative shares such as `C$` and `D$` allow system administrators to remotely access disk volumes, which can be subjected to abuse by attackers for lateral movement and data exfiltration. This rule specifically looks for changes to the `AutoShareWks` and `AutoShareServer` registry keys under the `\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\` path, which control the automatic creation of these shares. By monitoring events related to these registry updates, the rule helps in identifying potential attempts to disable administrative shares as part of an evasive maneuver. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1070.005 (Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Registry Changes:** Use Windows Registry logs to review changes to the `\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\` path and confirm if the `AutoShareWks` and `AutoShareServer` keys are set to `0`.
  - **Cross-Reference EDR Data:** Analyze endpoint detection and response (EDR) data to identify any process that triggered the registry change, paying attention to the source process and associated command-line parameters.
  - **Review Account Activity:** Investigate logs for user or service accounts that modified the registry to determine if the change was made by legitimate administrative activities or unauthorized access.
  - **Check for Other Malicious Indicators:** Utilize security solutions such as AV and NDR to assess if there are any concurrent alerts or activity indicative of a broader attack, such as unusual network traffic or unauthorized remote access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because the disabling of administrative shares can indicate a potential prelude to more serious malicious activities, such as lateral movement within the network or data theft, especially if combined with other suspicious actions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if registry changes are performed quickly or through legitimate administrative tools that do not generate standard event logs. Additionally, if the attacker uses advanced techniques to manipulate the registry without leaving a trace or uses a trusted process to execute the change, the rule may be evaded. It assumes that auditing for the registry is enabled and effective in the environment.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying changes to the "HVCIDisallowedImages" registry value within Windows systems, which may indicate an attempt to block a driver from loading during the secure boot process managed by Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI). The key aspect of this detection is monitoring registry modifications, specifically looking for entries that include the path `\Control\CI\` and the registry value `\HVCIDisallowedImages`. Such modifications are often leveraged by adversaries attempting to introduce malicious drivers while circumventing OS security measures, making them relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Defense Evasion (T1561). By scrutinizing these registry changes, we can reveal potential attempts to undermine system integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Change Context**: Use Windows registry viewers or PowerShell to inspect the specific change made to the "HVCIDisallowedImages" value and identify the driver associated with it.
  - **Assess Driver Validity**: Leverage EDR solutions to check the reputation and behavior of the newly added driver. Determine if it is legitimate or flagged for suspicious activities.
  - **Examine Related Activity**: Review system and application event logs around the time of the registry modification for any correlated anomalous behavior or other alerts.
  - **Check for Further Indicators**: Query network connections, process creations, or other telemetry sources to uncover related activities that could signify an attempt to exploit the change or establish persistence.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because unauthorized changes to security-critical registry values can impair system defenses, allowing malicious software to operate at a low level. Immediate investigation is crucial to mitigate potential risks to system integrity and protection mechanisms.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary employs legitimate means to change the registry setting or if the systemâ€™s registry change logging is disabled. Additionally, an attacker could utilize tactics such as code signing for malicious drivers, potentially leading to false negatives. Assumptions include that the investigation will not capture transient or remote attacks which manipulate the registry before reverting changes or that legitimate software operations could falsely trigger this rule.

  Detects when an attacker tries to disable User Account Control (UAC) notification by tampering with the "UACDisableNotify" value.
  UAC is a critical security feature in Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to the operating system. It prompts the user for permission or an administrator password before allowing actions that could affect the system's operation or change settings that affect other users.
  When "UACDisableNotify" is set to 1, UAC prompts are suppressed.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies attempts to disable User Account Control (UAC) notifications by monitoring changes to the Windows registry, specifically targeting the `UACDisableNotify` value. UAC serves as a critical security layer in Windows operating systems, designed to prevent unauthorized modifications to system settings. When the `UACDisableNotify` registry value is modified to 1 (DWORD), it effectively suppresses UAC prompts, enabling potential attackers to perform actions with elevated privileges without user consent or awareness. The rule utilizes the registry_set log source, capturing modifications in real-time, making it a key indicator of privilege escalation or defense evasion activities according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of Privilege Escalation (T1548.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Change History:** Use a registry monitoring tool or process logs to confirm the timestamp and source of the change to the `UACDisableNotify` value, looking for any suspicious user actions preceding the modification.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate any processes created shortly before or after the registry modification using EDR tools, focusing on processes that typically require elevated permissions.
  - **Examine User Account Actions:** Using Windows Security logs, review user account activities and authentication events around the time of the UAC setting change to understand user behavior and potential misuses of privileged accounts.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference the identified modification with known adversary techniques and tactics disclosed in threat intelligence feeds to evaluate if the activity aligns with recognized malicious behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed medium severity in an enterprise environment due to the potential for unauthorized changes to system security settings, which could enable broader exploitation opportunities, including privilege escalation and evasion techniques.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire if the registry change is made using methods that do not generate standard logs or if the monitoring tools are misconfigured. Additionally, adversaries might employ stealth tactics to alter the registry without triggering typical logging mechanisms. It is also important to note that changes could occur due to legitimate administrative activities, leading to potential false positives, thus careful contextual investigation is essential.

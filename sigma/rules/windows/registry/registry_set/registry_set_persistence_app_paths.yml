title: Potential Persistence Via App Paths Default Property
id: 707e097c-e20f-4f67-8807-1f72ff4500d6
status: test
description: |
  Detects changes to the "Default" property for keys located in the \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\ registry. Which might be used as a method of persistence
  The entries found under App Paths are used primarily for the following purposes.
  First, to map an application's executable file name to that file's fully qualified path.
  Second, to prepend information to the PATH environment variable on a per-application, per-process basis.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies potential persistence mechanisms employed by adversaries through modifications made to the "Default" property of registry keys located in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\`. This registry path is generally used to associate executable filenames with their full paths, as well as to affect the PATH environment variable for specific applications. By monitoring changes to this registry location, the rule can detect unauthorized or suspicious modifications that might be indicative of an attacker attempting to maintain persistence on the system.
  The technical sources utilized for this detection include Windows Registry logs that track changes made to registry keys. Specifically, the rule looks for alterations to keys with a "Default" property or "Path" in environments where potentially malicious binaries are registered from sensitive or unusual directories, such as `\AppData`, `\Temp`, `\Desktop`, and common script interpreters (e.g., PowerShell). This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1546.012 (Windows Event Logs: Event ID 4616), focused on unauthorized changes for persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use tools like Windows Registry Editor or PowerShell to examine the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\` for unauthorized modifications and confirm the legitimacy of any suspicious entries.
  - **Check Process Activity:** Utilize EDR solutions to track any executed processes associated with the suspicious registry entries. Look for anomalies in process behavior, such as unusual command-line arguments.
  - **Analyze Event Logs:** Review Windows Security and System logs to identify any related security events or alterations leading up to the registry change. This can provide context on user activity and potential exploitation.
  - **Conduct File Analysis:** Investigate the files referenced in the suspicious registry paths using antivirus and EDR tools. Determine if they are known malware or legitimate applications that could be misused for persistence.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is categorized as high due to the potential for persistent threats that can compromise critical systems or data. If adversaries successfully establish persistence via these registry modifications, it could lead to unauthorized access and further lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may fail to report if an adversary uses stealth techniques to modify registry keys without standard log generation or if they target less common application paths not included in the specified detection criteria. Additionally, legitimate applications may lead to false positives if they register themselves under the monitored paths; therefore, analysts should consider their context and previous usage patterns. It is also assumed that Sysmon or similar telemetry tools are configured correctly to log registry modifications.

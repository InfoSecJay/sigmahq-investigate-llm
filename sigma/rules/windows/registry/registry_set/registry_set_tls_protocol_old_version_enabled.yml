  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects instances where old TLS versions (TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1) are being re-enabled in a Windows environment. Specifically, it looks for changes to the Windows Registry settings under the Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols path. When an application or user modifies the "Enabled" value of the relevant protocols to "1" (DWORD), this indicates that older TLS versions are being authorized for use again, which can put the organization at higher risk for vulnerabilities and exploits that these outdated protocols are susceptible to. The rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique of defense evasion, as adversaries may weaken security controls by enabling these deprecated protocols for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Use a tool such as Sysinternals' Autoruns or PowerShell to inspect the Registry paths to determine when and who made the modification to the TLS protocol settings. This will help identify if the change was intended or a potential security risk.
  - **Review Application Logs:** Examine relevant application and system logs (via Windows Event Viewer or SIEM) to confirm the context of the changes, particularly focusing on events around the time the modification was made.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Investigate the user accounts that made changes to the TLS settings by utilizing Windows Security logs and EDR tools to assess their activity patterns for any signs of unusual or unauthorized behavior.
  - **Evaluate Network Traffic:** Inspect network traffic logs (such as those available from a Network Detection and Response tool) to find any sessions utilizing the older TLS versions to determine if sensitive data is being compromised.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential risks associated with re-enabling outdated TLS protocols, alerts from this rule should be treated with medium severity. Organizations prioritize these alerts to mitigate the risk of exploitation due to vulnerabilities associated with older TLS versions.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the changes to the TLS protocol settings are made via alternative methods or if the registry keys are modified using alternative names or APIs that bypass typical monitoring. It also assumes that detection mechanisms are in place and fully operational. Additionally, legitimate business reasons may need to be consulted for why such settings were altered, signaling a need for further investigation into known compatibility issues.

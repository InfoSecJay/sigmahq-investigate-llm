  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Potential Attachment Manager Settings Attachments Tamper" is designed to detect unauthorized changes to critical Windows Attachment Manager settings in Registry. This rule monitors specific registry keys, particularly under `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments`, which control the handling of downloaded files and attachments. The detection looks for changes to values that may indicate tampering, such as setting the `HideZoneInfoOnProperties` value to `1` (which hides security zone information in file properties), turning off `SaveZoneInformation` (which saves zone information about files), and disabling `ScanWithAntiVirus` (which prevents files from being scanned for malware). The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic for this detection falls under Defense Evasion (T1203), highlighting its relevance in identifying behavior that seeks to circumvent established security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Utilize a Windows Registry monitoring tool or EDR to examine the specific registry paths under `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments` for any unauthorized edits or newly created keys.
  - **Check Recent Process Activity:** Analyze process creation logs via Sysmon or EDR to identify processes that may have manipulated the registry settings, particularly looking for any suspicious entries that correlate with the timestamps of registry changes.
  - **Evaluate Endpoint Security Alerts:** Review AV logs for any alerts or blocks that occurred around the time of the registry changes; a lack of detections despite registry tampering may indicate a security failure.
  - **Inspect User Activity Logs:** Cross-reference user access logs and accounts that made changes to these settings, checking for unusual user behavior or administrative access rights that may lead to security violations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of compromising Attachment Manager settings, which could allow malware to bypass security defenses, increasing the risk of malware infections across the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the tampering occurs through means that do not directly manipulate the registry, such as malicious software that modifies behaviors without writing to the specified paths. Additionally, legitimate administrative changes by authorized personnel may generate false positives if not cross-validated with user activity. It is important to consider the environment's specific configurations, as default settings may vary across different Windows versions or configurations.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Change Winevt Channel Access Permission Via Registry" focuses on detecting potentially malicious tampering with the Windows Event Log Channel Access permissions through registry modifications. This activity typically involves changing access permissions in the registry key located at `\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\ChannelAccess`, which could allow unauthorized users or processes to bypass logging and monitoring mechanisms. The detection uses the registry_set log source and looks for specific conditions in the TargetObject field indicating changes to the ChannelAccess permissions, including patterns that provide excessive rights to local administrators, the Local System, or Built-in Administrators. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique TA0005 (Defense Evasion), specifically tactic T1562.002 which focuses on permissions at the logging level.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs for Changes:** Review Windows Security Event Logs to identify any recent access or modification events correlated with the event channelâ€™s registry changes.
  - **Monitor EDR Alerts:** Utilize the endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to trace back the actions leading to the modification of the ChannelAccess permissions and any associated process behaviors.
  - **Validate Registry State:** Manually inspect the registry paths associated with Event Log Channel Access to verify the current permissions and ensure no unauthorized changes were made.
  - **Review Application Logs:** Check logs from applications and services that depend on Windows Event Logs to identify any disruptions or anomalies following the detected permission changes.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert signifies a high severity level because unauthorized modifications to event log permissions pose significant risks to the integrity of logging systems, allowing attackers to obscure their tracks during intrusions, which can lead to undetected malicious activities in the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where an attacker utilizes stealth techniques that do not trigger a registry modification or when the registry change is executed by a trusted process like TrustedInstaller or TiWorker, which the rule specifically filters out. Additionally, internal changes made by legitimate administrators may not be captured, leading to potential false negatives. It is also assumed that the relevant logging levels are appropriately set to capture such registry access events, and any disabled logging may result in missed detections.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect the installation of a DNS Server Level Plugin DLL by monitoring changes made to the Windows Registry, specifically looking for modifications to the `ServerLevelPluginDll` parameter located under the `\services\DNS\Parameters` path. This parameter is integral to extending the functionality of the DNS server, and its manipulation can potentially enable malicious entities to execute arbitrary code within the DNS server context. Such behavior is tied to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1574.002 (DLL Search Order Hijacking) which illustrates methods adversaries use to execute malicious payloads while evading defensive mechanisms by leveraging legitimate processes. The primary data source for this detection is Windows Registry logs, making it essential that organizations monitor these changes closely to prevent and respond to possible DNS-related attacks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Review the Windows Registry for changes to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\ServerLevelPluginDll` to identify any recent installations or modifications that occurred around the time of the alert.
  - **Examine System Logs:** Utilize Windows Security, System, and Application logs from the event viewer to correlate timestamps and address any suspicious activities or services that may correlate with the DNS service after the change was detected.
  - **Verify DNS Service Behavior:** Confirm the operational behavior of the DNS server by assessing running services and any unusual requests or behaviors in the DNS queries that could indicate exploitation post DLL installation.
  - **Utilize EDR Tools:** Leverage EDR tools to perform a deep dive into processes running on the system. Focus on the DNS service processes and any related processes that have utilized the loaded DLL and ascertain their integrity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential impact of unauthorized code execution within critical network infrastructure, this alert is prioritized as high. Any installations of unexpected DLLs within the DNS service should prompt immediate investigation due to the potential for significant operational disruption or data exfiltration.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the adversary uses alternative methods to modify or install DLLs in a less detectable manner, such as utilizing different registry paths or employing custom methods to hide their activity. Additionally, there may be legitimate applications or maintenance tasks that result in changes to the `ServerLevelPluginDll`, potentially resulting in false positives. Engineers should also consider that the presence of security controls like application whitelisting or robust endpoint protection could impact the effectiveness of this detection.

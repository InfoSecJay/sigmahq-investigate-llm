title: Default RDP Port Changed to Non Standard Port

  Detects changes to the default RDP port.
  Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into a remote system using an interactive session with a graphical user interface.
  Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies when the default port for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been changed from its standard value of 3389 to a non-standard port. RDP is a common access tool used for remote management of Windows systems, and the modification of its listening port is often a tactic employed by attackers aiming to obscure unauthorized access attempts. The rule leverages Windows Registry change logs specifically targeting the registry key associated with the RDP service, found under `\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp\PortNumber`. By monitoring changes to this key, organizations can detect potentially malicious alterations that could indicate a move to enhance the stealth of remote access by unauthorized users. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence and specifically targets the technique T1547.010 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Change**: Use tools that can query the Windows Registry, such as Sysinternals' Regedit or PowerShell, to confirm the new port number for RDP and to find out when the change occurred.
  - **Correlate Event Logs**: Review Windows Security or System logs surrounding the time of the registry change to look for suspicious logins or failed RDP connection attempts.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic**: Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to analyze traffic on the new RDP port to identify any unauthorized or unusual access patterns from external sources.
  - **Check User Accounts**: Review local and domain user accounts using Active Directory logs and EDR solutions to determine if any unauthorized accounts or privilege escalations coincide with the registry modification.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity because changing the default RDP port may indicate an attempt to obfuscate unauthorized access to sensitive systems, warranting immediate investigation to prevent potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule assumes that the system's registry is being monitored consistently and that any approved changes to the RDP port are logged with sufficient detail. However, this rule may not fire if an adversary utilizes methods to bypass registry logging or if there are legitimate IT operational changes conducted without proper documentation. Additionally, there might be a delay in the logging of registry changes, which could hinder real-time detection.

  Detects changes in Sysmon driver altitude value.
  If the Sysmon driver is configured to load at an altitude of another registered service, it will fail to load at boot.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule, titled "Sysmon Driver Altitude Change," focuses on monitoring changes made to the altitude value of the Sysmon driver within the Windows registry. Specifically, it observes modifications to registry keys that indicate the altitude settings for services associated with Sysmon, which are critical for its proper functionality. An alteration in the altitude value can signify an attempt by an adversary to manipulate Sysmon behavior, such as preventing it from loading or running concurrently with other system services. The main data source utilized for this rule is registry set logs, which log changes made to the registry, a vital component for tracking system configuration and security settings. This detection ties into the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, particularly technique T1562.001, which highlights the adversary's efforts to evade detection mechanisms.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) alerts for any suspicious process creations or registry modifications that could correlate with the Sysmon driver altitude change.
  - **Analyze Registry Changes:** Utilize tools to query the specific registry path `\Services\` and examine recent changes pertaining to the altitude settings for the Sysmon driver.
  - **Confirm Legitimate Activity:** Verify if the change in altitude was a legitimate action by checking application logs or change management records to distinguish between benign and malicious modifications.
  - **Cross-reference with Security Logs:** Investigate Windows Security logs and Sysmon logs to determine if there are concurrent suspicious activities or anomalies in process execution that could indicate adversarial behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is given a high severity rating because an unauthorized change to Sysmon's altitude value can indicate a deliberate attempt to disable or bypass this monitoring tool, significantly undermining the organization's detection and response capabilities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule may be hindered in environments where registry modifications are frequently authorized or legitimate, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an adversary uses advanced methods to modify the Sysmon configuration without triggering registry logging, this rule might not fire. Furthermore, the assumption here is that all relevant registry access activities are being monitored; should any logging be disabled or misconfigured, chances of detection might decrease.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential persistence mechanisms utilizing Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) add-ins within Microsoft Office applications such as Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The rule monitor and analyzes registry modifications, specifically looking for entries under specific paths that indicate the installation of add-ins. By focusing on the `TargetObject` containing keys associated with Office add-ins and filtering out benign installations initiated by standard processes like `msiexec.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, and Office application executables, the rule aims to identify potentially malicious persistence techniques used by threat actors.
  Persistence tactics, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, can involve manipulating legitimate software functionalities to remain undetected while executing malicious actions. In this case, the rule correlates with the ATT&CK technique T1137.006 (Office Add-in), indicating a methodical approach to leveraging Office applications for continuous access to a victim's environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Modifications:** Use tools like Regedit or Sysinternals Process Explorer to examine recent changes to the registry paths specified in the alert, ensuring they do not correspond to legitimate add-in installations.
  - **Analyze Affected Processes:** Utilize Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to trace the activity of processes identified in the alert (e.g., `excel.exe`, `winword.exe`) and look for abnormal behavior or anomalous command-line arguments.
  - **Check for Survivor Patterns:** Investigate correlated network traffic or file modifications that may indicate threats are communicating or persisting beyond the initial registry insertion by examining logs from firewalls, proxies, or EDR.
  - **Consult with Teams:** Reach out to internal teams (e.g., IT, application development) to validate legitimate usage or planned installation of VSTO add-ins that could explain the registry modifications detected.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity, as while detection may represent a potential persistence threat, it could also involve legitimate applications and installations. Analysts should investigate based on context to determine the true nature of the activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses an obscure method of creating persistence that circumvents common registry paths or if they manipulate registry keys outside the usual monitored locations. Additionally, benign add-in installations and legitimate software behaviors can cause false positives, which may divert efforts away from genuine threats. Attackers may also disguise their malicious add-ins using custom or less recognized processes. Without comprehensive telemetry monitoring, certain methods of persistence may remain undetected, emphasizing the need for multi-faceted detection strategies.

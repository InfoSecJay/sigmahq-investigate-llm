  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "ETW Logging Disabled For rpcrt4.dll" is designed to detect alterations made to the registry key responsible for enabling Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logging for the rpcrt4.dll, which is a critical component for remote procedure calls in Windows. This rule monitors changes to the `ExtErrorInformation` key located in the Windows Registry, specifically looking for values that disable ETW logging. The malicious alteration of this registry key can be indicative of an adversary attempting to hide their activities by disabling logging, which is a form of defense evasion under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically aligning with the techniques T1112 (Modify Registry) and T1562 (Impair Defense). The primary data source for this detection is the Windows Registry, where changes to system behaviors and configurations are recorded.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Utilize a registry monitoring tool to check for any recent changes made to the `ExtErrorInformation` key. Look for timestamps that correlate with the alert generation for context.
    
  - **Analyze Event Logs:** Access Windows Event Logs, specifically the Security and System logs, to gather more information about user actions and system activities occurring around the time of the registry change.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Check EDR tools for any alerts that may indicate suspicious processes or behavior linked to the modification of the registry key. This can provide insight into whether associated malicious activity was detected.
  - **Consult System Baselines:** Compare the current state of the registry with established baselines to determine if the change is an anomaly or part of a legitimate update/operation that should be further investigated.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as low severity; however, any modification to the ETW logging setting could indicate an attempt to evade detection mechanisms, warranting further investigation to rule out potential malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry modification is performed through a method that does not generate events logged by the standard registry monitoring configurations, or if log retention policies lead to the loss of relevant historic data. Furthermore, it assumes that all changes to the registry are logged appropriately; if logging is disabled or misconfigured by the attacker, the detection mechanism may fail. Additionally, if the change was made during legitimate maintenance or updates, it could produce false positives, necessitating context-aware investigations.

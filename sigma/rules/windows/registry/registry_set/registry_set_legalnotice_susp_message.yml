  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma detection rule targets potential ransomware activities by monitoring changes to the Windows Registry keys associated with the "LegalNoticeCaption" and "LegalNoticeText". Ransomware strains frequently modify these registry values to display ransom messages on infected machines, using specific keywords including "encrypted", "Unlock-Password", and "paying". The rule observes the Windows Registry changes to identify suspicious activity that exhibits these characteristics, leveraging the "registry_set" category of event logging. By focusing on changes that include these indicators, the rule facilitates early detection under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Impact (Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1491.001). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Use Windows Event Logs to verify the timestamps and sources of changes made to the "LegalNoticeCaption" and "LegalNoticeText" registry values. Identify the user account that initiated these changes.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Use an EDR solution to correlate the timing of the registry changes with process creation events. Look for associated processes that are commonly linked with ransomware such as those invoking PowerShell or other scripting tools.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Investigate any unusual outbound network connections at the time of the detected registry modification using your NDR tool. Look for connections to known malicious IPs or domains that may have been involved in prior ransomware incidents.
  - **Scan for Known Ransomware Signatures:** Utilize your AV and EDR solutions to perform a comprehensive scan on the affected endpoint. Identify and quarantine any suspicious files or known ransomware signatures.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule is marked as high severity due to the critical nature of ransomware activities, which can lead to significant data loss and operational downtime if left unchecked. Immediate investigation and containment measures are recommended.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if the ransomware employs techniques to obfuscate registry modifications or if it utilizes non-standard keys that do not contain the specific keywords. Additionally, if the attacker gains sufficient privileges to alter these settings stealthily or if they manage to delete logs prior to the execution of ransomware activities, this detection method may be circumvented. Additionally, legitimate software that utilizes similar keywords in registry changes could lead to false positives; thus, analysts should have an understanding of normal environment behavior.

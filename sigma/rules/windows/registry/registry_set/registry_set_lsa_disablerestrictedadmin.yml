  Detects changes to the "DisableRestrictedAdmin" registry value in order to disable or enable RestrictedAdmin mode.
  RestrictedAdmin mode prevents the transmission of reusable credentials to the remote system to which you connect using Remote Desktop.
  This prevents your credentials from being harvested during the initial connection process if the remote server has been compromise

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting "RestrictedAdminMode Registry Value Tampering" is focused on monitoring changes to a specific Windows registry entry: `DisableRestrictedAdmin`. This registry value plays a critical role in managing the security of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions. When set to '1', the value enables RestrictedAdmin mode, which prevents the transmission of reusable credentials during RDP connections. In contrast, if tampered with and set to '0', it allows such credential transmissions, thereby increasing the risk of credential theft if the target system is compromised. 
  The detection rule operates by leveraging Windows registry set logs to identify any modifications to this registry value. It specifically inspects all actions that modify values in the `System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` path to catch potentially malicious activities orchestrated by threat actors aiming to disable protections and exploit legitimate access protocols. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and specifically targets technique T1112, which involves modification of registry values to bypass security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Utilize a Windows Event Log solution to verify the timestamp and user context of the registry change on `DisableRestrictedAdmin`, ensuring to check for any administrative or unauthorized accounts involved in the action.
  - **Correlate with Process Creation Logs:** Check EDR logs for any process creation events around the time of the detected registry change to identify any suspicious processes that may have been responsible for the manipulation.
  - **Monitor RDP Sessions:** Review RDP connection logs in your network monitoring tool to identify any unusual or unauthorized connection attempts that coincided with the registry modification.
  - **Audit User Accounts:** Identify and audit user accounts that may have administrative permissions to alter registry settings, ensuring proper security measures are in place to limit such permissions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the significant security implications of tampering with the `DisableRestrictedAdmin` registry value, potentially exposing sensitive credentials to unauthorized entities, especially within an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if registry changes occur through non-standard methods or if an attacker utilizes direct memory manipulation techniques to alter values without utilizing typical user-space processes. Furthermore, the rule assumes that relevant logging is enabled and that there are no existing filters or policies that prevent registry changes from being logged. Adversaries may employ techniques to mask their activities, such as clearing logs immediately after making changes, potentially evading detection entirely.

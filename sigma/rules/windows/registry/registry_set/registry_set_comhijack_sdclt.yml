  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "COM Hijack via Sdclt" is designed to detect potential privilege escalation attempts that exploit a specific Windows registry key: `HKCU\Software\Classes\Folder\shell\open\command\DelegateExecute`. This registry key is associated with the functionality of the Windows Backup Utility (Sdclt), which can be manipulated to redirect command execution, effectively allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code at a higher privilege level than granted by the current user context. This rule utilizes Windows registry logs to monitor for changes to this key, indicating possible adversarial behavior aligned with privilege escalation tactics. It specifically relates to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1546 (Event Triggered Execution) and T1548 (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Use a registry monitoring tool or Windows Event Logs to confirm recent changes to the `HKCU\Software\Classes\Folder\shell\open\command\DelegateExecute` key and identify the source of the modification.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs surrounding the time of the registry change to identify any suspicious processes that may have been executed and their command-line arguments.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Use the EDR system to correlate behavior and alerts with other indicators of compromise, such as unusual file access or execution patterns that may suggest privilege escalation attempts.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Check user activity logs (e.g., command history, login sessions) to understand the context under which the registry changes were made, focusing on any abnormal user behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity since changes to this registry key can indicate multiple forms of security bypass and exploitation that could compromise system integrity and elevate privileges, making this type of behavior a critical concern for incident response teams.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that relevant logging is enabled and properly configured on all endpoints. Potential blind spots include environments that do not monitor registry changes consistently or those where permissions allow non-admin users to modify registry keys. Additionally, adversaries may utilize techniques to evade detection, such as clearing logs after making modifications or altering the registry in ways that do not trigger alerts.

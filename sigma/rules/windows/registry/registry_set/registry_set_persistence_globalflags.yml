  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential Persistence Via GlobalFlags" detection rule identifies registry manipulation techniques that could indicate malicious persistence mechanisms on Windows systems. Specifically, it focuses on two primary registry keys related to persistence and process management: the GlobalFlags and SilentProcessExit keys. By monitoring registry set operations that include these keys within critical paths such as `\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\` and `\Image File Execution Options\`, the rule can detect alterations that may be used by threat actors to maintain control over compromised systems. The presence of these entries can often signal an attempt to execute hidden or stealthy processes, enhancing the potential for privilege escalation and evasion of defenses.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use EDR tools to query the Windows registry for recent changes to the GlobalFlags and SilentProcessExit settings, particularly in the mentioned paths. Look for unusual entries that may indicate malicious activity.
  - **Analyze Process Execution:** Utilize EDR to examine the process creation logs to identify any processes that were started with these specific settings. Focus on any processes that exhibit unusual behavior or are not typical for your environment.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Check firewall and network logs for any outbound connections initiated by processes linked to the suspicious registry modifications. This can help in determining if the altered processes are attempting to communicate with command and control servers.
  - **Cross-reference with Antivirus Logs:** Review antivirus logs for detections related to processes that may have been flagged as potentially malicious due to registry-related anomalies. This can provide additional context and help corroborate findings.

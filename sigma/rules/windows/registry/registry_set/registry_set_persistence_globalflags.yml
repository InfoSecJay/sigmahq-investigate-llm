  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Persistence Via GlobalFlags" is designed to detect potential persistence mechanisms employed by adversaries using Windows registry modifications. Specifically, it looks for changes to the GlobalFlags settings within the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) and the SilentProcessExit keys, which are commonly exploited to manipulate process behaviors stealthily. By monitoring these registry paths, the rule identifies attempts to create persistence mechanisms that can enable an attacker to hide malware or maintain access to compromised systems. 
  The primary data sources involved in this detection rule are the Windows Registry logs, specifically focusing on the actions that pertain to the GlobalFlags and SilentProcessExit settings. These entries can indicate malicious behavior typical of privilege escalation, persistence, and defense evasion techniques, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of privilege escalation (`T1068`) and persistence (`T1546.012`).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Check the Windows Registry for recent modifications to the `\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\GlobalFlag` and `SilentProcessExit` keys to determine whether unauthorized changes have been made.
  - **Correlate with Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the processes that may have spawned as a result of the modified configurations. Look for unusual parent-child process relationships or processes running with elevated privileges.
  - **Analyze Related Network Connections:** Cross-reference any flagged behavior with network connections to identify whether the affected processes communicated with suspicious external IP addresses. Use NDR tools to spot any anomalies.
  - **Assess for Other Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Utilize log sources such as AV and Sysmon to identify any other related behaviors or artifacts that may indicate a broader compromise, such as persistence mechanisms or lateral movement attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity level within an enterprise environment as it indicates potential persistence tactics that could facilitate ongoing unauthorized access and control over systems. The implications of persistence measures need immediate investigation to prevent long-term exploitation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if adversaries use alternative persistence methods not involving the monitored registry keys. Additionally, if the registry has been modified or logged in ways that obscure these changes (e.g., certain anti-forensic techniques), the detection may fail. Furthermore, users with legitimate administrative privileges may create similar registry changes for benign purposes, potentially leading to false positives.

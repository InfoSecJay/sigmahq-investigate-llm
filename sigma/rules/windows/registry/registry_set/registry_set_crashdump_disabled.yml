  ### Technical Context
  The "CrashControl CrashDump Disabled" Sigma rule is designed to detect when the CrashDump feature in Windows has been disabled via modifications to the registry. The rule specifically monitors changes to the registry path `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl`, focusing on instances where the value is set to `DWORD (0x00000000)`. Disabling CrashDump can prevent the operating system from creating memory dump files that could be useful for post-incident analysis and debugging, making this behavior indicative of potential malicious activity, such as the actions employed by malware like HermeticWiper. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1564 (System Script Proxy Execution) and T1112 (Modification of Registry).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Change in Registry:** Use Windows Event Logs to confirm that a modification to the `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl` registry key has occurred around the time of the alert.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to examine any processes that were active at the time the registry key was modified, identifying any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
  - **Check for Associated Malicious Activity:** Review other related logs such as Sysmon event logs for any unusual application behavior or system events that coincide with the registry change.
  - **Review User and Remote Access Logs:** Inspect user access and VPN logs for any anomalous behaviors or connections that may indicate unauthorized access prior to the registry modification.
  ### Prioritization
  Given its potential implications for incident response and forensic investigations, this alert is prioritized as medium severity. The disabling of crash dumps can hinder the ability to effectively analyze and respond to security incidents, warranting prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate administrative activities involve disabling of crash dumps, which can lead to false positives. Additionally, adversaries may employ methods to obscure their actions, such as bypassing detection mechanisms or reverting registry changes, resulting in missed detections. Furthermore, reliance on Windows registry changes assumes that adversaries will not employ alternative tactics to disable crash dumps or execute malicious activity.

title: Bypass UAC Using SilentCleanup Task
id: 724ea201-6514-4f38-9739-e5973c34f49a
status: test
description: |
  Detects the setting of the environement variable "windir" to a non default value.
  Attackers often abuse this variable in order to trigger a UAC bypass via the "SilentCleanup" task.
  The SilentCleanup task located in %windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe is an auto-elevated task that can be abused to elevate any file with administrator privileges without prompting UAC.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential privilege escalation attempts through the manipulation of the Windows environment variable "windir." Adversaries may modify this variable to point to a non-default value, thus leveraging the SilentCleanup task to bypass User Account Control (UAC). The SilentCleanup task is automatically elevated and found in `%windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe`, enabling attackers to execute files with administrative privileges without generating a UAC prompt. The rule focuses specifically on registry changes that set the "windir" variable, monitoring the Windows Registry as its primary data source. The detected activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of privilege escalation (TA0004) and the technique T1548.002, which covers various methods adversaries use to bypass UAC.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes**: Utilize Windows Event Logs or EDR tools to confirm the creation or modification of the "windir" environment variable. Pay special attention to the timestamp of the change relative to any other suspicious activities.
  - **Check Task Scheduler for SilentCleanup**: Investigate the Task Scheduler for any instances of SilentCleanup (`cleanmgr.exe`) running, focusing on execution times and associated user accounts that triggered the task.
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs**: Analyze process creation logs to identify any processes launched in close proximity to the registry change. Look for indicators such as abnormal parent-child relationships or unusual command-line arguments.
  - **User Activity Correlation**: Check firewall, proxy, or VPN logs to correlate user activities before and after the suspicious registry entry. This can provide insight into whether the action was a legitimate administrative function or malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is marked as high severity due to the potential for an attacker to elevate privileges unnoticed, which can lead to significant risk, including unauthorized access to sensitive resources and the capability to execute further malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One assumption is that all environment variable changes will be logged, which might not be the case in systems with disabled logging or in environments where Group Policies overwrite certain settings. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may revert changes quickly to avoid detection or use alternative methods for privilege escalation that do not involve modifying the "windir" variable. Therefore, analysts should also consider other behavior indicative of privilege escalation, as reliance solely on this rule could lead to missed incidents.

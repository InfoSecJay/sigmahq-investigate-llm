  ### Technical Context
  The "Office Autorun Keys Modification" Sigma rule is designed to detect unauthorized modifications to autostart extensibility points (ASEPs) in the Windows registry, particularly those associated with Microsoft Office applications. Adversaries frequently leverage these registry keys to execute malicious code automatically when Office applications are launched, thereby maintaining persistence on compromised systems. The rule specifically monitors changes to registry paths that contain "Microsoft\Office" to identify modifications made to various addins across popular Office applications, including Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Access. The key data sources involved in this detection include Windows Registry logs, which capture registry manipulations and provide insight into these potentially malicious changes. This detection correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence (T1547.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes**: Use the Windows Registry Editor or SIEM to review recent changes associated with the registry paths monitored by this rule. Look for modifications made to autorun keys relevant to Office applications.
  - **Examine Process Activity**: Leverage EDR tools to investigate whether any unusual processes were launched around the same time the registry changes occurred, particularly looking for non-standard or obfuscated executable names.
  - **Review User Activity Logs**: Check user activity logs, including Windows Event Logs and Office application logs, to see if any legitimate administrator actions correspond to the detected changes.
  - **Assess for Legitimate Software**: Investigate if the identified registry changes correlate with legitimate software installations or updates, as authorized applications may modify these keys during their deployment.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for these registry modifications to signify unauthorized persistence mechanisms by attackers, alerts from this rule should be prioritized as medium severity. Such changes can lead to further exploitation if not properly contained.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses legitimate software installations to alter autorun keys, as automatic modifications during these processes could be misclassified as benign. Additionally, if known addins are legitimately being used, those modifications can evade detection. It's also assumed that all systems are consistently monitored for registry changes; if some systems lack the necessary logging or if logging is disabled, key modifications could go undetected.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potentially suspicious behavior involving Microsoft Office documents, specifically when registry changes related to trust records occur in unexpected or uncommon locations. The focus is on identifying when malicious actors manipulate settings that determine whether macros in Office documents may run without prompting users or requiring their consent. By examining registry changes related to trusted documents under `\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords`, the rule helps to uncover attempts at defense evasion, a tactic commonly utilized by adversaries to circumvent security measures. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique associated with this rule is T1112 (Modify Registry).
  The primary data source involved in this detection is Windows Registry logs, specifically monitoring changes in registry keys that contain paths to potentially suspicious locations for stored trusted documents. This includes common directories such as `AppData`, `Temp`, and public locations that do not typically house legitimate Office documents. By cross-referencing these changes against expected usage patterns, the rule can identify potentially malicious actions that require further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Use Windows Registry tools to analyze the changes made to the `\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords`. Look for any entries from locations that contrast with standard user behavior.
    
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Review event logs for the user account associated with the registry changes. Examine logins, web activity, and file downloads, especially for any suspicious document access leading up to the change.
  - **Assess Document Usage:** Check the environment for any recent downloads or creations of macro-enabled documents (e.g., .docm, .xlsm) in the suspicious paths identified by the rule alerts. Use EDR tools for visibility into document-related activities.
  - **Review User Context and Environment:** Investigate the userâ€™s role and legitimacy regarding the activity. Understand whether the user typically interacts with such documents and if any role-based policy violations occurred.
  ### Prioritization
  The detection is classified as high-severity due to the potential for macro-enabled documents to execute malicious code, enabling threats such as ransomware, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network. Quick identification and response are necessary to mitigate risk.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary utilizes more uncommon or legitimate paths for trusted documents to evade detection. Moreover, if a user legitimately changes registry settings or operates in unusual locations due to a specific business need, this may result in false positives. Additionally, the rule assumes that all endpoints are logging registry changes comprehensively; any gaps in logging may hinder coverage and detection effectiveness.

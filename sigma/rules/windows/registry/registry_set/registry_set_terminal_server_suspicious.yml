  Detects tampering of RDP Terminal Service/Server sensitive settings.
  Such as allowing unauthorized users access to a system via the 'fAllowUnsolicited' or enabling RDP via 'fDenyTSConnections', etc.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential tampering of sensitive Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) settings in Windows operating systems. Specifically, it monitors for changes to registry keys that control RDP access, such as `fDenyTSConnections`, `fSingleSessionPerUser`, and `UserAuthentication`. When these values are set to zero, it could indicate that the system allows unrestricted RDP connections or multiple concurrent sessions, which could increase the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems. The rule utilizes Windows registry logs to identify these changes, which can be sourced from Windows Security or System logs. This detection is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1112) and Persistence, as it can signify malicious attempts to maintain access to a system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine System Logs:** Check Windows Security and System logs for any recent registry modifications to the specified RDP settings, correlating the time with user activity or incident reports.
  - **Review User Sessions:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate active RDP sessions, looking for any unusual user accounts or concurrent sessions that exceed normal usage patterns.
  - **Analyze Access Attempts:** Scrutinize any incoming RDP connection attempts through the NGFW logs, noting source IPs and user accounts used for access.
  - **Check Audit Policies:** Review whether auditing for user logins or failed login attempts is enabled to identify potential unauthorized access attempts following the registry changes.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been classified as medium severity due to the critical nature of RDP access. Unauthorized configuration of RDP settings can facilitate an attacker's ability to gain persistent access and control over enterprise systems, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule effectively identifies specific registry changes, it may not trigger if authorized administrators modify these settings for legitimate purposes, such as deploying group policies. Furthermore, if an adversary employs methods to mask their activities, like utilizing a kernel-mode driver to modify registry values, this rule may also fail to fire.

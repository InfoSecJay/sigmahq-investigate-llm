  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect changes to the user account associated with the FAX service on Windows systems. Specifically, it monitors the Windows registry path `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Fax\ObjectName` for alterations, focusing on instances where the user account is set to "NetworkService." The rationale behind this detection is to prevent unauthorized escalation of privileges, as modifying the user account for the FAX service can indicate malicious intentions, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation by an adversary. By leveraging Windows registry set logs, the rule captures relevant changes that could signify potential security incidents. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** and specifically relates to technique **T1112: Modify Registry**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Examine recent Windows Security and System Event Logs for any notable activities around the time of the user account change on the FAX service. Look for potential anomalies or related suspicious events.
  - **Analyze Registry Change:** Utilize registry monitoring tools to confirm the change to `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Fax\ObjectName` and identify what user account was set prior to the modification.
  - **Monitor User Activity:** Check the EDR for related user activity, especially focusing on the account that was changed. Investigate recent logins, process creation, and any executed commands from that user.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to analyze any network connections made by the service or associated user account, identifying any unusual data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is rated as high because unauthorized changes to service account configurations can lead to significant security risks, including privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network. Such alterations can compromise the integrity of the server and expose sensitive data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule depends on the accuracy of registry monitoring; it may not trigger if other methods are used to change the service account outside the registry or if an attacker alters the logs to avoid detection. Additionally, if legitimate service account changes occur without proper process controls or documentation, they may lead to false positives. Engineers must consider the context of the environment and ensure that the registry has not been tampered with prior to monitoring.

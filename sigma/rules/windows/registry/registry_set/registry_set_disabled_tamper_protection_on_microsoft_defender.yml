  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential unauthorized attempts to disable the Tamper Protection feature of Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is a key security measure designed to prevent malicious modifications to the antivirus settings. The rule focuses on a registry modification that changes the specific registry key associated with Tamper Protection (located at `\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Features\TamperProtection`) to a value indicating it is disabled (DWORD value `0x00000000`). This action is logged through Windows Registry events, which can be captured and analyzed using Sysmon or other monitoring tools that track registry changes.
  When Tamper Protection is disabled, it leaves the system vulnerable to various threats, as adversaries may disable security software to facilitate their attacks. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** and specifically the technique **T1562.001**, which focuses on disabling security features to avoid detection or analysis.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Review the Windows Registry events to confirm the tamper protection settings change. Focus on the key `\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Features\TamperProtection` and check whether the value is set to `0`.
  - **Process Investigation:** Utilize EDR tools to identify any suspicious processes that may have executed just prior to the registry modification. Look for any processes that may have an unusual parent/child relationship or those that are unrecognized in your environment.
  - **Review Security Event Logs:** Examine Windows Security logs for any events correlating with the time of the registry change. Check for any security-related alerts that may indicate attempts to disable or tamper with security features.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** If available, analyze network activity around the affected endpoint for unusual connections around the time of the registry change. This may reveal potential C2 communications or malicious downloads accompanying the tampering of security measures.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential risk it poses to the enterprise environment. Disabling Tamper Protection opens the door for an attacker to manipulate security controls, which could lead to further exploitation or data breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule focuses on detecting changes to the Tamper Protection setting, it may not fire if the modification is performed in a manner that avoids detection (e.g., via a legitimate administrative action or through stealthy malware that mimics trusted processes). Additionally, there may be scenarios where the registry key is modified temporarily during system updates, which can lead to false positives if not properly filtered. Engineers should also ensure that Sysmon and similar logging mechanisms are implemented correctly to capture all necessary events consistently.

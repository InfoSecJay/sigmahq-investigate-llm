  Detects when the "index" value of a scheduled task is modified from the registry
  Which effectively hides it from any tooling such as "schtasks /query" (Read the referenced link for more information about the effects of this technique)

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects modifications to the "index" value of scheduled tasks within the Windows registry, specifically targeting the registry path `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree\`. By altering this index value to `DWORD (0x00000000)`, an attacker can effectively hide a scheduled task from standard command-line tools such as `schtasks /query`. This behavior is a form of defense evasion (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562), as it seeks to obfuscate malicious activity from security tools and analysts. The rule is designed to utilize telemetry from registry change events to identify these manipulations, alerting the SOC team to potential adversaries attempting to conceal their activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Examine Windows Event Logs for recent registry changes related to scheduled tasks. Focus on the path containing `TaskCache\Tree\` to confirm the index modification.
    
  - **Utilize EDR Tools:** Leverage EDR solutions to identify processes that made changes to the registry around the same timestamp as the index modification. This may provide insights into the executing method of the potential threat.
  - **Correlate with Task List:** Cross-reference the detected modification with the current list of scheduled tasks using `schtasks` to determine if any hidden tasks are present and assess their legitimacy.
  - **Investigate Process Activity:** Look into any suspicious process creation events around the time of the registry modification using Sysmon logs. Pay attention to command-line arguments and parent-child process relationships to uncover possible malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of this behavior—modifying system settings to hide malicious tasks from detection—this alert is prioritized as high severity. Scheduled tasks can persist across reboots, making them a serious threat if left unnoticed.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  Potential blind spots include scenarios where legitimate applications may modify task settings for benign reasons, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, if an adversary uses methods such as direct filesystem manipulation or uses legitimate system procedures, the rule may not trigger as intended. Analysts should be aware that skilled threat actors may employ evasion tactics to avoid detection, which can undermine the effectiveness of this rule.

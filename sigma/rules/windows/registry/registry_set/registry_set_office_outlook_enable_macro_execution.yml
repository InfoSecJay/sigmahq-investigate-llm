  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect a change in Microsoft Outlook's security settings that allows for the execution of macros without user prompts. Specifically, it identifies modifications made to the Windows registry, particularly the `Outlook\Security\Level` key, where a value of `0x00000001` corresponds to enabling all macros. This change poses a significant security risk as it can be exploited by malicious actors to execute harmful scripts without user consent, thereby allowing for persistence and command-and-control activity. The rule leverages the Windows registry as its primary data source, targeting modifications that may indicate unauthorized adjustments to application security settings. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of persistence (T1546) and command-and-control (T1137).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Change:** Use a Windows registry monitoring tool or a SIEM to confirm that the `Outlook\Security\Level` value was indeed set to `0x00000001`. Look for the timeline of changes to help identify when the modification occurred.
  - **Check for Related Events:** Investigate surrounding events in Windows Security and Sysmon logs for unusual file operations or process creations that may indicate malicious activity following the registry change.
  - **Analyze Email Activity:** Utilize email security tools or logs to explore any recent potentially suspicious emails that may have contained macros, particularly those opened shortly before the registry change was detected.
  - **Validate User Actions:** Cross-reference the timestamp of the registry change with user activities (e.g., logins, usage patterns) to determine if the change aligns with legitimate user activity or if it appears anomalous.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for undetected exploitation by attackers who leverage macro execution as a vector for delivering malicious payloads, compromising systems, and establishing persistence within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker utilizes legitimate administrative privileges to change the registry setting directly without generating notable events. Additionally, environments with strict group policies or managed security software that prevent registry changes may not trigger this rule. It is assumed that all relevant logs are correctly configured and collected; otherwise, there may be lapses in detection. Furthermore, users may have legitimate reasons for adjusting these settings, so context and intent should be assessed carefully.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Internet Explorer Autorun Keys Modification" Sigma rule is designed to detect unauthorized modifications to the Autostart Extensibility Points (ASEP) related to Internet Explorer in the Windows registry. This rule specifically monitors changes to certain registry keys associated with Internet Explorer, such as those found in the `\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer` and `\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer` paths. By looking for alterations in these keys, particularly within subkeys such as `\Toolbar` or `\Extensions`, the rule aims to identify potential persistence mechanisms employed by threat actors to maintain control over compromised systems.
  This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic of "Persistence" and Technique T1547.001, which focuses on modifying registry keys to achieve persistence. The telemetry from Windows registry activities provides visibility into unauthorized changes, enabling security teams to respond swiftly to potential threats that utilize these techniques.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Check EDR logs for alerts that correlate with registry modifications related to Internet Explorer, focusing on the specific keys mentioned in the rule.
  - **Analyze Registry Changes**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the detected registry changes using tools like `regedit` or PowerShell to view the context of the modifications, including timestamps and associated processes.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Cross-reference detected changes in the registry with user activity logs from Windows Event Logs or session data to determine if the modification was legitimate or suspicious.
  - **Check Network Activity**: Use network detection tools to check for any anomalous outbound connections or communications initiated by the affected processes post-modification, which might indicate malware behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule is assigned a medium severity level as it indicates potential persistence mechanisms that could be associated with malicious activities. However, the presence of legitimate software modifying registry keys can lead to false positives, necessitating careful validation during investigations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if changes are made to registry keys using methods that do not generate typical registry change events or if the modifications occur rapidly and outside the scope of monitoring. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities might alter these keys, potentially obscuring malicious intent. It is assumed that sufficient logging and monitoring capabilities are in place; otherwise, the detection of such modifications could be incomplete, allowing adversaries to gain persistence without detection.

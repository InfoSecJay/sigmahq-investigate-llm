  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects instances where an adversary attempts to disable the Microsoft Defender Firewall by modifying specific registry values. Firewalls are critical security controls, and disabling them can create a vulnerability within the system, potentially allowing unauthorized network access. The rule specifically looks for changes in the Windows Registry concerning the `EnableFirewall` setting within the firewall policies for Domain, Public, and Standard Profiles. When the value of this key is set to '0' (DWORD 0x00000000), it indicates that the firewall is disabled. The data sources involved in this detection include Windows Registry logs. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically under technique T1562.004, which focuses on the modification of security controls to bypass defenses.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query Windows Registry Logs**: Utilize Windows Security logs to inspect the registry modifications. Focus on changes related to the `EnableFirewall` setting within the defined registry paths.
    
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts**: Check the EDR for any alerts or related process activity that corresponds to the time of the registry modification. Look for any processes that may have performed the change, noting executable names or hashes.
    
  - **Review System Event Logs**: Cross-reference with Windows System logs around the same timestamp to identify if there were any system-level events, such as shutdowns or restarts, that correlate with the modification event.
    
  - **Check Network Connections**: Investigate any network connections or outbound traffic that occurred following the firewall disablement. This includes querying firewall logs or network connections to identify unusual behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is medium, as disabling the Windows Defender Firewall can significantly increase the risk of unauthorized network access and compromise, necessitating timely investigation and remediation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where registry auditing is not enabled or if adversaries employ sophisticated methods to manipulate the registry without triggering logs (e.g., using legitimate trusted applications with system permissions). Moreover, the rule assumes no other security controls are in place that would prevent modifications to the firewall settings. Additionally, if the registry permissions are overly permissive or previously modified by legitimate applications, it may create blind spots that allow such modifications to occur without triggering alerts.

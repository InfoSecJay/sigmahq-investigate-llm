title: MaxMpxCt Registry Value Changed
id: 0e6a9e62-627e-496c-aef5-bfa39da29b5e
status: test

  Detects changes to the "MaxMpxCt" registry value.
  MaxMpxCt specifies the maximum outstanding network requests for the server per client, which is used when negotiating a Server Message Block (SMB) connection with a client. Note if the value is set beyond 125 older Windows 9x clients will fail to negotiate.
  Ransomware threat actors and operators (specifically BlackCat) were seen increasing this value in order to handle a higher volume of traffic.

  ### Technical Context
  The "MaxMpxCt Registry Value Changed" detection rule monitors changes to the "MaxMpxCt" registry value which is located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters`. This value determines the maximum number of outstanding network requests that can be handled by the Windows Server for each client during Server Message Block (SMB) negotiations. This is particularly pertinent in the context of ransomware threats, where malicious actors, including the BlackCat ransomware group, may increase this value to manage a higher volume of malicious traffic and requests. If this value is set beyond 125, it can cause compatibility issues with older Windows 9x clients. The rule is pertinent to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Defense Evasion" and technique "Indicator Removal on Host (T1070.005)" as altering the MaxMpxCt value may assist adversaries in evading detection or maintaining persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Registry Change:** Check the Windows Registry for modifications to the `MaxMpxCt` value immediately following the alert to confirm the change and note the timestamp for further analysis.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate any process creation logs around the time of the registry change to identify any potentially malicious processes or routines that may have executed in response to this alteration.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Examine network connection logs, particularly those associated with SMB traffic, to identify any increased traffic patterns or unexpected outbound connections originating from the host where the change was made.
  - **Evaluate Historical Changes:** Use version history or previous snapshots of the registry to assess if there are recurring changes to the `MaxMpxCt` value which could indicate ongoing adversarial activity or misconfiguration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as low severity; however, it should not be dismissed. Registry changes of this nature can indicate potential preparations for attacks, particularly in conjunction with other suspicious activities within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the registry modification occurs too quickly for logging systems to capture or if appropriate registry monitoring configurations are not in place. Additionally, adversaries may use legitimate administrative access or tools to modify registry values without triggering alerts. Therefore, the assumption that all registry changes are malicious can lead to false negatives.

description: Detects modification to the "Default" value of the "MyComputer" key and
  subkeys to point to a custom binary that will be launched whenever the associated
  action is executed (see reference section for example)

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential persistence mechanisms employed by adversaries via modifications to the Windows Registry, specifically targeting the "MyComputer" registry keys. When an attacker alters the "Default" value of these keys or their subkeys, they can redirect certain actions to a custom binary, thereby maintaining persistence across system reboots or user sessions. The primary technical data sources involved are the registry modification logs captured via Windows Security logs. By monitoring for entries where `TargetObject` contains the path `\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer` and the key name ends with `Default`, this rule adheres to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence, particularly under the techniques pertaining to registry run keys and services.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Registry Modifications:** Use PowerShell or Registry Editor to check recent modifications to the `MyComputer` registry keys for any suspicious alterations that may point to unauthorized binaries.
  - **Analyze Process Execution:** Investigate any newly executed processes around the time of the registry key modification using an EDR tool to determine if they correlate with the changes and whether they exhibit malicious behavior.
  - **Review Security Logs:** Query Windows Security logs to assess any related logins or account activities that coincide with the registry changes to identify potential unauthorized access.
  - **Monitor Network Connections:** Utilize network logging tools to identify any outbound connections from newly introduced binaries that may indicate command and control activities or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be treated with high priority, as modifications to the registry for persistence can indicate foundational adversary presence in the environment, suggesting potential for further malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the modifications are conducted through means not captured in Windows Security logs, such as direct registry access via malicious software that operates with escalated privileges. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes legitimate administrative tools to make these changes, the rule may also produce false negatives. Assumptions include the necessity of proper logging configurations in Windows environments; if logging is disabled or improperly configured, key modifications may go unnoticed.

title: Modification of IE Registry Settings

status: test
description: Detects modification of the registry settings used for Internet Explorer
  and other Windows components that use these settings. An attacker can abuse this
  registry key to add a domain to the trusted sites Zone or insert javascript for
  persistence

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on detecting unauthorized modifications to the Windows registry settings related to Internet Explorer (IE) and other components that rely on these settings. The rule specifically looks for changes to keys within the `\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings` path, which can be manipulated by attackers to add untrusted domains to the trusted sites zone or to insert malicious JavaScript for persistence, presenting a significant security risk. By monitoring `registry_set` log sources, particularly for operations that include certain filtered data types (e.g., `DWORD`, `Binary Data`) within specified paths related to cache, zone mappings, or visited sites, we aim to identify potentially nefarious activity. This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of *Defense Evasion* and technique T1112, which highlights an adversary's capability to leverage OS features to achieve their goals.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Recent Registry Changes:** Use your EDR tool to review the history of registry modifications, focusing specifically on the `\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings` path for any suspicious entries or patterns.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Correlate the timing of the registry modifications with process creation events to identify any potentially malicious processes that executed before or after the registry change.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Utilize NDR and firewall logs to trace any unusual outbound connections from the affected systems, especially those associated with newly added domains or sites on the trusted list.
  - **Review Active User Sessions:** Check for any logged-in user session during the time of the registry change through the Windows Security logs, which could indicate whether the modification was executed by an authenticated user or a suspicious background process.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been categorized as low severity; however, depending on the context within the enterprise environment, the execution of such modifications can lead to greater risks and should not be dismissed. Prompt investigation is warranted to ensure these changes are sanctioned and not indicative of a broader exploit.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is essential to recognize that legitimate applications may also alter registry settings without evident malicious intent, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an attacker utilizes rootkits or other methods of concealment, this rule may not trigger as expected since such techniques could obfuscate registry changes from standard log monitoring. Adversaries can also disable the event logging for registry changes to further evade detection.

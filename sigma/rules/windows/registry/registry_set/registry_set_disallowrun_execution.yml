  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect changes made to the Windows Registry that enforce a restriction on executable files through the DisallowRun key. Specifically, it monitors for modifications to the registry entry located at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun` where the value is set to `1` (DWORD). This setting effectively prevents users from executing specific programs, which is a tactic often utilized by threat actors for defense evasion to limit user access to critical system functionalities or to silence detection mechanisms. The key registry modification represents an intent to control or restrict the execution of applications, falling under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112 (Modification of Registry) within the Defense Evasion tactic.
  The rule uses the Windows registry set logs as data sources, allowing detection engineers and incident responders to analyze the context and scope of such modifications. By careful examination of the changes in registry values, security teams can ascertain whether they are part of legitimate administrative controls or potential malicious activities intended to hinder security measures or facilitate unauthorized actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Examine the Windows Registry (via regedit or PowerShell) to confirm the presence of the DisallowRun key and its current value. Cross-reference this with known policies to understand if the change is authorized.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Utilize Windows Security Event Logs to investigate user activity around the time the registry key was modified. Pay attention to any unusual account behaviors, particularly those that could indicate credential misuse.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Events:** Query Sysmon logs for any process creation events that coincided with the registry modification. Focus on the processes executed by users to see if any align with suspicious activity.
  - **Correlate with Endpoint Detection Logs:** Check alerts from the EDR platform for any malicious indicators associated with the same user or device around the time of the registry change. Look for signs of exploit attempts or unusual software behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for abuse by malicious actors attempting to manipulate software execution environments, hindering user operational capabilities, and possibly indicating broader malicious actions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several critical blind spots to be aware of: 
  - The rule may not trigger if the modification is made through alternate methods not logged by Windows or if the logging mechanism is disabled or misconfigured. 
  - Additionally, changes made via scripts executed with administrative privileges may bypass standard user activity monitoring.
  - It is assumed that all environment changes are logged appropriately—if logging levels are not configured to capture registry changes, the detections will fail. 
  - The success of this detection relies on the activity around registry modifications and may not flag specific malware that doesn’t utilize this method for execution prevention.

  Such as allowing unauthorized users access to a system via the 'fAllowUnsolicited' or enabling RDP via 'fDenyTSConnections'...etc

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies unauthorized modifications to critical Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) settings in Windows. Specifically, it monitors changes made to registry keys under the Terminal Services control path, focusing on settings such as `fAllowUnsolicited`, `fDenyTSConnections`, and other flags indicating permission levels for remote access. The objective of this rule is to alert security analysts to potential tampering that could enable RDP hijacking, thereby allowing malicious actors unauthorized access to systems. The key data sources involved include registry modification logs, as Windows registry settings govern the RDP service's operation. This alert is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion and Persistence, particularly the technique under T1112 (Modification of Registry).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes**: Utilize EDR tools to check logs of registry modifications for related keys under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal Server`. Look for any unauthorized or unusual changes.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Examine recent login activity through Windows Security logs, particularly events indicating remote desktop connections. This helps in determining whether the changes correlate with unauthorized account access.
  - **Check for Unusual Processes**: Use the EDR system to search for processes that may have manipulated RDP settings, particularly those associated with known threat actors or malware signatures related to RDP hijacking.
  - **Analyze Network Activity**: Inspect network logs from the NDR and firewall to identify any suspicious inbound connections on the RDP port (TCP/3389) that could indicate exploitation of modified settings.
  ### Prioritization
  An alert triggered by this rule is categorized as high severity due to the critical nature of RDP services and the potential for unauthorized access, which could lead to significant data breaches or system compromises.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that changes to the RDP-related registry keys are inherently malicious unless justified by administrative policy changes. It may not fire in environments where robust group policies override these settings frequently, leading to legitimate changes that would otherwise trigger the alert. Additionally, skilled adversaries may evade detection by implementing changes via direct action on the system rather than through standard operating procedures.

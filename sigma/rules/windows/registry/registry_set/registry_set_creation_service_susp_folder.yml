  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors the Windows registry for the creation of services with binaries stored in suspicious directories. Particularly, it focuses on registry keys related to service configurations, specifically those that denote the service's binary path and startup type. The rule looks for entries under the `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\` path that either point to executable files located in folders like `\Users\Public\`, `\Perflogs\`, `\ADMIN$\`, or `\Temp\`â€”all of which are often associated with malicious activity. The collected data includes registry modification logs that track both the target object and the image path details, helping to identify unauthorized service creation attempts. 
  The logic imposes specific conditions to mitigate false positives, particularly filtering out instances where the binary appears in safer directories, such as `\Common Files\`, along with relevant startup type indicators. The intent is to provide SOC analysts with actionable alerts when potentially malicious services are initiated from these high-risk locations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the EDR logs to identify the service creation event and determine the full command-line context at the time of execution.
  - Check the registry modifications in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\` to confirm the presence and characteristics of the volatile service.
  - Utilize the AV tool to scan the binaries located in the suspicious directories for malware signatures or known indicators of compromise.
  - Verify network activity via the proxy logs to assess if the suspicious service initiated any outbound connections that could indicate exfiltration or command-and-control communications.

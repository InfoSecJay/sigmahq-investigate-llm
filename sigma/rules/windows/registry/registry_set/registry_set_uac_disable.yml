  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "UAC Disabled" is designed to detect attempts by attackers to disable User Account Control (UAC) on Windows systems. UAC is a security feature that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system by prompting for permission when administrative actions are attempted. Disabling UAC can allow malicious software to execute with elevated privileges without alerts. This rule looks for instances where the registry value `EnableLUA` is set to `0`, indicating that UAC has been turned off. Specifically, it monitors registry changes under the path `\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`. The detection leverages Windows Registry logs as the primary data source. This activity relates to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for privilege escalation (T1548.002) and defense evasion, highlighting its significance in identifying potential threats within the enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Change:** Utilize a registry monitoring tool to confirm the change to the `EnableLUA` value and review the timestamp for when the modification occurred.
  - **Check User Activity:** Analyze Windows Security logs for any user account activity occurring around the same time as the registry change to identify potential unauthorized access or administrative actions.
  - **Examine Process Creation:** Use EDR tools to review any abnormal process creation events around the same timeframe to detect if any suspicious executables were launched following the UAC modification.
  - **Conduct Threat Intelligence Lookup:** Search threat intelligence databases for known indicators associated with the observed user activity or system changes to determine if they correlate with flagged malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential implications on system security when UAC is disabled. In an enterprise environment, this action could signal an ongoing compromise, thus requiring timely investigation to mitigate risks.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses methods other than direct registry modifications to disable UAC, or if such changes are executed by privileged accounts that might not trigger alerts. It assumes the appropriate logging level is enabled and that monitoring is in place across all relevant systems. Additionally, instances of benign configuration changes by legitimate administrators might lead to false positives, creating challenges in distinguishing between legitimate and malicious actions.

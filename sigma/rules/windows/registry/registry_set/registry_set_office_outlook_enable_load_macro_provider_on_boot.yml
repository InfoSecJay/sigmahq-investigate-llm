  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where the Outlook registry setting `LoadMacroProviderOnBoot` is modified to an enabled state (0x00000001). When this setting is enabled, it allows Microsoft Outlook to automatically load any configured Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) projects or modules upon startup. Malware actors can leverage this functionality to achieve persistence on a compromised system by embedding malicious VBA code within Outlook. The detection works by monitoring specific modifications in the Windows Registry, focusing on the registry path associated with Outlook settings. By capturing these changes, security teams can be alerted to potential indicators of compromise that might suggest an attempt to manipulate Outlook for malicious activities, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1546 (Event Triggered Execution).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Modification:** Review the Windows Registry under the path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<version>\Outlook` to confirm the modification of the `LoadMacroProviderOnBoot` setting.
    
  - **Review User Activity:** Investigate the user activity around the time of the modification using audit logs from Windows Security to determine if abnormal behavior was present, such as unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Examine Outlook VBA Projects:** Use tools like EDR or scripts to enumerate any loaded VBA projects in Outlook. Look for unexpected or suspicious modules that may have been added or modified.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Cross-reference process creation logs during the time of the modification to identify if any suspicious processes were initiated that could be linked to potential malware or persistence mechanisms.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity level because unauthorized changes to registry settings related to Outlook's startup behavior can facilitate persistent access for attackers, potentially leading to further compromise within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker modifies the registry in a manner that does not directly invoke the `LoadMacroProviderOnBoot` setting or if there are legitimate applications or scripts that also alter this registry setting without malicious intent. Additionally, if auditing for registry changes is not enabled or if the application usage logs are not properly monitored, critical activities might go unnoticed. Itâ€™s also important to consider that advanced adversaries may utilize techniques to obfuscate their actions or revert changes before detection.

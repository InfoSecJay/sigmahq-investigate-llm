  ### Technical Context
  The "ClickOnce Trust Prompt Tampering" Sigma rule is designed to detect unauthorized modifications to the Windows registry settings governing the ClickOnce trust prompt behavior. ClickOnce is a deployment technology that enables the installation of applications from the web, and it relies on specific registry keys to manage the security prompts that appear when users attempt to install software from various locations, including the Internet or local intranet. The rule specifically monitors changes to the registry key located at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\.NETFramework\Security\TrustManager\PromptingLevel\`, focusing on values that enable installations from potentially insecure locations. Such modifications may indicate an attempt by an adversary to bypass security measures to execute untrusted code, thereby falling under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112: Modify Registry. The primary data source for this detection is Windows registry logs, capturing any set registry actions that match the criteria specified.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes**: Utilize registry monitoring tools to review the specific changes made to the `PromptingLevel` key, focusing on timestamps and the user account that initiated the change.
  - **Correlate User Activity**: Use EDR tools to analyze the actions taken by the user who modified the registry key, looking for any other suspicious behavior or processes initiated from that account during the same timeframe.
  - **Review Application Installations**: Examine logs from Windows Event Viewer or relevant application installation logs to identify any recent installations triggered from untrusted locations following the registry modification.
  - **Cross-reference with Threat Intelligence**: Consult threat intelligence feeds for known indicators of compromise related to registry tampering or abnormal ClickOnce usage to assess intent and impact.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for significant impact if an attacker successfully evades ClickOnce prompts, thus enabling unauthorized applications to be installed and executed within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry changes are made by legitimate internal processes or users who have a valid business requirement to modify these settings. Additionally, if an adversary employs stealthy techniques to make registry changes without detection or uses alternative methods to bypass ClickOnce settings, the alert may not trigger. It is assumed that adequate monitoring of registry activity is in place; without this, potential threat actions could go unnoticed.

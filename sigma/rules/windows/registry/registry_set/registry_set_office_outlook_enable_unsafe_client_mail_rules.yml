  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Outlook EnableUnsafeClientMailRules Setting Enabled 
  - Registry" is designed to detect modifications to the Windows registry that enable a specific security setting in Microsoft Outlook. This setting, known as "EnableUnsafeClientMailRules," allows malicious actors to run applications or execute macros within Outlook, potentially leading to further compromise of the system or network. The detection focuses on registry changes logged by Windows, particularly observing changes to the `\Outlook\Security\EnableUnsafeClientMailRules` entry with a value indicating it has been set to 1 (DWORD: 0x00000001). 
  Utilizing Windows Security Event Logs, specifically registry modification events, this detection focuses on identifying potential defensive evasion tactics, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1112). By focusing on this registry key, the rule enables SOC analysts to swiftly identify unauthorized attempts to lower the security barriers in Outlook that could facilitate further attacks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Registry Changes:** Check the registry for recent modifications to `\Outlook\Security\EnableUnsafeClientMailRules`. Confirm if the change originated from authorized user accounts or processes.
  - **Review User Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate the user activity around the time of the registry change to see if it aligns with known user behaviors or access patterns.
  - **Correlate with Application Logs:** Examine Outlook logs and system/application logs around the time of change for any suspicious activity or anomalies that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Assess Network Traffic:** Utilize NDR tools to monitor any outbound network connections that may correlate with the timing of change, indicating potential communication with a command-and-control server.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the potential risk posed by enabling client mail rules in Outlook, which may allow an attacker to run malicious macros or scripts, potentially compromising sensitive data or gaining unauthorized access to additional systems within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several assumptions and limitations concerning this detection rule. First, the rule may not fire if the registry change is made using administrative accounts or processes that are exempt from logging. Additionally, legitimate applications or processes might enable this setting, leading to false positives. Furthermore, if an adversary uses obfuscation techniques or changes the registry in a way that bypasses normal logging, the detection might fail. It is crucial for detection engineers to understand the entire context of registry modifications and potential legitimate use cases.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potential persistence mechanisms via registry settings related to the Event Viewer, specifically targeting the `MicrosoftRedirectionProgram` and `MicrosoftRedirectionURL` keys. Adversaries may exploit these registry pathways to manipulate event handling and redirect users to malicious resources, thus maintaining persistence in the environment. The rule examines Windows registry events to detect whether these configurations contain unexpected or harmful values, particularly looking for settings associated with `svchost.exe`, which is often used by attackers to blend in with legitimate processes. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques include T1112 (Validation Controls) in the Persistence tactic, as it showcases how attackers may implement registry keys to maintain a foothold in a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Modifications:** Examine the Windows Registry Audit logs for changes to keys related to the Event Viewer, specifically under `\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer\`, looking for any unauthorized modifications.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Using EDR tools, review process behaviors for `svchost.exe` to identify whether it is being used inappropriately or if its command line parameters reference malicious URLs or configurations.
  - **Evaluate Network Traffic:** Review your network traffic logs for connections initiated by suspicious URLs (e.g., `http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp`) to determine if there are external communications linked to the alert.
  - **Review Group Policy Changes:** Investigate any recent Group Policy Object (GPO) changes that may have allowed redirection settings related to the Event Viewer to be altered, potentially providing insights into how an attacker may have gained persistence.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of this alert indicating potential registry manipulation for persistence, it is categorized as medium severity. Immediate investigation is essential, as registry persistence can facilitate undetected, long-term security breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary uses obfuscation techniques, alters the naming conventions, or uses alternate persistence methods not covered by this detection. Additionally, the rule relies on keys being correctly audited; if specific audit policies for the registry are not enabled, relevant activities could go undetected. Incident responders should also consider that legitimate software or updates may introduce changes to these registry paths, potentially leading to false positives.

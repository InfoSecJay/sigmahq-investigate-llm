description: |
  Detects when an attacker tries to change User Account Control (UAC) elevation request destination via the "PromptOnSecureDesktop" value.
  The "PromptOnSecureDesktop" setting specifically determines whether UAC prompts are displayed on the secure desktop. The secure desktop is a separate desktop environment that's isolated from other processes running on the system. It's designed to prevent malicious software from intercepting or tampering with UAC prompts.
  When "PromptOnSecureDesktop" is set to 0, UAC prompts are displayed on the user's current desktop instead of the secure desktop. This reduces the level of security because it potentially exposes the prompts to manipulation by malicious software.

  ### Technical Context
  The rule "UAC Secure Desktop Prompt Disabled" targets potential security weaknesses in the User Account Control (UAC) settings on Windows systems. Specifically, it monitors registry modifications related to the `PromptOnSecureDesktop` value located at `\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`. This setting determines whether UAC prompts appear on the secure desktop, an isolated environment designed to protect against interception by malware. When this value is set to `0` (DWORD: 0x00000000), UAC prompts will instead appear on the user's regular desktop, significantly reducing their effectiveness and exposing them to exploitation.
  Monitoring this configuration change is critical as malicious actors often attempt to alter UAC settings to evade defense mechanisms and escalate privileges. This detection rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques of **Privilege Escalation** (T1548.002) and **Defense Evasion**, as it can be part of an attacker's strategy to circumvent UAC protections.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Utilize your EDR solution to query for recent registry changes, specifically monitoring any modifications to `PromptOnSecureDesktop`. Look for unauthorized or suspicious alterations.
  - **Review Process Access Logs:** Investigate process creation and access events around the time of the registry modifications using Sysmon logs to identify any suspicious processes that manipulated the registry.
  - **Examine User Activity:** Cross-reference the timestamp of the registry change with user activity logs (via Windows Security or EDR) to discern if the change correlates with any potentially malicious actions or unauthorized users.
  - **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Analyze DNS query logs and network connection data for any unusual traffic patterns or external connections that coincide with the registry modification, indicating possible command and control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for significant security implications when UAC protections are weakened, alerts for this rule should be regarded with medium severity. Prompt investigation is necessary to assess whether it indicates a malicious actor's attempt to gain access to higher privileges.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under the following circumstances: if an attacker uses legitimate administrative accounts to change the UAC settings, or if registry access is performed under conditions that do not trigger usual logging (e.g., using tools that operate outside normal auditing procedures). Additionally, environments with restrictive policies preventing direct registry editing may fail to register changes, leading to potential blind spots.

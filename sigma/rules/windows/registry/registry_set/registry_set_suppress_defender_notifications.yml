  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect changes in the Windows Registry that may indicate an attempt to suppress notifications from the Windows Security Center. Specifically, it looks for modifications to the `Notification_Suppress` key within the `SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration` directory, where setting the DWORD value to `1` disables these notifications. By monitoring this registry key, the rule can alert when a user or an attacker seeks to evade security defenses that provide crucial alerts about system security status. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112, which focuses on defense evasion strategies employed by adversaries.
  The data sources involved in this detection include the Windows Registry change logs, which provide insights into changes made to system configurations. Investigating these changes can help determine whether unauthorized alterations have occurred, allowing for a prompt response to potential threats within the enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Utilize a Windows EDR or a management tool to verify the timestamp and user account associated with the modification of the `Notification_Suppress` key. Confirm whether the change aligns with normal administrative activity.
    
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Check the user account's logon history in the Windows Security logs for any suspicious activity. Look for account compromise indicators or unexpected remote access sessions around the time the suppression was activated.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Cross-reference this alert with other security alerts from the SIEM or antivirus logs that may indicate related malicious actions, such as unauthorized access or changes to security settings.
  - **Conduct Threat Hunting:** Engage in proactive threat hunting using network and process monitoring tools (EDR, NDR) to identify unusual patterns or anomalies that could indicate lateral movement or other evasion tactics employed by adversaries.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert indicates a potential attempt to suppress security notifications, it is classified as medium severity. This classification is crucial in an enterprise context, as disabling these notifications could significantly hamper incident detection and response capabilities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the notification suppression is conducted using other methods outside of direct registry modifications, such as group policy updates or through malicious software that modifies registry keys in a less detectable manner. Additionally, if security policies allow certain users or applications to alter configurations without raising alerts, the rule's effectiveness may be diminished. Adversaries who maintain administrative access can also change the registry back to a safe state after performing their actions, thus obscuring their activities.

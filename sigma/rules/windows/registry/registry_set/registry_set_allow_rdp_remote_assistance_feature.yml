  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for "Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature" is designed to identify the enabling of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) feature for specific users on Windows machines, which can be indicative of potential abuse or unauthorized access. The rule specifically focuses on changes made to a particular registry key `fAllowToGetHelp` located at `System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server`. This registry key, when set to `DWORD (0x00000001)`, allows users to connect remotely, which could be exploited by attackers looking to gain unauthorized access. Data sources involved include Windows registry logs, which capture modifications made to system settings and can be monitored effectively for such changes. This correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1112), as unauthorized modifications can be aimed at evading detection mechanisms.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Investigate system logs to determine if the registry value `fAllowToGetHelp` has been modified, noting the user account that made the change and the date/time of the event.
  - **Review User Accounts:** Analyze user and group permissions to verify whether the accounts associated with the change have legitimate access rights or if they appear suspicious based on their role and activity history.
  - **Evaluate RDP Connection Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to review remote connection logs, identifying any unauthorized or anomalous connections made after the registry change was detected.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Logs:** Check related security logs (e.g., Windows Security, Application, and Event Viewer) for unusual patterns or failed login attempts that may indicate attempted exploitation following the RDP feature enablement.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for an unauthorized user to exploit remote desktop access, which could lead to further compromise of the system. The prompt detection and investigation of these alerts are essential to prevent any unauthorized access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Recognized issues for this rule include the possibility of legitimate use cases for enabling RDP, which can result in false positives. The assumption is that all changes are conducted by authorized personnel; however, if an attacker crafts their operations to appear legitimate or if endpoint monitoring is limited, detection may fail. Additionally, environments without strict privilege controls or logging capabilities may not effectively trigger this rule, leading to undetected changes.

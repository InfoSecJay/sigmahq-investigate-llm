  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify when exclusions are added to Windows Defender via registry modifications. Specifically, it focuses on changes made to the registry path located at `\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions`, which can indicate potential attempts to evade detection by malware or unauthorized software. Adding exclusions may allow harmful processes to execute without being detected by Windows Defender, suggesting possible malicious intent. The telemetry data that this rule utilizes primarily comes from Windows Registry logs, specifically targeting settings that pertain to security software configurations. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001), where adversaries may manipulate security settings to bypass defenses.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Activity:** Check the Windows Registry logs for recent changes to the specified path to identify what specific exclusions were added and by whom.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Use EDR tools to analyze user activity during the time of the modification to determine if any suspicious actions were carried out that could correlate with this change.
  - **Analyze Process Activities:** Inspect process creation logs surrounding the time of the registry change to look for any new or unusual processes that may indicate malicious behavior leveraging the newly added exclusions.
  - **Check for Other Anomalies:** Use the SIEM to identify any other related alerts or anomalies within the environment that may indicate a larger compromise, as exclusion settings can often be part of a broader attack strategy.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity because while adding exclusions can be a legitimate administrative action, it can also signify possible malicious intent, particularly when performed outside of normal maintenance windows or by unauthorized users.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the modifications to Windows Defender exclusions are made through methods not tracked by the standard registry change logging or if they are integrated as part of application installations performed by trusted software. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions by system administrators or IT personnel may result in false positives, leading to unnecessary investigations. It is vital to ensure proper access control and logging is in place to reduce these blind spots.

description: Detects registry changes to Microsoft Office "AccessVBOM" to a value
  of "1" which disables trust access for VBA on the victim machine and lets attackers
  execute malicious macros without any Microsoft Office warnings.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors changes to the Windows registry, specifically targeting the "AccessVBOM" key within the Microsoft Office settings. When the value of "AccessVBOM" is set to "1," it disables trust access for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), allowing the execution of potentially malicious macros without standard Microsoft Office warnings. This configuration can be exploited by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms that would usually prevent the execution of harmful scripts. The primary data sources involved in this detection include Windows Event Logs related to registry changes. The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Defense Evasion** and technique **T1112: Modify Registry**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes**: Utilize EDR tools to verify the timestamp and origin of the registry modification for the "AccessVBOM" setting. Assess if the change coincides with any known malicious activities or user error.
  - **Analyze Recent Macro Activity**: Review application logs for Microsoft Office, specifically looking for any macro executions during the same period. Validate whether these macros were executed from untrusted or unexpected documents.
  - **Assess User Workstation Environment**: Gather context about the victim machine, including user permissions and installed applications. Investigate user behavior to determine if they are susceptible to social engineering or phishing attempts that often precede such attacks.
  - **Cross-reference Network Traffic**: Check network logs for any outbound connections made by the affected machine around the time the registry change occurred. Look for any suspicious behavior that may correlate with known indicators of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for unauthorized execution of malicious code through disabled security features in Microsoft Office, which can lead to further compromise of the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule operates under the assumption that no legitimate applications or administrative actions would modify the "AccessVBOM" registry key. However, it may not fire if the registry changes are performed using native or legitimate scripting tools that do not log actions as expected. Additionally, if an attacker uses techniques that obscure their actions (such as rapid modifications or reverting settings), this detection may fail to trigger.

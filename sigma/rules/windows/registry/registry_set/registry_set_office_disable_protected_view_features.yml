  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the disabling of Microsoft Office's Protected View feature through changes to specific registry keys. Protected View is a security mechanism designed to protect users from potentially harmful documents, such as those opened from email attachments or the internet. The rule monitors Windows registry events related to the Protected View feature by checking for modifications in the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office` registry path. It looks for DWORD values that indicate whether Protected View features are enabled (0x00000001) or disabled (0x00000000) for various categories, including attachments from Outlook and files downloaded from the Internet. Adversaries may disable this security feature as part of their tactics to exploit malicious documents, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Security Tools).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Registry Changes:** Use a registry monitoring tool to check the specific changes made to the Protected View registry keys. This may uncover the timeline of modifications and the originating process.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs for any suspicious process creations that may coincide with the registry changes. Look for unusual execution patterns related to Office applications.
  - **Check Security Alerts:** Consult EDR or antivirus logs to identify any related security alerts triggered around the time the registry change occurred. It can highlight any detected threats that may relate to the disabled Protected View.
  - **Inspect User Behavior:** Review user activity logs to determine whether the user associated with the registry change has a legitimate reason for modifying the Protected View settings, or if there's evidence of compromised credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for significant risk; disabling Protected View can expose users to various malicious attacks via compromised documents, increasing the likelihood of a successful breach.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not detect changes made through methods that bypass standard registry modification events, such as direct memory manipulation or tools designed to obscure such modifications. It assumes that relevant logging is enabled and configured correctly; if logging is disabled, the rule may not fire. Furthermore, legitimate administrative changes may result in false positives if not properly contextualized.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential persistence mechanisms via modifications to the Outlook home page settings, specifically targeting Windows registry entries associated with Microsoft Officeâ€™s Outlook application. Attackers may exploit this feature by changing the WebView registry keys to set a malicious home page URL that executes unintended code on Outlook's startup, thereby establishing persistence. The rule highlights changes in the registry entries under the paths associated with Outlook's WebView, particularly those ending with 'URL'. The primary technical data source for this detection is the Windows registry, monitored through the Sysmon tool, and the rule directly aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique [T1112: Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/) under the persistence tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Registry Changes:** Use Sysmon and registry audit logs to review recent changes under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\WebView\` for unexpected entries.
  - **Check User Activity:** Analyze Windows Security logs for unusual login behavior or patterns correlating with the timing of the registry modifications.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Query your EDR for any outbound connections initiated near the time of the registry change, specifically looking for connections to suspicious domains.
  - **Review Installed Add-ins:** Investigate any custom Outlook add-ins or extensions that may have been downloaded or altered around the detected registry change as a potential vector for executing malicious code.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for an attacker to maintain persistent access to the compromised system through Outlook, which is widely used in enterprise environments.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary employs less common methods for persistence that do not involve the modification of the registry. Additionally, if the monitoring for registry changes is not adequately configured or Sysmon is not deployed, this activity will remain undetected. It's also important to recognize that legitimate software updates or configuration changes can inadvertently trigger this alert, leading to potential false positives that require human investigation.

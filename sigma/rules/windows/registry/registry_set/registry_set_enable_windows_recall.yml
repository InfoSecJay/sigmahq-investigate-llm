  Detects the enabling of the Windows Recall feature via registry manipulation. Windows Recall can be enabled by setting the value of "DisableAIDataAnalysis" to "0".
  Adversaries may enable Windows Recall as part of post-exploitation discovery and collection activities.
  This rule assumes that Recall is already explicitly disabled on the host, and subsequently enabled by the adversary.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule focuses on identifying when the Windows Recall feature, a component that facilitates data collection and analysis, is enabled via registry manipulation. Specifically, it tracks changes to the registry value "DisableAIDataAnalysis" under the paths `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI`. When this value is set to `0` (DWORD), it re-enables the Windows Recall feature that is otherwise disabled. This behavior is often employed by adversaries during post-exploitation activities for discovery and information collection. This rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1113: “Screen Capture,” associated with the collection tactic, indicating that the adversary may be attempting to gather sensitive information from the host.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Review the Windows Security Event Logs for registry change events to confirm that the "DisableAIDataAnalysis" value was changed to `0`. Validate the timeline of this change against other activities on the host.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Examine alerts from the EDR solution for any suspicious processes or execution that align with the timing of the registry modification, looking particularly for abnormal usage of tools that might manipulate registry settings.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Utilize log data from user activity to determine if there's any legitimate user action that coincides with the enabling of the Recall feature. Pay close attention to whether administrative privileges were leveraged for the registry changes.
  - **Scan for Related Indicators:** Use network detection tools to identify any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts that correlate with the enabling of the Recall feature, signifying potential data collection by an adversary.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium due to the potential implications of an adversary enabling a feature designed for data analysis, which could lead to the collection of sensitive information without user awareness. This activity could signify deeper compromise and may require immediate investigation to prevent data leakage.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the assumption that the Recall feature was previously disabled. It may not fire if a legitimate administrator re-enables the feature for authorized purposes. Additionally, since it tracks modifications to a specific registry value, it is ineffective against adversaries who may use alternative methods or registry paths to enable the feature, or who might conduct their activities in a manner that avoids detection, such as using stealth tools or techniques to manipulate the registry without raising alerts.

  Detects usage of Windows Input Method Editor (IME) keyboard layout feature, which allows an attacker to load a DLL into the process after sending the WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST message.
  Before doing this, the client needs to register the DLL in a special registry key that is assumed to implement this keyboard layout. This registry key should store a value named "Ime File" with a DLL path.
  IMEs are essential for languages that have more characters than can be represented on a standard keyboard, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects suspicious modifications to the Windows registry related to the Input Method Editor (IME) used for keyboard layouts. Specifically, it looks for any registry entries under the `\Control\Keyboard Layouts\` path that define the "Ime File," which is a DLL path required for executing non-standard keyboard inputs. Attackers can leverage this functionality to load malicious DLLs after sending a `WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST` message, allowing them to bypass certain security mechanisms. Monitoring is performed through registry set logs, specifically targeting variations in the "Ime File" value that are associated with unconventional directories, such as temporary folders or user directories, which could indicate an attempt to conceal malware. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001, which pertains to defense evasion by leveraging system features for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Logs:** Examine recent registry modification logs for entries under `\Control\Keyboard Layouts\` to identify any suspicious "Ime File" paths that do not align with standard configuration.
  - **Check DLL Paths:** Analyze the identified DLL paths to determine if they exist within common directories (e.g., `C:\Windows\`, `C:\Program Files\`) or if they stem from user profile folders or temporary locations, which could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with EDR Events:** Utilize EDR tools to cross-reference any process creation events or DLL loads associated with the suspected registry changes to track execution contexts that could reveal further malicious activity.
  - **Conduct User Activity Analysis:** Investigate any recent user activity across identified user folders for unexpected files or changes, particularly during the time frame surrounding the registry modification noted in initial alerts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity as it potentially signals an advanced and stealthy method of introducing malicious code into an enterprise environment, which could lead to further exploitation or data compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on accurate configuration of registry auditing; if the tracking of these events is not properly enabled, crucial alerts may be missed. Additionally, attackers could attempt to disguise their malicious activity by using legitimate-looking file paths in the registry. The presence of false positives is also acknowledged, as benign applications may legitimately modify the IME settings for functionality or compatibility.

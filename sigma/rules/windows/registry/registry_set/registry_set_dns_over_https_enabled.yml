title: DNS-over-HTTPS Enabled by Registry
id: 04b45a8a-d11d-49e4-9acc-4a1b524407a5
status: test

  Detects when a user enables DNS-over-HTTPS.
  This can be used to hide internet activity or be used to hide the process of exfiltrating data.
  With this enabled organization will lose visibility into data such as query type, response and originating IP that are used to determine bad actors.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect when a user or application enables DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) on Windows systems. DoH is a protocol that encrypts DNS queries, obscuring the details of internet activity such as query type, response, and originating IP address. This can pose a risk to organizations as it may be used to exfiltrate data or evade monitoring by network security solutions. The detection logic focuses on specific registry keys associated with popular browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. It looks for settings that indicate DoH has been enabled, specifically checking for DWORD values in the registry that correspond to these configurations. Given the tactic of "Defense Evasion" (MITRE ATT&CK T1140), unmonitored network activity can allow threat actors to operate unnoticed.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use a registry auditing tool to confirm changes to the relevant keys for Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox to determine the user or process responsible for enabling DoH.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to examine process creation events around the time the registry changes were logged. Look for any unusual or unauthorized applications that might have modified these settings.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Investigate network logs using NDR or NGFW to assess any unusual or encrypted DNS queries for indications of data exfiltration or C2 communication associated with DoH.
  - **Inspect User Activity:** Retrieve user activity logs from the environment to ascertain whether legitimate users were involved in enabling DoH or if it was initiated by a potentially malicious actor or automated process.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is deemed of medium severity as enabling DNS-over-HTTPS can significantly reduce visibility into malicious activities. While detection is essential, not all instances may indicate a compromise, necessitating context during analysis.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in certain scenarios, such as if the registry changes were made through scripts or by an administrator who has a legitimate reason for enabling DoH. Furthermore, certain environments may utilize policies or group settings that enforce DoH without triggering this rule. The absence of telemetry from all browsers in use could also result in missed detections, as this rule specifically targets only the identified browsers.

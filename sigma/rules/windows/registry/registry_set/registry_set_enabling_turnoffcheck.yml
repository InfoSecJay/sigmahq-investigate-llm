  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify modifications to the Windows Registry, specifically targeting the setting that controls the "TurnOffCheck" option within the Scripted Diagnostics feature. When this setting is enabled (set to `DWORD (0x00000001)`), it can bypass critical security features related to the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), particularly in relation to the exploited Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190). By monitoring registry changes, the rule utilizes data from Windows Security event logs where Registry key modifications are logged. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion," more specifically the technique T1562.001, which emphasizes ways adversaries attempt to avoid detection and manipulate system behavior to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Recent Registry Changes:** Check Windows Security event logs for the specific registry path `\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\ScriptedDiagnostics\TurnOffCheck` and verify if the `DWORD` value has been altered recently by unauthorized processes.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Creation Logs:** Look into process creation logs to identify if any suspicious or anomalous processes initiated around the time of the registry change, focusing on the parent-child relationships that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Assess the Impacted Systems:** Use EDR tools to determine whether the affected systems have exhibited any unusual behavior or network activity following the registry modification, including connection attempts to known malicious domains or IP addresses.
  - **Validate Threat Actor Capability:** Investigate the execution context (user account, permissions) under which the registry modification occurred. Ensure that it was not triggered by legitimate administrative actions, reviewing recent administrator logins and activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for attackers to exploit the bypassed MSDT safeguards, which could lead to further compromise or lateral movement within the enterprise. Timely investigation is essential to mitigate risks associated with this vulnerability.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry change is performed through methods not logged in standard Windows logs (e.g., utilizing non-standard tools or malware that evades detection). Additionally, legitimate administrative actions could trigger false positives, leading to unnecessary investigations. Engineers should be aware that not all changes to the registry will be captured if logging is misconfigured or if changes are made in a rapid sequence, which can result in missed detections.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Potential Persistence Via TypedPaths" is designed to detect unauthorized modifications made to the Windows registry, specifically targeting the `TypedPaths` key in the `\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\` folder. These keys store user input data related to the paths entered in Windows Explorer, and if an unknown or non-standard application modifies them, it may indicate an attempt at persistence by an adversary to maintain access or achieve other malicious outcomes. The detection relies on monitoring registry set events where the target object contains the specified registry path, ensuring that the modification is attributed to non-standard applications and not to legitimate instances of Windows Explorer (specifically `explorer.exe`). This rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence, specifically under the technique of modifying registry settings for persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Review the registry modifications of the `TypedPaths` key to identify which applications have made changes and collect details about the new entries.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Utilize EDR tools to track the processes that executed around the time of the registry change, focusing on any non-standard applications or behaviors that were not previously observed.
  - **Audit User Activity:** Investigate the user's activity log in connection with the changes to determine if the modifications align with normal usage patterns or if they appear malicious.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Use network logs from firewalls or proxies to identify any unusual outbound connections made by the process responsible for the registry change, which may indicate data exfiltration or command and control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated by this rule are considered high severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized persistence mechanisms, which can lead to further compromise and long-term access to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where attackers utilize legitimate applications that are not captured by the defined filters, or if the persistence mechanism employs alternative registry keys that are not monitored. Additionally, users with administrative privileges might interact with the `TypedPaths` key during normal operations, which could result in false negatives if changes are made under legitimate circumstances. It assumes that alterations are universally unrecognized as "non-standard," which may not always hold true in a diverse enterprise software landscape.

title: Winlogon AllowMultipleTSSessions Enable
id: f7997770-92c3-4ec9-b112-774c4ef96f96
status: test
description: |
  Detects when the 'AllowMultipleTSSessions' value is enabled.
  Which allows for multiple Remote Desktop connection sessions to be opened at once.
  This is often used by attacker as a way to connect to an RDP session without disconnecting the other users

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Winlogon AllowMultipleTSSessions Enable" is designed to identify instances where the registry setting `AllowMultipleTSSessions` is enabled in the Windows operating system. This specific registry key, located at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`, controls the ability to establish multiple Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions on a single machine simultaneously. When an attacker seeks to gain unauthorized access to a system, they may leverage the ability to connect through RDP without disrupting existing sessions, making this configuration a potential avenue for persistence and evasion tactics. The detection focuses on registry modification logs from Windows, specifically tracking changes where the `AllowMultipleTSSessions` value is set to `DWORD (0x00000001)`. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Persistence (T1112) and Defense Evasion (T1112) as it can facilitate covert access to a machine while maintaining existing user connections.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Modifications**: Use a Registry monitoring tool or EDR solution to verify when the `AllowMultipleTSSessions` value was last changed and by which user or process.
    
  - **Examine RDP Logs**: Review Windows RDP connection logs (Terminal Services logs) to identify any unusual or unauthorized RDP session connections that may coincide with the registry change.
    
  - **Assess User Activity**: Investigate user accounts that initiated RDP sessions around the time the registry change occurred. Look for accounts exhibiting suspicious or anomalies in typical behavior.
    
  - **Confirm Legitimate Use**: Ensure that the enabling of multiple RDP sessions aligns with intended organizational policies and workflows. If necessary, consult with IT operations or management for confirmation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is rated as medium severity due to the potential that enabling multiple RDP sessions can facilitate unauthorized access and privilege escalation, making it an essential investigation point in securing enterprise environments.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry change is performed by legitimate administrative actions during scheduled maintenance or other authorized configurations. Furthermore, unusual methods to modify registry settings, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in granted permissions or use of scripts, may evade detection. Itâ€™s also crucial to note that if an attacker uses malware that restores this setting back to its default state after making changes, detection will falter.

title: Potential AMSI COM Server Hijacking
id: 160d2780-31f7-4922-8b3a-efce30e63e96
status: test
description: Detects changes to the AMSI come server registry key in order disable
  AMSI scanning functionalities. When AMSI attempts to starts its COM component, it
  will query its registered CLSID and return a non-existent COM server. This causes
  a load failure and prevents any scanning methods from being accessed, ultimately
  rendering AMSI useless

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potential hijacking of the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) COM server through unauthorized modifications to its registry keys. Specifically, it looks for changes made to the registry key corresponding to the CLSID of the AMSI COM serverâ€”`{fdb00e52-a214-4aa1-8fba-4357bb0072ec}`. When an adversary alters this registry key, it directs AMSI to use a non-existent COM server, which will lead to a failure in loading the actual AMSI scanning functionalities. This constitutes an evasion technique as detailed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Defense Evasion" tactic (Tactic ID: T1562.001). By monitoring registry modifications in Windows, particularly those targeting the AMSI-related CLSID, this rule helps to identify potentially malicious activities that aim to disable antimalware defenses.
  The log source for this detection is specifically the Windows registry set activity, where the rule watches for changes that end with the designated CLSID string. The filter further restricts the results to entries directing to the system's legitimate AMSI DLL file, ensuring that only suspicious modifications triggering evasion are flagged. This combination of logging and filtering enhances the accuracy of the detections while maintaining an effective posture against threats aimed at disabling security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Check the Windows Registry for modifications to the target CLSID path to confirm if unauthorized changes have been made recently and identify the user or process that made the changes.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze any related process creation and execution leading to the time of the registry change. Look for processes that may have spawned from unusual or untrusted sources.
  - **Examine Event Logs:** Inspect Windows Event Logs, particularly the Security and Sysmon logs, for unusual activity correlating with the timestamps of the registry modifications, which may reveal lateral movement or exploitation attempts.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference the identification of anomalous activities with threat intelligence databases and reports to determine if known adversarial tactics, techniques, or procedures (TTPs) are being utilized.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert indicates a high level of severity, it suggests a critical potential for an adversary to disable key security features. In a corporate environment, this could fundamentally compromise the organization's defenses against malware and other malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under certain circumstances, such as if an adversary uses more sophisticated methods to alter registry keys without following straightforward patterns that this rule intends to capture. Additionally, legitimate applications or authorized users might trigger similar registry changes, resulting in false positives. The detection may also fail if the AMSI component itself is not present, if there are non-standard configurations, or if monitoring of specific registry paths is disabled. Furthermore, it assumes the monitoring of relevant Windows logs is intact and operational.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential persistence mechanisms that leverage Microsoft Excel. Specifically, the rule identifies the creation of a registry key that configures Excel to load an add-in (with the extension `.xll`) automatically upon startup. The rule inspects Windows registry logs to find keys in the `Software\Microsoft\Office\Excel\Options` path, looking for entries that start with `/R`, which is an indicator that the system will run the specified Excel add-in. The detection is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Persistence," specifically technique T1137.006, which focuses on the use of Office add-ins for persistence.
  The telemetry for this rule primarily comes from Windows Registry logs, which capture changes to registry keys and values. Successful detections can indicate an attacker attempting to establish persistence on an affected host by ensuring their malicious add-in executes every time Excel is launched.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the endpoint detection and response logs for any abnormal activity around Excel processes post-registry change, particularly looking for unexpected command-line arguments or unusual process behaviors associated with the Excel application.
    
  - **Examine Registry Changes:** Access the Windows Registry on the impacted host and navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Excel\Options`. Verify any recent changes to keys and values, specifically those that include `/R` and end with `.xll`.
    
  - **Analyze Execution History:** Utilize application logs or telemetry from Windows to analyze the execution frequency of the detected Excel add-in. Cross-check for any anomalies in user behavior during periods when the add-in was active.
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Review network connection logs for unusual outbound traffic patterns or connections made during or right after the execution of Excel, which may indicate communications with a command-and-control server.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level assigned to this alert, it indicates a significant risk of an attacker gaining prolonged access to an enterprise environment. Excel add-ins can serve as persistent backdoors, which can lead to further compromises or data exfiltration if left unchecked.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses alternative persistence mechanisms that do not involve the specific registry paths or formats defined in the rule. Additionally, if Excel add-ins are already legitimate and well-established within the environment, there could be many false positives. The detection may also be bypassed by sophisticated adversaries who modify their payloads to avoid detection or use non-Excel methods for persistence, thereby avoiding the targeted registry keys.

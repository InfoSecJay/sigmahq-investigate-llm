  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential tampering attempts with Sophos Antivirus (AV) registry keys that control essential functionality, specifically tamper protection features. The rule focuses on monitoring registry changes related to specific keys associated with Sophos Endpoint Defense, namely `SAVEnabled`, `SEDEnabled`, and other related settings that can interfere with tamper protection capabilities. By signaling a modification where these keys are set to `DWORD (0x00000000)`, the rule seeks to detect unauthorized attempts to disable or alter protections that might permit an adversary to bypass security controls. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics involved are "Defense Evasion" under the technique T1562.001, which highlights adversaries' efforts to disable security software to facilitate their operations undetected.
  The primary data source for this detection rule is the Windows Registry, specifically monitoring the actions performed on the keys related to Sophos AV. This method is vital as attackers often seek to manipulate registry settings to disable security features, making it an essential monitoring point for SOC analysts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Modifications:** Examine the Windows Registry logs for changes made to the mentioned Sophos AV keys right before the alert was triggered, looking for unusual modifications that may not align with documented administrative practices.
    
  - **Evaluate Process Activities:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the process tree and identify any processes that may have attempted to access or modify the registry keys associated with the tamper protection settings.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Investigate user account activities leading up to the alert using Windows Security logs; look for any suspicious logins or administrative actions that may correlate with the time of the detected registry change.
  - **Cross-reference AV Logs:** Check the Sophos AV logs to validate if the tamper protection feature was legitimately disabled or manipulated for routine patching or maintenance operations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert warrants a high severity level due to the critical nature of tamper protection in security frameworks. If an adversary successfully disables Sophos AV protections through registry manipulation, it significantly increases the risk of further malicious activity within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Some potential blind spots include legitimate actions taken by system administrators for maintenance or configuration changes that may not be documented thoroughly. Additionally, if the Sophos AV itself disables these settings for legitimate reasons, it could trigger false positives. Assumptions made in this rule include that all tampering attempts are unauthorized, which may not account for existing internal policies or automated system processes that alter these settings. This necessitates thorough context checks before classifying any activity as malicious.

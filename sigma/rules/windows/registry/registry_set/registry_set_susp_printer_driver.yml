  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious printer driver installations in Windows operating systems where the manufacturer value is empty. Specifically, it monitors the Windows Registry for entries related to printer drivers, focusing on the paths associated with printer environments and driver installations. The rule checks for registry entries indicating that a new printer driver has been installed under `\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Drivers` that lacks a specified manufacturer name. An empty manufacturer field can often indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities, such as privilege escalation. This detection is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Privilege Escalation** (Tactic: `TA0004`, Technique: `T1574`).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use Windows event logs or EDR tools to list recent registry changes, particularly those pertaining to printer driver installations, to confirm the empty manufacturer value.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Check endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify any processes that initiated the registry modifications, focusing on unusual or unauthorized processes running around the same timestamp.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Investigate any network connections made by the identified processes to assess if they are communicating with known malicious IPs or domains, which may indicate further compromise.
  - **Inspect Related Logs:** Examine System and Application event logs to identify any other anomalous behavior associated with the printer driver installations, such as user account changes or other configuration modifications.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level assigned to this alert, it is critical to treat alerts related to suspicious printer driver installations as potentially serious threats, as they may provide an attacker with a foothold for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate printer drivers are installed that do not include specific manufacturer details, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, if an adversary uses a legitimate printer driver with valid manufacturer details to cover their tracks, the rule may fail to detect malicious activity. It is also assumed that the monitored systems are configured to log registry changes appropriately; if registry logging is disabled, this detection will not be effective.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential AutoLogger Sessions Tampering" Sigma rule is designed to detect attempts by threat actors to tamper with auto logger trace sessions in Windows. These trace sessions are crucial for logging Windows events and can be manipulated to disable logging, which is a key tactic in covering up malicious activities. This rule looks for changes in the Windows registry that indicate configuration modifications to autologger sessions, specifically within the path `\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\`. It checks for specific keys related to event logging, such as `\EventLog-` and `\Defender`, and identifies if these are being disabled by monitoring for changes where a DWORD value is set to `0x00000000` for critical settings like `\Enable` and `\Start`. This threat is related to the MITRE ATT&CK technique of **Defense Evasion**, which represents adversary attempts to avoid detection and logging of their actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Examine registry entries under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\` for value changes that correspond with the alert, focusing on keys associated with event logging.
  - **Correlate Process Activity:** Use EDR tools to correlate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` during the times when related registry modifications were detected, identifying any nefarious activity or processes.
  - **Analyze System Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application) for events indicating the execution of process commands or access modifications that could relate to tampering with logging mechanisms.
  - **Network and Proxy Analysis:** Check network logs and proxy server traffic to spot any unusual outbound connections from systems where tampering was detected, which could indicate data exfiltration or further malicious actions.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is prioritized as high due to the severe implications of disabling logging mechanisms, which can allow attackers to evade detection and persist within a compromised environment without being noticed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There may be blind spots in the rule related to legitimate changes made by system administrators that could result in false positives or benign modifications to autologger settings. Additionally, the rule assumes comprehensive monitoring of registry changes; if endpoint protection or logging layers are disabled or misconfigured, the rule may fail to trigger. Attackers can also use alternative methods or less common tools to manipulate logging that this detection might not account for.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential COM hijacking attempts via the manipulation of the Windows registry, specifically targeting the "TreatAs" registry key associated with COM objects. By altering this key, an attacker can redirect legitimate COM object calls to malicious payloads, which can be executed using commands such as `rundll32.exe -sta`. The rule inspects registry modifications where the `TargetObject` ends with `TreatAs\(Default)`, indicating a modification that could be leveraged for persistence and code execution. The primary data sources involved in this detection are Windows Registry logs, which are critical for identifying unauthorized changes within the systemâ€™s configuration. This rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Persistence" and technique T1546.015.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes**: Utilize Windows Security Event Logs and Registry auditing tools to examine recent changes to the `TreatAs` key and any associated COM objects.
  - **Analyze Process Activity**: Check the EDR for any instances of `rundll32.exe` running with the `-sta` argument in conjunction with the detected registry changes.
  - **Monitor Parent Processes**: Investigate the parent process of any suspicious `svchost.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, or any other relevant executables to determine if they were involved in a process creation event that initiated the registry modification.
  - **Check for False Positives**: Assess the context of the modifications by verifying against known legitimate installations or updates, particularly for Office Click-to-Run and MSI execution to rule out legitimate operations.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the medium severity level of this alert, it indicates a moderate threat to the environment, as while COM hijacking can lead to significant impact, it often requires additional factors to be exploited effectively. Responders should prioritize immediate investigation to ascertain the context of the detected changes and determine if additional compromise indicators exist.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may miss detections if the modifications to the "TreatAs" key are performed by processes that are not `svchost.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, or Office-related binaries. Additionally, legitimate applications may also modify this key during updates or installations, which can lead to false positives. Any registry changes made through administrative scripts not captured in logs will also evade detection. Therefore, other engineers should consider the operational environment's characteristics and potential misuse cases that could bypass this rule.

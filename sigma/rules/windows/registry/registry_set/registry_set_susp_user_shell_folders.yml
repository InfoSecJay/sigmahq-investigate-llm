  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value" aims to identify potentially malicious alterations to the Windows Registry, specifically targeting the User Shell Folders, where the Startup value can be modified. By monitoring changes to the registry key located at `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders`, security teams can detect if an unauthorized path is set which may serve as a launching point for malware on system startup. This modification is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1547.001 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder), within the tactics of persistence and privilege escalation. This behavior is predominantly captured through Windows registry events, providing visibility into malicious attempts focused on achieving persistence in a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use tools like Sysinternals Suite or PowerShell to check the specific registry key modifications made around the time of the alert. Look for any unusual or unknown paths being set in the Startup value.
  - **Check for Associated Malware:** Utilize EDR solutions to perform a comprehensive scan for known malware signatures or behavioral patterns linked to the modified registry entries. Prioritize any suspicious files that may be tied to the new startup path.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Inspect process creation logs using Sysmon or your EDR to determine if any processes launched from the registered path were seen recently. Pay attention to execution context to identify any rogue processes.
  - **Examine User Activity:** Review logs from your SIEM and user access logs to identify any suspicious or unauthorized user accounts that may correlate with the modification event. Ensure that proper user access controls are in place.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to its potential association with persistent threats, where an adversary could leverage the registry modification to establish a foothold and execute payloads on system startup.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several assumptions associated with this rule. Firstly, it presumes that the telemetry capturing registry changes is properly configured and that no mechanisms are in place to obfuscate the changes made by adversaries. Additionally, legitimate applications may also modify startup paths, leading to potential false positives. The rule may not fire if the modifications bypass monitoring due to advanced evasion tactics or if the alerting system experiences configuration errors or limitations in scope.

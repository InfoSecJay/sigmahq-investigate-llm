  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the creation of new file associations specifically targeting the executable file handler (`exefile`). It looks for registry keys being set that modify how Windows handles file extensions, which can be a tactic used by adversaries to bypass security measures. Specifically, it searches for registry keys under "Classes" containing `exefile`, indicating that an attacker is attempting to change the default program associated with executable files. By altering these associations, malicious actors can manipulate how executable files are run, potentially allowing them to execute harmful payloads without triggering security alerts. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Defense Evasion (T1203), as it helps attackers evade detection by masking their malicious actions under legitimate file types.
  The primary data source used for this detection rule is the Windows Registry, where file associations are defined. By monitoring the `registry_set` event type, this rule can efficiently capture unauthorized modifications that may indicate an ongoing compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Recent Registry Changes:** Utilize EDR or Sysmon to review recent registry changes and identify any abnormalities related to the `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` or similar paths that might be susceptible to unauthorized modifications.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Investigate process creation logs for any suspicious executables tied to the altered file associations, cross-referencing them with the timestamps of the registry modifications.
  - **Evaluate Security Product Alerts:** Review alerts or logs from endpoint security solutions that may indicate attempted execution of malicious files associated with modified handlers.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Check for user activities or anomalies that may correlate with the time of registry changes, which could provide context on whether changes were legitimate or part of an attack.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert identifies potential registry manipulation that can lead to executing malicious code, it is classified as a high severity alert. In an enterprise environment, such modifications could reflect an urgent need for investigation to determine the presence of an ongoing compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses non-standard methods to change file associations or if they utilize tools that directly manipulate file types without modifying the registry in the expected manner. Additionally, if an organization has legitimate applications or scripts that alter file associations, these could generate false positives. Understanding the common behaviors and legitimate use cases in your specific environment is vital for tuning this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Enable Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange" focuses on detecting unauthorized changes to registry settings that enable the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol in Microsoft Word and Excel. DDE is a protocol used for inter-application communication that can be abused by adversaries to execute malicious code. The rule specifically monitors the Windows registry for settings related to DDE: the presence of `DWORD (0x00000001)` or `DWORD (0x00000002)` under the `\Word\Security\AllowDDE` key, and `DWORD (0x00000000)` under the `\Excel\Security\DisableDDEServerLaunch` or `\Excel\Security\DisableDDEServerLookup` keys. By alerting on these changes, the rule helps identify potential attempts to execute code via DDE, which is relevant to MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Execution, particularly technique T1559.002 (Dynamic Data Exchange).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Utilize a Windows Event Log tool or registry monitoring capability to examine recent changes to the registry keys associated with DDE in both Word and Excel. Confirm the user account making these changes and the date/time they occurred.
    
  - **Review User Activity:** Investigate the user's behavior using EDR tools to identify any potentially malicious activity or file executions that coincide with the DDE configuration change. Correlate this with any recent alerts that may indicate malicious activity.
  - **Analyze Document Files:** Use a file analysis tool to inspect any Word or Excel documents that were recently opened or modified by the user in question. Look for unexpected macros or embedded links that may exploit DDE.
  - **Network Traffic Review:** Use NDR capabilities to assess any network connections established shortly after the registry changes were observed. Pay attention to connections originating from Office applications that may indicate communication with malicious external servers.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity as enabling DDE can significantly increase the risk of malware execution through document-based methods. While not all DDE use is malicious, the presence of this configuration change warrants further investigation to mitigate potential risks to the organization.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that DDE is not legitimately required in the environment and that any enabling of this feature should be treated with caution. One potential blind spot is if multiple users make the same configuration change in a legitimate context, leading to challenges in attribution. Additionally, attackers may employ techniques to revert or obfuscate registry changes, allowing them to bypass detection.

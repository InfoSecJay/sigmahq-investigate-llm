  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential bypass attempts of User Account Control (UAC) using Event Viewer, a well-known tactic employed by malicious actors to escalate privileges on Windows systems. The rule specifically monitors the Windows Registry for modifications that target command objects associated with `.msc` (Microsoft Management Console) files, enabling adversaries to execute malicious code with elevated privileges. By searching for instances where the `TargetObject` ends with `'_Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command\(Default)'`, it focuses on Registry entries that specify the command executed when a specific file type is opened. The `filter` condition ensures that only anomalous entries are flagged, specifically those that deviate from the expected execution path, which typically points to the legitimate `mmc.exe` process in the system root directory. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence and the technique T1547.010 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder), highlighting how attackers may employ legitimate system components for nefarious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Examine the Windows Registry and search for changes to the specified path (`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mscfile\shell\open\command`) to determine if unauthorized alterations have occurred.
  - **Check Event Logs:** Utilize Windows Event Logs (specifically Security logs) to investigate any processes that were executed in relation to the modified command, looking for logins or other activities around the same timeframe.
  - **Analyze Process Execution:** Use your EDR tool to investigate the execution history of `mmc.exe` and any sibling processes that may have spawned from the suspicious command to identify potential malicious payloads or behaviors.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Review user activity logs to ascertain if the user account linked to the UAC bypass attempt has unusual access patterns or a history of privilege escalation attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the significant risk associated with unauthorized privilege escalation, which can lead to further exploitation, data breaches, or the deployment of advanced malware within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in environments where alternative methods of access control or registry configurations are in place, potentially allowing a bypass without modifying the specified Registry entry. Additionally, false negatives may occur if the targeted process or command does not match the specified parameters. It's also possible that a skilled adversary may use more sophisticated means to hide the UAC bypass action, such as leveraging Process Hollowing or other evasion techniques.

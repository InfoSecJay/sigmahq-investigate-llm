  ### Technical Context
  The **Potential PSFactoryBuffer COM Hijacking** detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious changes to the Windows registry, specifically the entry for the PSFactory COM object associated with the CLSID `{c90250f3-4d7d-4991-9b69-a5c5bc1c2ae6}`. This registry path plays a crucial role in Windows COM (Component Object Model) functionality, where the `InProcServer32` key determines the dynamic link library (DLL) that gets loaded during COM calls. Adversaries can exploit this by altering this entry to point to a malicious DLL, creating persistence mechanisms that can remain undetected. The rule focuses on registry modifications where the target object ends with the specified CLSID and filters out benign alterations referencing a known system DLL (`ActXPrxy.dll`). This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic **Persistence** (T1546.015), which identifies the mechanism utilized by malware to maintain control over a system even after reboots or user sessions are terminated.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Registry Changes:** Review the event logs for any recent modifications to the `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{c90250f3-4d7d-4991-9b69-a5c5bc1c2ae6}\InProcServer32` key using Windows Registry Editor or PowerShell commands.
  - **Search for Malicious DLLs:** Utilize EDR tools to check for the presence of any non-standard or suspicious DLL files tied to the registry entry, particularly in the context of the file path modification.
  - **Correlate with Endpoint Activity:** Examine endpoint activity logs (such as process creation events) to identify any processes that accessed the modified COM object or executed after the registry change, focusing on unusual parent-child process relationships.
  - **Review User and System Behavior:** Analyze logs from systems affected by the alert to track user behavior around the time of the modification, including unusual PowerShell commands or script activity that may have laid the groundwork for the registry change.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it indicates a strong likelihood of malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence on the endpoint. Immediate investigation is critical; if this is related to a confirmed threat actor's behavior, it could lead to further network-wide impacts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that adversaries will alter the registry key in a typical manner without obfuscation or advanced anti-detection techniques. It may not fire if adversaries use alternate techniques to achieve persistence or if they leverage legitimate tools and processes that do not alter the monitored registry keys. Additionally, the rule relies on timely logging of registry changes, so any delays or failures in logging may prevent effective detection.

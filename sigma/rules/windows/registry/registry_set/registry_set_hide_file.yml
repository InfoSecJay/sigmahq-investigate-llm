  Detects modifications to the "Hidden" and "ShowSuperHidden" explorer registry values in order to disable showing of hidden files and system files.
  This technique is abused by several malware families to hide their files from normal users.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies unauthorized changes to registry settings that control the visibility of hidden files and system files in Windows Explorer. Specifically, it monitors modifications to the "Hidden" and "ShowSuperHidden" values within the Windows registry, which are found under the path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`. Malware often manipulates these settings to hide malicious files from users, facilitating undetected persistence and evasion of security tools. When the rule detects a change where these values are set to `DWORD (0x00000000)`, it triggers an alert that indicates a potential threat.
  The primary technical data sources for this detection include Windows registry set logs, which provide visibility into changes made to crucial system settings. By focusing on these specific registry keys, security teams can spot behavior consistent with known tactics used by various malware families.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the identified registry changes using EDR tools to observe the time, user, and associated processes that triggered the modification.
  - Cross-reference with process creation logs to determine if any suspicious activities or applications were running at the time the registry values were modified.
  - Analyze command-line executions associated with the process to identify potential malicious arguments or behaviors that could indicate a payload attempting to hide itself.
  - Consult AV and threat intelligence sources to check for known signatures or behaviors linked to the identified changes, assessing whether any malware families are associated with similar actions.

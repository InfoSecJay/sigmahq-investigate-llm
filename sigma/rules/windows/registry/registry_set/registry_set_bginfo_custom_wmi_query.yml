  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for changes in the Windows registry that relate to the configuration of BgInfo, a tool often used for displaying system information on the desktop. Specifically, the rule focuses on registry values under the path `\Software\Winternals\BGInfo\UserFields\`, which can be manipulated to execute custom Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries via the BgInfo.exe process. By detecting the setting of a new registry value within this context, organizations can be alerted to potential misuse, as attackers may leverage BgInfo to perform reconnaissance or carry out other nefarious activities while evading detection. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactic of Defense Evasion (TA0060), technique T1112 (Adjust Device or Application Control Policies).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use a registry monitoring tool or EDR to check for the specified event within the registry at `\Software\Winternals\BGInfo\UserFields\`. Determine if the change corresponds with any known good or legitimate usage patterns of BgInfo.
    
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Investigate EDR logs for any associated process activity pertaining to BgInfo.exe around the time of the registry modification. Look for suspicious command-line arguments that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Check WMI Execution Logs:** Utilize Windows Event Logs and the Sysmon tool to track any recent WMI queries executed by BgInfo.exe. Correlate this data with the registry modification to determine any unusual or unauthorized executions.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Utilize network detection tools to monitor outbound connections made by the host running BgInfo.exe post-registry change. Identify any unusual or unauthorized data exfiltration attempts or connections to known malicious IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for an attacker to exploit BgInfo for executing custom WMI queries, which may indicate preparation for further malicious actions such as data exfiltration or environment probing. As a result, alerts should be investigated promptly, but they may not represent an immediate threat.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on monitoring registry changes and does not account for scenarios where attackers may utilize legitimate schedulers or invoke BgInfo in a different context that does not trigger the specified registry change. Additionally, if the system employs Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that automate legitimate changes to these registry settings, the rule may produce false positives. Moreover, it assumes that the logging configurations are properly set to capture relevant registry activity and that Sysmon is deployed effectively to monitor WMI activity.

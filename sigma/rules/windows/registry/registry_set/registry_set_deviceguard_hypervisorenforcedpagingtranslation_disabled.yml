  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Hypervisor Enforced Paging Translation Disabled" detects changes to the Windows registry value that controls the Hypervisor Enforced Paging Translation feature. Specifically, it alerts when the registry key `DisableHypervisorEnforcedPagingTranslation` is set to `1`, indicating that the protection mechanism is being disabled. Hypervisor Enforced Paging Translation is a critical security feature designed to reduce the risk of kernel exploits by enforcing strict memory management policies. 
  The rule leverages registry audit logs as its primary data source and utilizes the Windows Security event logs related to registry modifications. The technical context for this detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001). By monitoring this specific registry change, security teams can identify potential evasion techniques being employed by adversaries aiming to bypass security mechanisms.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Registry Change:** Use Windows registry tools or PowerShell to verify the current value of `DisableHypervisorEnforcedPagingTranslation` and confirm if it has been set to `1`.
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check Windows Security event logs for `Event ID 4657` which tracks changes to registry values, to assess the source and context of the modification.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Investigate endpoint data from the EDR to identify any associated processes or applications that were running during the time of the registry change.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Examine Proxy, VPN, and other relevant user activity logs to ascertain whether the account that made the change has a legitimate purpose or if it appears suspicious.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because disabling Hypervisor Enforced Paging Translation could indicate an attempt to weaken system defenses against kernel-level exploits. Such actions can expose the enterprise to significant risks and potential compromise of critical assets.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized issue is that legitimate system administrators may change the registry value for troubleshooting or specific applications, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes techniques that obfuscate or revert registry changes, this rule may fail to trigger. The rule may also not fire if auditing for registry changes is not enabled, or if changes are made in a manner that circumvents standard monitoring tools.

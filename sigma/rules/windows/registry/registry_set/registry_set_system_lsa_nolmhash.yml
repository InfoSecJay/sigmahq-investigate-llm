  Detects changes to the "NoLMHash" registry value in order to allow Windows to store LM Hashes.
  By setting this registry value to "0" (DWORD), Windows will be allowed to store a LAN manager hash of your password in Active Directory and local SAM databases.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Enable LM Hash Storage" Sigma rule is designed to detect changes made to the Windows registry value for "NoLMHash" located at `System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\NoLMHash`. When this registry value is set to `0` (DWORD), it enables the storage of LAN Manager (LM) Hashes, which are considered insecure and can lead to a higher risk of user credential compromise. By monitoring for such changes, the rule aims to alert security analysts when potentially unauthorized configurations that enable LM Hash storage are applied. This detection utilizes Windows registry logs as its primary data source, specifically looking for modifications that could indicate an attempt at evading security mechanisms under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactic of defense evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Change Source:** Utilize EDR tools to identify which user or process initiated the registry change, focusing on process creation logs around the time of the event.
  - **Check User Permissions:** Investigate user permissions related to the accounts that made changes to the "NoLMHash" setting by reviewing Windows Security logs to ensure that unauthorized or compromised accounts are not involved.
  - **Analyze Other Related Registry Keys:** Look into other security-related registry keys within the same path or context, to assess if there were additional changes made that could indicate a broader security breach.
  - **Review Account Authentication Methods:** Inspect logon attempts and authentication methods being used on affected systems, using logs from Active Directory to confirm if any changes in authentication patterns exist.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that enabling LM Hash storage can expose sensitive credentials to interception, the alert is classified as high severity. The potential for credential theft and subsequent lateral movement within the network makes timely investigation critical to prevent unauthorized access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if changes to the NoLMHash value are made through scripts that do not log typical user actions or if users exploit local administrative privileges to modify registry settings without proper auditing. Additionally, situations where administrative users respect security practices and do not alter this setting could lead to silent failures in detection. Other evasion tactics, such as making changes through non-standard registry paths or through external tools that bypass Windows Event logging, may also result in missed detection.

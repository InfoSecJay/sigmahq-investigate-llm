  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying unauthorized changes to specific Windows registry keys associated with service configurations, particularly targeting the Windows Error Reporting service (wercplsupport). The rule is designed to catch behaviors consistent with the Blue Mockingbird threat actor, known for exploiting misconfigurations and leveraging cryptomining techniques. When the rule is triggered, it indicates an attempt to modify the `ServiceDll` parameter in the specified registry path, which can be indicative of persistence mechanisms or malicious payloads being installed on the system.
  The primary technical data source for this rule is Windows Registry change logs, specifically monitoring for entries set on `Parameters\ServiceDll` within the `CurrentControlSet\Services\wercplsupport` path. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1112 (Modification of Registry) and T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation), which describes various techniques attackers may utilize to manipulate Windows system configurations. Incident responders should pay close attention to the context of these changes to identify potential security incidents swiftly.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Activity:** Utilize the Windows Registry log to verify if there were unauthorized changes made to the `wercplsupport` service parameters. Document any unexpected entries or modifications.
  - **Examine EDR Alerts:** Review EDR logs for any associated suspicious processes that may have initiated the registry change. Look for recent process creations or command-line arguments that might correspond to the alert.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Inspect network logs (NDR or firewall) for any unusual outbound connections or communication patterns that occurred around the time of the alert, suggesting potential command and control communication.
  - **Review System Integrity:** Conduct a health check of the involved system to verify that no additional malware, such as cryptominers, has been deployed following the registry change. This can involve scanning for known malicious signatures or unusual resource consumption patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of the registry modifications and their potential impact on system integrity and security, this alert should be treated with high severity in an enterprise environment. Unauthorized changes can lead to persistence mechanisms, allowing threat actors to maintain control over a compromised system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in scenarios where auditing is not enabled for the Windows Registry or if changes occur in rapid succession, potentially overwhelming logging mechanisms. Additionally, advanced adversaries might utilize legitimate processes or tools to carry out modifications stealthily, resulting in false negatives. Incident responders should be aware that defensive mechanisms, such as whitelisting or trusted binary usage, may obscure malicious actions, complicating detection efforts.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors changes to the Windows registry, specifically targeting the `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NetSh` key. The Netsh helper DLL is a legitimate component of the Windows operating system that can be manipulated by attackers to establish persistence on compromised systems. By adding a new value that points to a malicious DLL, adversaries can ensure that their payload is executed by the system during network-related tasks. This behavior is classified under the MITRE ATT&CK framework as T1546.007, indicating a persistence technique via the use of DLLs associated with network configuration tools.
  To identify potential threats, this rule inspects registry changes to detect new entries that include DLL extensions within the specified Netsh registry path. It leverages telemetry from Windows registry modifications, which grants visibility into attempts by adversaries to subvert legitimate system configurations for their own ends.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Recent Registry Changes:** Review the Windows registry for recent modifications to the `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NetSh` path using a tool like Regedit or PowerShell to list changes for further analysis.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to review process creation logs around the time of the registry modification. Pay close attention to any processes that may reference the newly added DLL.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to analyze outbound connections made by the system after the registry change. Look for any suspicious or anomalous communication patterns, especially to unknown destinations.
  - **Review Application Logs:** Check the Windows Application logs for any entries related to Netsh or the modification event. This can provide context on what applications may have triggered or interacted with the registry change.
  ### Prioritization
  The categorization of this alert as medium severity is justified in an enterprise environment since the addition of a DLL to the Netsh registry key is a potential indication of malicious activity. While legitimate applications may utilize this mechanism, the specificity of the detected change warrants further investigation to rule out possible compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  A known blind spot is the potential for false positives due to legitimate applications or system updates that may modify the Netsh registry key to add helper DLLs. Additionally, the rule may not fire if modifications are made using less common or alternative registry paths or if the changes occur in transient states before logging is captured. Engineers should also be aware that sophisticated adversaries could potentially obfuscate their actions, making detection more challenging.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential abuse of custom file open handlers, specifically targeting instances where an unauthorized application utilizes the Windows registry to execute PowerShell scripts. By searching for specific entries in the registry that relate to file opening commands (indicated by the presence of 'shell\open\command\') and checking for PowerShell invocation with the '-command' parameter, the rule seeks to capture malicious attempts to execute scripts via registry modifications. The primary technical data source leveraged here is Windows Registry logs, particularly focusing on changes to file handling commands that involve PowerShell, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1202).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Examine the specific registry keys associated with the file open handler to identify the source and legitimacy of the PowerShell command, paying close attention to any unusual modifications.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Utilize EDR tools to check for associated process creation events linked to the PowerShell execution to find any suspicious activities or processes that may have been spawned in conjunction with the registry changes.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Investigate network logs for any outbound connections that coincide with the time the registry change was made or the PowerShell command was executed, which may indicate data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication.
  - **Check System Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs, specifically Security and Application logs, for any indications of unauthorized access or abnormal behavior that may correlate with the registry activity and PowerShell execution.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity level due to the potential for exploitation through abused registry keys to execute PowerShell, which can lead to a range of malicious behaviors, including data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, or persistent malware installation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Adversaries may utilize legitimate processes or make benign changes that could evade detection, leading to false negatives. Additionally, the rule may not fire if registry monitoring isn't adequately implemented or if custom handlers are removed before detection. It also assumes that standard monitoring practices are in place, without which anomalies might go unnoticed. Evasion techniques, such as employing alternative scripting languages or different methods of execution (e.g., WMI or VBScript), could also bypass this rule.

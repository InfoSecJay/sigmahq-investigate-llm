  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Potential EventLog File Location Tampering" is designed to detect unauthorized changes to the Windows EventLog service configuration, specifically targeting the location of Event Log files (Evtx). By monitoring registry changes, this rule identifies instances where the path for these log files is altered. Such modifications can signify attempts to evade detection or obscuring malicious activity, as adversaries may redirect logs to locations that are less monitored or delete them entirely.
  The rule leverages Windows registry monitoring, looking for entries that correspond to the EventLog service's configuration. Specifically, it inspects registry key modifications under the `\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\` path, focusing on keys that end with `\File` to ensure any attempts to change log locations are flagged. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.002: "Impair Defenses," where attackers manipulate defenses to hinder detection capabilities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Use the Windows Event Logs to review changes made to the EventLog service registry key. Check the history for any unauthorized modifications within the `\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\` path.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Employ EDR solutions to assess processes that were active during the time of the registry modification. Pay close attention to unusual processes that may have facilitated the alteration.
  - **Review Log Access:** Investigate log access patterns using Sysmon logs to identify if any alternate or suspicious locations for event logs are being accessed. This can provide insights into the intent behind the modification.
  - **Assess Other Security Logs:** Utilize additional security logs, including those from AV or NGFW, to identify concurrent suspicious activities such as unexpected network connections or file accesses that may correlate with the registry changes.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of Event Logs in maintaining operational integrity and security oversight. Any tampering with these logs poses a significant risk, as it can facilitate malicious activities by concealing evidence from security monitoring efforts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that registry monitoring is effectively implemented and that the necessary Windows telemetry is being collected. It may not fire if the adversary uses legitimate processes to make registry changes stealthily or if they delete or alter logs after making changes. Additionally, if environment-specific paths are used that don't conform to the expected patterns, the rule may fail to trigger. This highlights the importance of comprehensive logging practices and continual rule evaluation against evolving attack techniques.

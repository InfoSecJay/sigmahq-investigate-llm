  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the addition of new root, Certificate Authority (CA), or AuthRoot certificates to the Windows registry. The presence of these certificates can alter the trust relationship of the device, enabling an attacker to potentially execute malicious code or perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The rule specifically monitors for modifications to key registry paths, which store certificate information, such as `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Root\Certificates\`. The main technical data sources involved in this detection are Windows Registry logs. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1490, which concerns the manipulation of trusted certificates. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check for Indicator of Compromise:** Utilize EDR tools to identify any associated processes that have created or modified the detected registry keys. Look for unusual or non-standard executables that may have caused the change.
  - **Review Recent Changes:** Explore the Windows Security and System event logs for records of recent administrative actions that could indicate legitimate updates to certificate stores or unauthorized changes.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Monitor network connection logs for communication with external servers that correlate to the timeframe of the registry modification, potentially indicating data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.
  - **Evaluate User Activity:** Analyze user activity logs to check for unauthorized access or administrative privileges that might have been used to bypass security measures and introduce malicious certificates.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered of medium severity because while the addition of trusted certificates may be legitimate in controlled scenarios, it could also indicate an active compromise or configuration change that undermines security controls in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the accurate logging of registry operations, so if logging is misconfigured or disabled, the rule may not trigger as intended. Additionally, well-crafted adversarial techniques may involve altering certificates without modifying the registry, thus evading detection. Furthermore, legitimate actions by IT administrators may result in false positives, making it crucial to validate each alert's context through user activity and system management history.

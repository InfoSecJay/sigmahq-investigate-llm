  ### Technical Context
  The "Classes Autorun Keys Modification" Sigma rule is designed to detect modifications made to autostart extensibility points (ASEPs) in the Windows registry, specifically targeting the Software Classes section. This rule analyzes the specific registry keys related to file types and shell extensions, such as context menu handlers, drop handlers, and property sheet handlers. By monitoring for changes in these keys, the rule aims to uncover potential persistence mechanisms that adversaries might use to maintain access or execute malicious code upon specific user actions, as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of persistence (T1547.001). The primary data sources involved in this detection include Windows Registry logs.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Registry Changes:** Review the Windows Registry log to identify the specific modifications made to the identified autostart extensibility point keys. Focus on entries involving the '\Software\Classes' directory.
  - **Correlate with EDR Activity:** Investigate endpoint behavior using EDR tools to identify any suspicious process that may have triggered the registry modification. Look for processes that exhibit unusual behaviors or run from suspicious locations.
  - **Analyze Related Network Traffic:** Utilize network detection tools (NDR) to review network activity around the time of the registry change. Check for any remote connections or suspicious command-and-control (C2) communication that might indicate malicious intent.
  - **Review historical logs:** Cross-check historical logs for related processes or administrative actions from legitimate users that might justify or explain these registry modifications, helping to distinguish between benign and malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity due to its potential to indicate an adversary establishing persistence on a victim system. While not an immediate threat, modifications to autostart keys could lead to significant operational concerns if they facilitate malware execution or unauthorized access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate applications modify these registry keys as part of their installation process, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, if an attacker uses methods to obfuscate their registry changes or employs legitimate tools for their actions, these modifications may go undetected. Analysts should be aware that the presence of legitimate software changes could mask malicious activities, making context and historical behavior critical in investigations.

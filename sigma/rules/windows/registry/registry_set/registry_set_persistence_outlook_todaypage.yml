  Detects potential persistence activity via outlook today page.
  An attacker can set a custom page to execute arbitrary code and link to it via the registry values "URL" and "UserDefinedUrl".

  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential Persistence Via Outlook Today Page" detection rule identifies potentially malicious persistence mechanisms that leverage Microsoft Outlook's functionality. Attackers may manipulate registry keys related to Outlook, specifically those pointing to custom pages, to execute arbitrary code each time Outlook is launched. The rule monitors for changes to registry values under the path `Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Today\`, looking for entries that define URLs (`UserDefinedUrl` and `URL`) and specific settings (`Stamp`). These registry modifications trigger alerts, indicating potential misuse as a command-and-control (C2) mechanism. The associated MITRE ATT&CK technique for this rule is **T1112 
  - Modify Registry** under the **Persistence** tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes**: Use a registry viewer to confirm modifications to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Today\` for any suspicious entries.
  - **Correlate Process Logs**: Check EDR logs for process creation events involving `OUTLOOK.EXE` to establish context around when the malicious registry entries were modified.
  - **Analyze Network Activity**: Inspect outbound traffic logs for connections initiated by Outlook (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS) to see if any unusual or unauthorized servers were contacted post-exploitation.
  - **Review User Activity**: Examine user activity logs and behaviors around the alert timeframe to identify any anomalous actions that may suggest compromises in account usage.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the inherent risk of unauthorized code execution and the potential for prolonged persistence in the environment, allowing an attacker continued access to the system.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if an attacker uses alternate methods to achieve persistence without modifying the specified registry keys, such as employing different Office components or utilizing direct applications without registry interactions. Additionally, if registry changes are made in a manner not captured by the selection criteria (e.g., non-standard registry paths), the rule may fail to detect the activity. It's assumed that monitoring is effective across all user accounts and that users have minimal legitimate use of custom Outlook pages, which may lead to false positives in certain environments.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for changes made to the Windows registry that indicate an attacker may be disabling the Windows Defender service (WinDefend) by altering its startup type. Specifically, it looks for registry modifications where the `TargetObject` pertains to the WinDefend service start-up setting, checking for a value of `DWORD (0x00000004)`, which signifies that the service has been disabled. This kind of alteration is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection and maintain persistence after a compromise. The relevant data source for this rule is the Windows Registry, with particular attention to the `registry_set` category. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001), which involves disabling security measures to facilitate malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Utilize Windows Security logs to trace back to the specific registry modification events that have impacted the WinDefend service. Cross-reference the alert time with user accounts and system actions.
  - **Check for Related Activity:** Examine EDR logs for any associated process creation or execution that may have led to the registry modification, specifically focusing on any unusual or unauthorized commands executed around the alert timeframe.
  - **Analyze User Account Activity:** Inspect the activity of user accounts that made changes to the registry to determine if the account was compromised or if the actions were legitimate administrative changes, utilizing application logs for additional context.
  - **Evaluate Endpoint Security Posture:** Use endpoint protection solutions to verify the current status of Windows Defender on the affected system and conduct a wider investigation to assess whether other security measures have been disabled or corrupted.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts from this detection rule are prioritized as high severity due to the critical nature of disabling antivirus protections, which can lead to severe consequences if exploited by malicious actors.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary uses stealthy techniques to disable the Windows Defender service through methods that do not involve direct registry changes, such as manipulating system services via APIs or using process injection tactics. Additionally, the rule assumes that proper permissions and access controls are in place within the environment to prevent unauthorized changes. False positives can arise from legitimate administrative actions that involve disabling security services for maintenance or troubleshooting.

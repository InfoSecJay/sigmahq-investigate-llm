  ### Technical Context
  The "Registry Modification to Hidden File Extension" detection rule is designed to identify modifications made to the Windows Registry that enable file extension hiding on user systems. Specifically, it looks for changes to the "HideFileExt" and "Hidden" registry keys located under the path `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`. When the "HideFileExt" DWORD value is set to `1`, file extensions for known file types will be hidden in the Windows File Explorer, while a DWORD value of `2` for the "Hidden" key indicates that items marked as hidden will not be displayed. Both modifications could indicate potentially suspicious behavior often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware and adversaries seeking to conceal their activities. This behavior correlates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1137 under the persistence tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to query for registry modifications in the Registry Set category, focusing specifically on changes to `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`.
  - **Review Related Processes:** Examine the EDR for any processes that may have executed in conjunction with the registry changes, especially those related to file management or command-line utilities that could have modified these settings.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Correlate user activity logs, such as logon events and command execution logs, to identify any legitimate administrative actions that may have led to these registry changes or if malicious behavior is evident.
  - **Identify Threat Actor Behavior:** Cross-reference these modifications with known threat actor techniques related to file hiding or persistence, leveraging threat intelligence feeds for context.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as medium due to its potential to indicate the presence of malware or unauthorized changes within the system, particularly in environments that are vigilant about user-controlled settings in relation to file visibility.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the registry changes were made through legitimate administrative scripts or tools that are whitelisted within the organization. Additionally, if adversaries employ techniques that do not alter these specific registry keys, or if there are discrepancies in the logging configuration that fail to capture these events, the rule may not trigger. Adverse scenarios could include modifications through direct system access, exploitation of existing permissions, or other non-logged methods of execution.

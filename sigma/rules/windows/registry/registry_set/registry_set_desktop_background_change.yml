  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious changes to a user's desktop background via registry modifications. This behavior is often indicative of malware activity, specifically ransomware attacks, where the desktop wallpaper is altered to display ransom notes or alerts. The rule monitors changes made to specific registry keys associated with desktop settings, such as `Control Panel\Desktop` and `CurrentVersion\Policies\ActiveDesktop`. It particularly focuses on modifications that set the wallpaper, potentially malicious values, or specific settings that restrict changing the desktop background. The detected changes may indicate either an attempt to evade detection (defense evasion) or may lead to a significant impact on the user's ability to interact with their system (impact). This behavior relates to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1112 (Modification of Registry) and T1491.001 (Resource Hijacking: Desktop Hijacking).
  The SIEM detects those registry entries that typically control wallpaper settings (`Wallpaper`, `WallpaperStyle`, `NoChangingWallpaper`). By examining these logs, analysts can identify potential malicious activities that alter user environments without authorization. Utilizing telemetry like Windows Security and Registry logs, the detection rule provides insights into unauthorized modifications, helping the SOC respond swiftly to potential threats.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Check the Windows Registry for any modifications to `Control Panel\Desktop`, `CurrentVersion\Policies\ActiveDesktop`, and `CurrentVersion\Policies\System` to identify unauthorized changes.
  - **Correlate Event Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate the time of the registry modification with process creation logs and other security events to determine the source of the change.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Investigate user login activity and any recently executed scripts or applications, utilizing AV and endpoint logs to identify any potential malicious software.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Review network connection logs for unusual outbound activity or connections to known malicious IP addresses that could indicate ransomware or similar malware presence.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to its potential association with ransomware behavior; while not every instance will indicate a true incident, the risk of significant impact necessitates prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the desktop background change is executed by a highly privileged user or through Group Policy Objects (GPO), which are common administrative practices. Furthermore, any legitimate administrative scripts aimed at corporate branding may produce false positives. Engineers should also consider that adversaries may deploy obfuscation techniques to bypass detection by employing less suspicious methods or modifying registry values outside of standard practices.

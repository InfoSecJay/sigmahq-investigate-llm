  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect a bypass of User Account Control (UAC) via the Windows Event Viewer using registry modifications. The technique exploited here involves altering the registry key associated with Event Viewer to escalate privileges without triggering UAC prompts, thereby launching applications with elevated permissions. The rule specifically looks for modifications made to registry paths ending with `\mscfile\shell\open\command`, which are indicative of this type of bypass. The primary data source involved in this detection is the Windows Registry, which logs changes to its structure and values. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique represented by this rule is T1548.002 (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate Registry Modifications:** Review the Windows Registry logs for any alterations to the `\mscfile\shell\open\command` key to confirm the detected event and identify the process responsible for the modification.
    
  - **Analyze Process Creation Events:** Cross-reference the detection with recent process creation logs in Sysmon to understand what executable may have been launched using the elevated privileges.
  - **Check System and Security Logs:** Examine Windows Security and System event logs for any related events surrounding the time of the registry modification. Look for unusual login events or process access attempts that may correlate with privilege escalation.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to check for associated alerts that may indicate malicious activities or indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to the potential for an attacker to exploit this bypass to gain unauthorized administrative access to critical systems, significantly increasing the risk of data breaches or further compromise.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not detect the UAC bypass if the modification is performed by an already privileged user or if the registry key is targeted in a non-standard manner. Additionally, an adversary may defeat this detection by tampering with logs or using alternate techniques that do not involve the registry. It is also assumed that the environment is configured to log registry changes appropriately; if logging is disabled or misconfigured, the rule may fail to trigger.

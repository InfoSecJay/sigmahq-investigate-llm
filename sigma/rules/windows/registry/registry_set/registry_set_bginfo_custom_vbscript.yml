  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the setting of a new registry value associated with the BgInfo utility, which is part of the Winternals suite commonly used for displaying system information on Windows desktops. Specifically, it looks for registry modifications to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Winternals\BGInfo\UserFields\`, where malicious actors may configure BgInfo to execute custom VBScript. The manipulation of this registry key can facilitate defense evasion tactics, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary scripts under the guise of a legitimate application. This activity maps to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112 
  - "Modify Registry," which involves the use of registry keys to conceal or maintain malicious behaviors.
  To detect these changes, the rule utilizes telemetry from Windows registry event logs, specifically focusing on events of type `SetValue`, which indicate modifications to the registry. Analyzing the details of these events, responders can determine potential malicious activities surrounding the management and execution of scripts on endpoint systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Triggering Event Logs**: Check the Windows Event Logs for any `SetValue` events related to the specified registry path to confirm if the alert corresponds with recent system changes.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data**: Utilize EDR tools to investigate the context in which the BgInfo was modified. Look for associated process creation and command-line arguments that can provide additional details regarding the command's execution.
  - **Assess User and System Impact**: Identify the user account that made the registry modification and determine if this account typically uses BgInfo. Evaluate the systemâ€™s health for unusual behavior that may indicate a larger compromise.
  - **Validate with Proxy and Script Logs**: Look through proxy and script logs to confirm if any unusual or unauthorized VBScript executions were performed post-modification of the registry key, further ruling in or out malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert can indicate malicious tampering with system configurations via registry modifications, it is prioritized as medium severity. Rapid detection and response are critical to preventing the execution of potentially harmful scripts that could lead to further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This alert may not trigger if the attacker uses a different method to execute scripts that bypass the BgInfo configuration mechanism or if legitimate applications similarly modify the registry without malicious intent. Additionally, it assumes that the organization uses BgInfo in a conventional manner, meaning all uses outside the norm should be flagged for review. There is also the potential for false negatives if the event logging is disabled or if event retention policies result in the loss of necessary logs.

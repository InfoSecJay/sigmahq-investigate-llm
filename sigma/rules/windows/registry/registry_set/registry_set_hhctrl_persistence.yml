  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential persistence mechanisms via the modification of a specific registry key associated with the Windows Help common control library, `hhctrl.ocx`. Attackers often modify the registry to redirect legitimate Windows processes to malicious binaries, allowing them to maintain persistence on compromised systems. Specifically, this rule looks for changes to the registry object representing `hhctrl.ocx` that point to a non-standard binary instead of the expected legitimate file. The primary data sources involved in this detection are Windows registry changes logs, specifically monitoring for registry set operations. It relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Persistence tactic, specifically the technique T1547.002 (Windows Service).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes**: Utilize registry auditing to analyze recent changes made to the InprocServer32 value associated with `hhctrl.ocx`, confirming the legitimacy of the binary path.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data**: Investigate related process creation logs in EDR to confirm if any processes are being executed that correspond to the modified registry key, particularly looking for unusual command lines or parent processes.
  - **Review Image Load Events**: Use Sysmon image load events to identify any instances where `hhctrl.ocx` or associated binaries have been loaded, checking for anomalies in the file paths and signatures.
  - **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Perform a wider threat hunt using both network and endpoint telemetry to establish if any other persistence mechanisms have been implemented or to check for lateral movement related to the detected modification.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the critical nature of persistence mechanisms in compromising system integrity and maintaining adversarial access. Early detection can significantly mitigate broader system compromise and data exfiltration risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Detected modifications may not capture the entirety of an attacker's persistence strategies, especially if they employ methods that do not modify this specific registry key. Additionally, legitimate software updates or system management tasks could inadvertently result in similar registry changes, leading to false positives. Analysts should be aware that advanced threat actors may use obfuscation techniques or benign-looking binaries to bypass this detection mechanism.

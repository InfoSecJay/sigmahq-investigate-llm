  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify the installation of suspicious keyboard layouts within user sessions on Windows systems. Specifically, it focuses on keyboard layouts that are not typically used by staff based in the United States, such as Persian, Vietnamese, and Chinese layouts. The rule works by monitoring the Windows Registry for changes that occur within specific registry keys related to keyboard layouts, namely `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload` and `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Substitutes`. When such layouts are detected, particularly those associated with non-US regions, it raises an alert for further investigation. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1588.002 (Resource Development: Credential Dumping), as the alteration of keyboard layouts might indicate a potential preparation for malicious activity, such as credential harvesting tailored for specific languages.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Use Sysmon or Registry monitoring tools to confirm registry changes occurred within the specified `Keyboard Layout` keys, checking for any unauthorized or unexpected keyboard layout installations.
  - **Review User Context:** Investigate the user accounts associated with the registry changes. If the account is not recognized, or if it belongs to non-administrative users, this may warrant further scrutiny.
  - **Analyze Related Activity:** Check for any recent process creation or script execution, particularly PowerShell commands, that might indicate malicious intent or attempts to manipulate input for credential theft.
  - **Monitor Incoming Network Traffic:** Use your EDR and network monitoring tools to detect any unusual outbound connections or commands that may be linked to the identified keyboard layout changes, which could indicate data exfiltration or command and control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is considered medium as it flags potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation, particularly given the contextual focus on US staff and unusual language layouts. However, false positives may occur if legitimate users employ these layouts, which requires careful validation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One key assumption of this rule is that the environment is adequately monitored for changes to the specified registry keys. If Sysmon is not configured correctly or if there are gaps in logging, the rule may not fire despite suspicious activity. Moreover, sophisticated adversaries may employ methods to conceal their activity, such as using native tools to manipulate registry settings or disguising their actions under legitimate user activity, which could lead to a failure to trigger alerts. Organizations should consider potential usage of the flagged layouts by legitimate users to reduce false positives during investigations.

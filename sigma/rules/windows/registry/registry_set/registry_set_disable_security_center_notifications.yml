  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect modifications to the Windows registry that disable security notifications via the Windows Security Center by setting the `UseActionCenterExperience` value to `0`. The rule specifically monitors changes in the registry path `Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell`, which is associated with Windows notifications and security alerts. When an adversary seeks to decrease the visibility of their malicious activities, they may manipulate system settings to disable security alerts, allowing their actions to go unnoticed. This behavior is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112: Modify Registry to alter the behavior of Windows notifications systems. By tracking registry modifications in real-time, this rule aims to provide insight into potential security evasion tactics employed by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Examine the associated registry keys using tools such as Sysinternals' Process Monitor or Windows Registry Editor to confirm unauthorized changes to the `UseActionCenterExperience` value.
  - **Identify User Context:** Utilize EDR solutions to correlate the process that triggered the registry modification and identify which user account executed it, paying special attention to any suspicious user behavior.
  - **Analyze Recent Alerts:** Check your SIEM for any related alerts or previous events that may indicate deliberate tampering with Windows security features, helping to establish a timeline of activities.
  - **Audit System Integrity:** Review other security and system logs, including Windows Event Logs and Sysmon data, to identify any additional concerning changes or processes that may relate to the disabling of security notifications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as medium severity because modifications to system security settings directly impact the organization's ability to detect intrusions or malicious activities, warranting prompt investigation to confirm whether an actual threat exists.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where the attacker employs a method to alter the registry without user-level access or processes that could evade detection, such as utilizing stealth techniques or employing rootkits. Additionally, if the setting is changed through Group Policy or other authorized administrative actions, false positives may occur. Security teams should also be aware that adversaries may resort to using legitimate tools to effect changes in the registry, disguising their activities as standard maintenance.

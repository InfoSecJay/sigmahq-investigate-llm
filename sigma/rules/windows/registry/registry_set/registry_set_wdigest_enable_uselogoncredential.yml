  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies modifications to the Windows registry specific to the WDigest security provider, which can enable the storage of logon credentials in clear text. The rule is triggered when a change is made to `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest` with the property value `UseLogonCredential` set to `1`. This alteration poses a significant security risk because it allows credentials to be stored in a format that can be easily accessed by malicious actors, potentially leading to credential theft and unauthorized access. These changes will be captured through Windows Registry logs (reg_set) monitored by Sysmon, and they fall under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1112 
  - Modify Registry).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Modifications:** Use your EDR tool to examine the registry modification event and verify the target object and value changed. Focus on the process and user context that made the change to assess legitimacy.
    
  - **Review Process Activity:** Investigate the process that initiated the registry modification by correlating the timestamp with recent process creation logs. Look for any suspicious or unknown processes that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Analyze User Actions:** Examine relevant logs, such as Windows Security and System logs, to see if the change was preceded or followed by any anomalous user account behavior, such as failed login attempts or access from unusual IP addresses.
  - **Consult Threat Intelligence:** Utilize threat intelligence sources and logs, including proxy and network logs, to see if the systems have communicated with known malicious IP addresses or domains around the time of the registry modification.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a high severity level in an enterprise environment due to the implications of storing credentials in clear text, which could lead to large-scale credential compromise and further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule might not fire if the registry modification occurs using a means that does not generate Sysmon logs or if sufficient privileges are not held by the modifying entity. Additionally, there exists a possibility that legitimate software may require this change, potentially leading to false positives. Engineers should consider monitoring for processes that modify registry keys in conjunction with this rule to bolster fidelity.

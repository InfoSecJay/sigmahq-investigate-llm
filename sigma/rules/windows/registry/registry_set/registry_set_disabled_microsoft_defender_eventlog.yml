  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on detecting the disabling of the Windows Defender event log, which is a critical security feature that can indicate potential malicious activities. Specifically, it looks for modifications to the registry key associated with Windows Defender's operational channels, where the value of the key is set to zero (DWORD: 0x00000000). Such a change is often a tactic used in defense evasion by adversaries, particularly in relation to malware families like Lockbit 3.0 that aim to avoid detection by disabling security features. In this case, the relevant technical data sources include Windows Registry events, specifically those related to registry modifications. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion and the technique T1562.001: Disable or Modify Tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use your EDR solution to inspect registry modification logs for changes to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational`.
    
  - **Correlate with Event Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs, focusing on Security and System logs, to identify actions taken around the time the event log was disabled, such as process creation or administrative access.
  - **Analyze Running Processes:** Identify any processes that may have been running at the time of the registry modification by querying your EDR tool for active processes and their associated command-line arguments.
  - **Check for Other AV Interference:** Investigate if other antivirus applications are installed or running on the endpoint, as they could potentially cause false positives related to changes in Windows Defender logs.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to its potential association with sophisticated threat actors attempting to evade detection mechanisms, suggesting that immediate investigation is necessary to ensure no compromise has occurred.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where group policies or other management tools disable Windows Defender in a controlled manner, leading to legitimate changes that fall outside the scope of this detection. Additionally, if other antimalware solutions are deployed, they might manage the Windows Defender settings in a way that prevents logging activity related to disabling operations. Engineers should consider the operating environment's control measures and possible variations in how other organizations configure their endpoint security.

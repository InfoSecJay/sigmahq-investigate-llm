  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially unauthorized modifications to the SentinelOne shell context menu scan command within the Windows registry. It targets changes to the command string associated with the SentinelOne context menu item, specifically seeking modifications that occur from processes that are not part of the SentinelOne software suite itself. By monitoring the registry paths that reference the SentinelOne scan command, the rule can identify suspicious alterations, which may indicate an attempt by an adversary to tamper with or exploit the command for malicious purposes. The relevant technical data source involved in this detection is Windows registry logs, specifically those that track `registry_set` events. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Persistence** (T1547) as it captures potential rebound or persistence mechanisms that attackers may leverage to maintain control over a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process:** Check the process responsible for the registry change using EDR tools to determine if it is a legitimate SentinelOne process or potentially malicious.
  - **Analyze Registry Changes:** Utilize Windows tools or scripts to examine the specific registry key and value modifications to understand the extent of the changes made.
  - **Cross-reference Timeframe:** Match the timing of the registry modification with other security events (e.g., process creation or network connections) to establish a timeline of activities leading up to the alert.
  - **Watch for Related Evidence:** Review other telemetry, such as Sysmon logs for suspicious process creation or GPO changes, to detect any correlated malicious behavior or lateral movement attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is classified as medium due to the potential for malicious changes to a crucial security feature of the host, which could indicate a compromise. While not a definitive sign of a breach, such modifications warrant immediate investigation to prevent further exploitation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an attacker uses legitimate SentinelOne processes to affect registry changes or if the system is not running the SentinelOne agent, as there would be no expected command set to monitor. Additionally, if the environmental path for the SentinelOne application is altered or if the attack occurs on a system without the product installed, the rule will fail to detect such tampering. It is assumed that SentinelOne is actively managing the context menu, so environments using different security mechanisms or custom configurations may not be adequately covered by this rule.

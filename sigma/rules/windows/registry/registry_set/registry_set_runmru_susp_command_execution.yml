  Detects execution of commands via the run dialog box on Windows by checking values of the "RunMRU" registry key.
  This technique was seen being abused by threat actors to deceive users into pasting and executing malicious commands, often disguised as CAPTCHA verification steps.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially suspicious command executions on Windows systems, particularly those that occur through the Run dialog box. It achieves this by monitoring the `RunMRU` (Most Recently Used) registry key, which stores the most recent commands executed via the Run dialog. Adversaries often exploit this functionality to execute malicious commands masked as benign actions, such as CAPTCHA verifications. The rule inspects not only the registry changes but also checks for specific PowerShell and WMIC commands that may indicate malicious intent, focusing on patterns that are regularly associated with command execution attacks. This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Execution, specifically technique T1059.001 for PowerShell.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Check the `RunMRU` registry key in Windows for any unexpected or suspicious command executions that have been logged recently.
  - **Analyze Associated Process Creation Logs:** Using EDR tools, correlate the time of the suspicious registry change with process creation events to trace the origin of the command execution.
  - **Inspect PowerShell and WMIC Command Logs:** Review PowerShell and WMIC command logs for the presence of executed commands containing known suspicious keywords or patterns that match the rule's detection logic.
  - **Cross-Reference with Network Activity:** Use network logs (e.g., from the firewall or proxy) to identify any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts that occurred in connection to the identified command execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The high-severity level of this alert indicates a significant level of risk in an enterprise environment, as the execution of commands through the Run dialog could facilitate malware deployment or unauthorized system changes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where registry monitoring is disabled, or if malicious actors employ techniques to obfuscate their commands beyond the specified keywords. Additionally, it assumes that users maintain standard operational security and do not frequently execute legitimate commands that may trigger this alert. False positives may arise from benign administrative activities or applications misusing the Run dialog. Moreover, threat actors could potentially utilize different tactics or evade detection by using commands not captured by the defined keywords.

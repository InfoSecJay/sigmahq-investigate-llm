  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential attempts to bypass Windows application signing enforcement by enabling various developer features. Specifically, it focuses on monitoring the Windows registry for modifications related to "Developer Mode" and "Application Sideloading." These features permit the installation of untrusted applications, posing significant risks to the security posture of an enterprise. When a user or threat actor modifies the registry keys associated with `AppModelUnlock` or alters settings such as `AllowAllTrustedApps` and `AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense`, it creates a significant risk for malicious software to be installed without proper verification. The detection leverages the Windows Registry logs as a primary data source, allowing analysts to identify suspicious configuration changes that could indicate defense evasion tactics according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically mapping to the technique under the tactic of Defense Evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Use Windows Security logs to examine the registry modifications referenced in the alert. Pay close attention to the timestamps and source processes that made these changes.
    
  - **Cross-Reference with EDR:** Utilize your EDR solution to investigate the endpoints associated with registry changes, looking for any unusual processes or behaviors that may correlate with the alert.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Check Sysmon process creation logs to identify if any processes were spawned in conjunction with the registry changes. This can help in identifying potential malware or illicit activity.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Review network connections originating from affected systems to ensure that there are no nefarious external communications tied to the registry changes identified.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level of this alert is warranted due to the potential for enabling untrusted applications to run within the enterprise environment, which could lead to systems being compromised or data loss. Rapid response to such alerts is crucial to maintain the integrity and security of organizational assets.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses alternate methods to modify registry settings without triggering logging, such as utilizing built-in Windows tools with elevated privileges or if these modifications occur in a timeframe that does not align with typical user behavior. Additionally, if security features are poorly configured or logging is disabled for certain registry actions, the detection may fail. Analysts should assume that malicious actors are continuously developing methods to evade detection.

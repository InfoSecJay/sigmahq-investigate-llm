  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential disabling of the Windows Firewall through changes made to specific registry keys in the Windows operating system. The rule specifically monitors regkeys associated with the Windows Firewall—Standard Profile and Domain Profile—focused on the `EnableFirewall` setting. When this setting is altered to `0`, it indicates that the Windows Firewall has been disabled, which can expose the system to various threats and unauthorized access. By monitoring these registry changes, the rule acts as an early warning system to detect possible malicious intent or system misconfigurations. This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.004 (Disable Security Tools), which emphasizes actions taken by attackers to evade detection and maintain control over compromised environments.
  The primary data source for this rule is Windows Registry logs, specifically changes to registry values that pertain to firewall settings. These logs provide insights into the configuration states of critical security mechanisms on Windows endpoints, alerting analysts when suspicious modifications occur.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Settings:** Review the registry keys under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\` to confirm the `EnableFirewall` status and verify if it has indeed been set to `0`.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Use EDR tools to examine the account that made the registry change, assessing user credentials and associated activities to determine if the change aligns with standard operational practices.
  - **Review Event Logs:** Inspect Windows Security Event Logs for any abnormal authentication attempts or user actions around the time the registry change occurred. Correlate these with any other potential indicators of compromise.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Utilize network data from the NDR to identify any unusual outbound connections that may indicate exploitation attempts or malware communications, particularly immediately following the firewall change.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is categorized as medium because while disabling the firewall can represent a significant security risk, additional context is necessary to confirm malicious intent. This includes reviewing user activity and correlating with other findings within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if registry monitoring is not enabled or if the modification occurs through non-standard methods (e.g., scripts or tools that do not interact with the registry in a conventional manner). Additionally, administrators may legitimately change these settings for specific maintenance tasks, leading to false positives. Furthermore, if malware utilizes sophisticated techniques to disable the firewall without directly changing the registry (e.g., through kernel-level manipulation), this rule may fail to detect such actions.

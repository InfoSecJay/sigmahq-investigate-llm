  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects registry changes related to "Trusted Locations" in Microsoft Office applications where the path set is uncommon. Trusted Locations in Office allow macros to run without prompting security warnings, making them a potential target for attackers looking to bypass macro security restrictions. The rule specifically looks for modifications in the registry paths under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<version>\Security\Trusted Locations\Location` to identify paths that do not match known legitimate locations, thereby signaling a potentially malicious action. The relevant technical data sources include Windows registry logs. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112 (Modify Registry), which falls under the defense evasion tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Query the Windows Registry for recent changes to the "Trusted Locations" to identify any unauthorized modifications. This can help determine if an attacker has tried to exploit Office macros.
  - **Correlate EDR Events:** Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to analyze processes that executed around the same time as the registry change. Look for indicators of compromise such as unusual process names or behaviors.
  - **Review Security Logs:** Examine Windows Security logs for any related event IDs that may indicate suspicious login attempts or privilege escalations that coincide with the registry modifications.
  - **Analyze User Behavior:** Investigate the user account associated with the change to see if it shows any signs of compromise or unusual activity patterns, such as accessing unexpected files or using tools that are not typically part of standard user operations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity due to the risk that an attacker may successfully add a malicious trusted location in Microsoft Office, allowing the execution of harmful macros without alerting users, potentially leading to data compromise and further infiltration of the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses valid paths that are not included in the excluded paths list, thereby evading detection. Additionally, if the organization utilizes custom or legitimate trusted locations that are not widely recognized, these could generate false positives. The rule assumes that the Windows registry is being monitored accurately; if registry auditing is not enabled, changes may go unnoticed. Threat actors may also use different techniques to achieve similar objectives, reducing the effectiveness of this specific detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Registry Hide Function from User" Sigma rule is designed to detect malicious modifications to the Windows Registry that hide essential tools or functions from user visibility, a technique often employed by malware such as Agent Tesla and Hermetic Wiper. This rule specifically monitors registry changes that involve settings related to the visibility of system elements, such as the clock and network information. It focuses on the `TargetObject` registry paths that denote user interface elements and their visibility settings, ensuring these critical components remain exposed to the user. The data source for this detection is Windows Registry logs, which capture modifications made by processes running on the system. The rule addresses the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112 (Modify Registry), under the Tactic of Defense Evasion, highlighting the importance of monitoring registry changes as part of a comprehensive security posture.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Examine the Windows Registry for recent changes to the paths specified in the alert (e.g., `HideClock`, `HideSCAHealth`, etc.) to verify whether unauthorized modifications have been made.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to identify processes that executed changes to the Registry and look for any known malware signatures or unusual behavior associated with those processes.
  - **Anomaly Detection in Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application) for any concurrent events that may indicate suspicious activities linked to the detected registry modifications.
  - **Network Activity Assessment:** Investigate network connection logs (NDR/NGFW) to determine if any suspicious communications were established by the processes involved during the time of the registry change.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for such registry changes to conceal malicious activities from users and security measures, thereby indicating a possible compromise or active exploitation within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There may be legitimate administrative actions that modify these registry entries without malicious intent, which might produce false positives for this rule. Additionally, the rule may not fire if the attackers employ methods to revert changes immediately after execution or utilize other techniques that do not involve direct registry manipulation as described. Assumptions in this detection include that the system is configured to log registry changes adequately and that any modifications made by trusted admin scripts will not match the defined selection criteria.

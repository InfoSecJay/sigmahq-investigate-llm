title: Lsass Full Dump Request Via DumpType Registry Settings
id: 33efc23c-6ea2-4503-8cfe-bdf82ce8f719
status: test
description: Detects the setting of the "DumpType" registry value to "2" which stands
  for a "Full Dump". Technique such as LSASS Shtinkering requires this value to be
  "2" in order to dump LSASS.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on the detection of modifications to the Windows Registry that may facilitate the dumping of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. Specifically, it looks for changes to the `DumpType` registry value under the paths `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\` and `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\lsass.exe\`. Setting the `DumpType` value to `2` indicates a request for a “Full Dump” of the LSASS process, which is often targeted by attackers seeking to extract sensitive credentials and secrets stored in memory. This rule falls under the credential access tactic (MITRE ATT&CK technique T1003.001), as it directly relates to techniques for obtaining sensitive information from LSASS.
  When the registry paths are modified to enable a full dump, it may signify malicious intent, especially in the context of credential theft. The detection leverages the Windows Registry logs to monitor changes to these specific values, enabling security operations teams to identify potential attacks in progress. The use of the registry to manipulate process memory access is a common tactic employed by threat actors, making this an important detection point for safeguarding enterprise environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to check for recent changes to `DumpType` in the specified registry paths to confirm the timing and context of the modification.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Using EDR, analyze processes that were active around the time of the registry modification to identify any suspicious processes that might have initiated the dump request.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators:** Look for other signs of credential harvesting activity, such as abnormal PowerShell commands or unexpected network connections that may suggest data exfiltration.
  - **Evaluate User Context:** Determine if the user or process making the registry change has a legitimate reason for modifying LSASS dump settings, assessing the user's role and history of activity within the environment.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high-severity due to the critical nature of LSASS in managing user credentials and security policies. Modifying the dump settings to allow a full memory dump of LSASS indicates a potential compromise or preparatory step for credential theft, which necessitates immediate attention.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - **Legitimate Use Cases:** The rule may trigger false positives in legitimate applications that require full process dumps for troubleshooting or support purposes; understanding the normal applications in the environment is essential.
  - **Admin Access:** Changes to the registry can typically be made by users with administrative privileges. This means that an authenticated administrator could feasibly make benign changes, which presents a challenge in distinguishing between legitimate and malicious activity.
  - **Lack of Monitoring Post-Change:** The rule only detects the set registry value and does not monitor subsequent dump activities. An adversary may adjust their tactics to avoid leaving registry traces, using different methods to achieve their goals.
  - **Variability in Environment:** Differences in Windows versions and configurations may impact where or how these values are set. Ensure cross-environment consistency when interpreting alerts.

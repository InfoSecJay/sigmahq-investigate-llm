  # Documentation for Sigma Rule: Antivirus Filter Driver Disallowed On Dev Drive 
  - Registry
  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies when a user disables the functionality of antivirus mini filters on a "Dev Drive" in Windows environments through registry changes. Specifically, the rule looks for modifications to the registry key `\FilterManager\FltmgrDevDriveAllowAntivirusFilter`, with a value set to `0` (DWORD 0x00000000). This action could indicate potential evasion tactics employed by an adversary to disable security measures for a specific volume type, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique of **Defense Evasion (T1562.001)**. The primary data source for this rule is Windows registry logs, which provide visibility into system configuration changes that might compromise security.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Change Logs:** Check the Windows registry logs for any recent changes to the `\FilterManager\FltmgrDevDriveAllowAntivirusFilter` key and correlate timestamps with user activities for context.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Investigate the user account that made the change, including their recent login times and the history of any executed commands using Windows Event Logs or EDR.
  - **Analyze Endpoint Protection Logs:** Inspect logs from the antivirus solution to determine if there were any alerts or anomalies related to antivirus functionality prior to the registry change.
  - **Conduct Network Traffic Analysis:** Utilize NDR to analyze any related network activity that could indicate anomalous behavior associated with the user or system at the time of the registry modification.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert should be treated with high severity because disabling antivirus filters on specific drives increases the risk of successful exploitation by malware, posing a significant threat to enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not activate if the registry change is made via methods that employ administrative privileges, such as through Group Policy, or if the device is compromised by an advanced adversary capable of evading detection. Additionally, the detection depends on timely and correctly configured logging of registry changes; any gaps in logging or inadequate monitoring settings may prevent the rule from firing.

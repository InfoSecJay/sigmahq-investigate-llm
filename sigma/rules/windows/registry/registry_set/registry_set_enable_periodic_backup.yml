title: Periodic Backup For System Registry Hives Enabled
id: 973ef012-8f1a-4c40-93b4-7e659a5cd17f
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the enabling of the "EnablePeriodicBackup" registry value. Once enabled, The OS will backup System registry hives on restarts to the "C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack" folder. Windows creates a "RegIdleBackup" task to manage subsequent backups.
  Registry backup was a default behavior on Windows and was disabled as of "Windows 10, version 1803".

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule monitors changes to the Windows registry to detect when the `EnablePeriodicBackup` value is set to `1`. When enabled, the Windows operating system backs up the system registry hives each time the system restarts, storing these backups in the `C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack` directory. This action is managed by a scheduled task named `RegIdleBackup`. The ability to create periodic backups of the registry was a default feature in prior versions of Windows but was disabled starting with Windows 10, version 1803. Enabling this option may signify an administrative command to preserve configuration settings, but it can also reflect adversarial behavior intending to create additional recovery points during an ongoing compromise. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1113: Screen Capture**, as capturing this kind of configuration change can be pivotal for long-term access management. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Registry Changes:** Utilize the Windows Event Logs to query for recent changes to registry keys related to `EnablePeriodicBackup` to confirm if it was deliberately altered.
  - **Review Task Scheduler:** Investigate the Task Scheduler logs to check for the presence and configuration of the `RegIdleBackup` task that automates the backup process upon reboot.
  - **Analyze Recent System Activity:** Use EDR tools to monitor for any unusual activity tied to processes interacting with the registry or accessing the `RegBack` directory around the time of the registry change.
  - **Assess User Actions:** Examine logs from auditing systems or administrative tools to identify who enabled the registry change and whether it aligns with legitimate administrative actions or not.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a medium severity level as enabling periodic registry backups could indicate an attempt to mitigate the impact of system changes by administrators but may also be associated with malicious actions aimed at preserving a foothold in the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that logging for registry changes is comprehensively maintained and that admins properly document any legitimate changes. It may not fire if the registry value is changed without following the defined path or if security measures prevent logging of registry alterations. Adversaries could also negate this detection by executing the change silently or using processes that do not interact with the Windows registry in a detectable manner.

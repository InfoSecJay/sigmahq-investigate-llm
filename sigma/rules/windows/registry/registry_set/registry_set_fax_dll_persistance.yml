  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify potential persistence mechanisms used by attackers through the manipulation of the Fax DLL (`fxst30.dll`). The rule focuses on registry modifications that interact with the Fax device providers under the Windows registry path `\Software\Microsoft\Fax\Device Providers\`. When adversaries seek to maintain control over a system, they may alter the Fax service DLL to execute malicious payloads by ensuring the DLL is loaded during service restarts. The primary data source for this detection is the Windows registry logs, assessing user and system activities related to the loading of the Fax DLL. This detection strategy aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the technique T1112, which references the manipulation of service registry entries for the purpose of maintaining persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Use Windows Event Logs, specifically the Security and System logs, to review recent registry modifications within `\Software\Microsoft\Fax\Device Providers\` to confirm unauthorized changes.
  - **Analyze DLL Activity:** Utilize Sysmon logs to track process creation events that involve the loading of `fxst30.dll`, ensuring it hasnâ€™t been replaced or tampered with.
  - **Inspect Running Services:** Check the status of the Fax service and any associated processes using the Task Manager or a functionally equivalent EDR tool to identify any suspicious behavior or anomalies.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Leverage network connection logs to evaluate any unexpected outbound communication from processes linked to the manipulated Fax DLL, which could indicate data exfiltration or command and control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because the modification of critical DLLs related to essential system services can indicate advanced adversarial behavior aimed at maintaining a foothold within the environment. Prompt investigation is crucial to mitigate potential risks associated with persistent threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the attacker uses an alternative method of persistence that does not involve modifying the Fax DLL, or if changes occur outside the monitoring capabilities of the enterprise's registry logs. Additionally, administrative access or legitimate user actions could inadvertently create false negatives. It's important to ensure that all relevant logs, including those from EDR and Sysmon, are being collected and stored to prevent evasion tactics employed by adversaries.

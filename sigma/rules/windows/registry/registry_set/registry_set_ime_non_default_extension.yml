  Detects usage of Windows Input Method Editor (IME) keyboard layout feature, which allows an attacker to load a DLL into the process after sending the WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST message.
  Before doing this, the client needs to register the DLL in a special registry key that is assumed to implement this keyboard layout. This registry key should store a value named "Ime File" with a DLL path.
  IMEs are essential for languages that have more characters than can be represented on a standard keyboard, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activity involving the Windows Input Method Editor (IME) by monitoring specific registry changes. IMEs allow for a DLL to be loaded into a process through the manipulation of keyboard layouts, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code. The rule focuses on any registry keys related to IME settings, particularly those that reference the "Ime File" value expected to point to a DLL path. Specifically, it looks at keys under `\Control\Keyboard Layouts\` to see if they are associated with uncommon or suspicious file extensions (".ime"), which are not typically used for legitimate applications. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001, which focuses on defense evasion techniques by exploiting system features like IMEs to run unauthorized code.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Registry Modifications:** Use tools like Windows Registry Editor or PowerShell to investigate the registry entries under `\Control\Keyboard Layouts\`. Check for newly added "Ime File" values that point to suspicious DLLs.
    
  - **Review Process Activity:** Utilize EDR solutions to track process creation events following registry modifications. Investigate any unexpected processes that may have leveraged the IME to load the detected DLLs into memory.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Inspect network connections for any outbound traffic from newly initiated processes. This can identify communication with external command and control servers that may result from the execution of the malicious DLL.
  - **Check for Associated Alerts:** Correlate with existing alerts in your SIEM for related activities, including unusual process behavior or multi-step attack patterns that might point to wider exploitation of system components like IMEs.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with high severity due to the potential for significant impact from unauthorized DLL execution, which could lead to system compromise or data exfiltration in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate IME usage is common since many business applications require these functionalities for users speaking languages that employ complex characters. Additionally, attackers might obfuscate or rename their DLL files to features less likely to trigger this alert. The rule also assumes that any legitimate registry entries for IMEs using common extensions are benign, which could lead to false negatives if an attacker compromises an existing valid IME.

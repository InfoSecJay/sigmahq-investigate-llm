title: Potential Persistence Via Custom Protocol Handler
id: fdbf0b9d-0182-4c43-893b-a1eaab92d085
status: test
description: Detects potential persistence activity via the registering of a new custom
  protocole handlers. While legitimate applications register protocole handlers often
  times during installation. And attacker can abuse this by setting a custom handler
  to be used as a persistence mechanism.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential persistence mechanisms on Windows systems via the registration of custom protocol handlers. Attackers can abuse the legitimate functionality of custom protocol handlers, typically used by applications to handle specific URL schemes, as a means of maintaining access. The Sigma rule looks specifically for entries in the Windows Registry under `HKCR\`, focusing on new entries that begin with `URL:` and are not filtered out by standard Microsoft-related protocol handlers (which typically start with `ms-`). The detection relies primarily on Windows Registry logs, capturing the creation of potentially harmful or unauthorized protocol handlers that could enable persistent access for malicious entities. This activity corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112 (Modify Registry) as part of the defense evasion tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Recent Registry Changes:** Use a Registry monitoring tool or EDR platform to investigate the creation of new entries under `HKCR` that match the alert criteria and verify their legitimacy.
  - **Examine Associated Processes:** Check for any processes associated with the new protocol handlers by analyzing recent Windows process creation logs (Sysmon logs may be useful here).
  - **Look for Activity Correlating with User Behavior:** Investigate user activity during the timeframe of the alert for any unusual behavior or installations, which may indicate that the custom protocol handler was registered as part of legitimate application usage.
  - **Search for Related Network Activity:** Utilize network monitoring tools to check for any suspicious outbound connections initiated by the processes associated with the new protocol handlers, potentially indicating malicious use.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity due to the potential for misuse in establishing persistence mechanisms, which could lead to further exploitation. Swift investigation is crucial as it may indicate a compromise or a testerâ€™s exploration of attack vectors.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where an attacker registers a custom protocol handler without detectable registry modifications, such as in-memory injection or using privileged accounts to bypass logging. Additionally, if the attack is executed through legitimate applications with an established reputation, the EDR may mark the activity as benign. Analysts should also consider that high volumes of legitimate software installations could lead to false positives, necessitating tailored filters based on the organization's specific environment.

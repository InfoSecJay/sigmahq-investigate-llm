  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the deletion of the "Index" value associated with scheduled tasks in the Windows Registry, specifically targeting the registry path `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree\`. Removing the "Index" value effectively obscures the scheduled task from standard query tools such as `schtasks /query`, which could indicate an attempt at defense evasion by an adversary. The rule captures events classified as `DeleteKey` in the registry and aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for **Defense Evasion (T1562)**, as manipulating registry values can be a common tactic used to hide malicious activities from security tools.
  The data sources utilized for this detection are Windows registry logs, which provide insights into modifications made to the system configuration, particularly focusing on scheduled tasks. By monitoring these changes, SOC analysts can identify potentially malicious attempts to conceal persistence mechanisms or executables that are set to run on a schedule, hence enabling a proactive defense posture.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Logs**: Look for the corresponding registry delete events in the Windows Security Event Logs, particularly focusing on Event ID 4657, which indicates a registry key was changed.
  - **Check Scheduled Tasks**: Use the command `schtasks /query` to enumerate existing scheduled tasks and compare them against the known and expected configurations of the environment.
  - **Investigate Related Registry Changes**: Analyze recent registry changes or deletions that occurred around the same timestamp as the alert to identify any related suspicious activity.
  - **Cross-reference with EDR Data**: Utilize EDR tools to review process creation events around the time of the registry modification to scrutinize any associated processes that may hint at malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of medium is assigned to this alert due to the potential risk posed by attackers attempting to conceal their activities via scheduled tasks, which could lead to persistent threats if undetected.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The alert may not trigger if an attacker modifies the "Index" value without deleting it, as not all modifications lead to a delete event. Additionally, this rule assumes that all scheduled task manipulations will be logged correctly in the registry; however, certain techniques or misconfigurations might prevent logs from being generated. Furthermore, legitimate administrative actions could inadvertently cause false positives, leading to potential noise in alerts.

id: 41d1058a-aea7-4952-9293-29eaaf516465
status: test
description: Detects the deletion of AMSI provider registry key entries in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\AMSI.
  This technique could be used by an attacker in order to disable AMSI inspection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the deletion of specific registry keys associated with the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) on Windows systems. AMSI is a critical feature for enhancing security by allowing applications to scan data for potentially malicious content before executing it. The rule specifically monitors deletions of the keys within the registry path `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\AMSI` by correlating logs from Windows Registry delete events. When an attacker attempts to disable AMSI by removing these keys, they are effectively circumventing a vital layer of protection, making it easier to execute malicious payloads without detection. This behavior is related to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Defense Evasion** and the technique **T1562.001: Disable or Modify Tools**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Confirm Event Logs:** Review Windows Registry logs for the specific deletion events related to `IOfficeAntiVirus` and `ProtectionManagement.dll` to determine if they occurred unexpectedly.
  - **Cross-Reference with EDR:** Using your EDR solution, investigate the processes that attempted the registry deletions to understand if they are legitimate or potentially malicious.
  - **Assess Incident Context:** Examine the timeline surrounding the deletion entries for other suspicious activities, such as unusual process executions or network connections, to provide context to the findings.
  - **Check System Integrity:** Run a check for any other modifications in the registry that may further indicate an attempt to evade detection and assess if any other security controls were compromised or altered.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of AMSI in protecting against malicious code execution. The deletion of AMSI-related registry keys is a strong indicator of potential compromise and can lead to severe security incidents if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger under certain conditions where an attacker uses obscure methods to manipulate the registry without directly deleting these keys or uses permission sets that prevent logging. Additionally, if a legitimate tool or process performs the deletions (e.g., during system updates or application changes), it can lead to false negatives or false positives. Assumptions regarding the integrity of the logging capabilities must also be made, as disruptions in logging can prevent the detection of these malicious activities.

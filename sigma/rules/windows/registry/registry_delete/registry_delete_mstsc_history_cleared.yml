  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect unauthorized deletions of registry keys related to Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection history. The primary focus is on the deletion of entries that store the most recently used (MRU) connections, as well as specific server entries maintained in the registry path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client`. When an adversary attempts to conceal their tracks following a compromise or unauthorized access, they may clear this connection history to reduce the chances of detection. The technical data sources involved in this detection include Windows registry delete logs, specifically monitoring for events indicating the deletion of values or keys associated with RDP connections. This activity corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1070) and Indicator Removal on Host (T1112), where attackers aim to obscure their presence on a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Alert:** Check the Windows Security logs for related registry activity, particularly focusing on entries corresponding to the time the alert was triggered. Look for any patterns or unusual activity around the registry delete events.
  - **Review User Activity:** Inspect other logs such as Windows Event Logs (Security and Sysmon) for user authentication and process creation events during the timeframe of the alert to ascertain any suspicious account activity or unauthorized access.
  - **Cross-Reference with EDR Data:** Utilize the EDR tool to identify any process executions that coincide with the registry deletion events. This includes checking for RDP-related processes or any scripts that may have been executed around the time of the deletion.
  - **Investigate Related Network Activity:** Use network logs (NDR/NGFW) to review any outbound connections or tunneling attempts made by the userâ€™s device around the time of the event. Look for connections to known malicious IPs or unusual ports that may indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for malicious actors to erase evidence of their activities, indicating a significant security breach or an attempt to evade detection. This behavior warrants immediate investigation to assess the full extent of the compromise and implement appropriate containment measures.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry modifications occur outside the monitoring capabilities of the configured telemetry, such as in cases where file system logs are not implemented. Additionally, if an adversary uses different methods to clear RDP history (e.g., manually through a script or using tools that bypass normal event logging), detection may be evaded. Furthermore, legitimate administrative actions could potentially trigger false positives, leading to unnecessary investigations if not contextualized properly.

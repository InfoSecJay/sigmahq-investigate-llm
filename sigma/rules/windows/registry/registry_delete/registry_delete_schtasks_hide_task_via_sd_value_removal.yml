  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the illicit removal of Security Descriptor (SD) values from registry keys associated with the Windows Task Scheduler. Specifically, it monitors for delete operations targeting the registry path `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree\`, which is used to store scheduled tasks. Unauthorized manipulation of these Security Descriptors can be indicative of defense evasion tactics, as seen in the Tarrask malware. By deleting the SD values, an attacker can obscure scheduled tasks from legitimate users and security tools, allowing malicious actions to be executed without detection. This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562, which deals with defense evasion.
  The detection leverages the Windows registry delete event logs, particularly looking for deletions that pertain to security descriptor entries. The ability to identify such changes enables security teams to understand when an adversary attempts to conceal their automated tasks, enhancing overall visibility into potential malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Related Scheduled Tasks:** Review the scheduled tasks by querying the Task Scheduler. Look for any tasks with missing security descriptors that should otherwise exist.
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to examine any recent registry modifications. Focus on correlating time stamps related to the detected SD value deletions.
  - **Conduct a Threat Analysis:** Leverage EDR tools to analyze related endpoint behavior around the time the deletion occurred. Observe for processes or connections linked to the scheduled tasks for any abnormal activities.
  - **Investigate from Other Sources:** Use logs from the Proxy and NGFW to identify any unusual external communications that could relate to executing tasks that were hidden or tampered with due to the SD deletion.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as medium due to the potential for adversaries to conceal legitimate tasks, posing a significant risk to the integrity of the system and potentially indicating a broader compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where registry auditing is not enabled, or when the adversary uses techniques to create false tasks post-deletion that do not trigger further alerts. Additionally, if legitimate administrative changes are made to the registry without proper logging, this could also lead to missed detection. It's assumed that the environment is configured to monitor and alert for registry key changes effectively.

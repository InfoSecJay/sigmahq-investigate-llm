  Detects the enabling of the Windows Recall feature via registry manipulation. Windows Recall can be enabled by deleting the existing "DisableAIDataAnalysis" registry value.
  Adversaries may enable Windows Recall as part of post-exploitation discovery and collection activities.
  This rule assumes that Recall is already explicitly disabled on the host, and subsequently enabled by the adversary.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on monitoring changes to the Windows Registry, specifically looking for the deletion of the "DisableAIDataAnalysis" value within the WindowsAI key. The Windows Recall feature, when enabled, may allow adversaries to access sensitive information as part of their post-exploitation activities. By deleting this registry value, an adversary implicitly enables the Windows Recall feature, which could be exploited to gather data from the system. This rule utilizes Windows Registry event logs to track any unauthorized modifications, particularly in keys associated with WindowsAI settings. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Collection (T1113), as it allows adversaries to gather information that can be beneficial for further exploitation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Registry Changes:** Query Windows Registry logs to confirm the deletion of the "DisableAIDataAnalysis" value in both `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`. Document the context and timing of the change to understand potential malicious intent.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to investigate user actions around the time of the registry change, checking for anomalous behavior or processes that executed prior to the alert.
  - **Check for Related Artifacts:** Review additional logs such as Sysmon's process creation and network connection events to identify if there were any suspicious processes that may correlate with the registry modification.
  - **Consult Historical Data:** Search through Windows Event Logs (Security, System, and Application) to identify if the "DisableAIDataAnalysis" value had ever been previously modified or if there are any historical entries that indicate legitimate use.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with enabling the Windows Recall feature, which can lead to data exfiltration. A rapid investigation is essential to determine whether the change was legitimate or part of a malicious activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the Windows Recall feature is generally disabled before the modification, which may not hold true in all environments. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions or group policy changes could trigger similar registry modifications, potentially leading to false positives. If an adversary employs stealth techniques to alter the registry through means undetected by logging mechanisms, this rule may fail to trigger. Furthermore, absence of comprehensive monitoring of administrative actions may create gaps, allowing adversaries to cover up their tracks.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying suspicious activity related to the unauthorized execution of Sysinternals tools by monitoring registry key creation events, specifically the creation of the "accepteula" key. Legitimate use of Sysinternals tools typically involves proper file naming and expected registry key interactions. By looking for the creation of specific registry keys (e.g., `\PsExec\EulaAccepted`) associated with renamed executables, this rule captures potential misuse of these powerful utilities. The data sources leveraged include Windows Event Logs with a focus on registry change events, which record actions such as the creation of keys and values. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically addressing the tactic of resource development (T1588.002), where adversaries utilize legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Utilize the Windows Event Log to search for registry events around the time of alert detection. Look for the specific Event Type of "CreateKey" and the associated TargetObject indicating Sysinternals tool usage.
  - **Analyze Process Execution:** Use your EDR solution to trace back the process execution that triggered the registry event. Confirm whether any of the processes were executed with altered names or hashes, indicative of potential evasion attempts.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Examine Network Detection and Response (NDR) logs to identify any outbound communications from the renamed tools. Cross-reference the timing and destination IPs with known malicious indicators to evaluate the risk.
  - **Check Historical Context:** Investigate the system's history and user behavior surrounding the execution of the tool. Review application logs for anomalies in user actions or any signs of privilege escalation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been classified as high severity due to the significant risk associated with the misuse of Sysinternals tools, which are often used to bypass security measures and execute potentially harmful activities within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that renamed versions of Sysinternals tools will trigger the creation of registry keys as described. However, it may not fire if different nomenclature is employed by an adversary, or if the tools are executed without triggering the registry change events (e.g., using memory-resident methods). Additionally, environmental variations in the legitimate use of these tools may lead to false negatives, such as administrative activities that do not conform to expected patterns.

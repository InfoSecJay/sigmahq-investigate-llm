title: Potential Persistence Via Disk Cleanup Handler - Registry
id: d4f4e0be-cf12-439f-9e25-4e2cdcf7df5a
status: test
description: |
  Detects when an attacker modifies values of the Disk Cleanup Handler in the registry to achieve persistence.
  The disk cleanup manager is part of the operating system. It displays the dialog box [â€¦]
  The user has the option of enabling or disabling individual handlers by selecting or clearing their check box in the disk cleanup manager's UI.
  Although Windows comes with a number of disk cleanup handlers, they aren't designed to handle files produced by other applications.
  Instead, the disk cleanup manager is designed to be flexible and extensible by enabling any developer to implement and register their own disk cleanup handler.
  Any developer can extend the available disk cleanup services by implementing and registering a disk cleanup handler.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential persistence mechanisms employed by attackers by monitoring registry modifications related to the Disk Cleanup Handler on Windows systems. Attackers often exploit the flexibility of the Disk Cleanup Manager to register their handlers, which can then be used to achieve persistence by executing malicious code whenever the Disk Cleanup process runs. The rule specifically looks for the creation of new registry keys within the path `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\VolumeCaches\`, excluding several default keys that are typically added during regular system operations. The data sources leveraged for this rule include Windows Registry logs, capturing registry changes that could indicate suspicious activities. The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic is **Persistence**, with the technique focusing on modifying registry settings for persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the Registry Entries:** Navigate to the specified registry path to review any newly created keys. Verify whether these keys correlate with known malicious activity or unusual persistence methods.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Use Sysmon or EDR tools to review process creation logs that correlate with the timestamp of the registry modification. Look for processes related to disk cleanup or other suspicious executables during that timeframe.
  - **Audit Related Network Activity:** Inspect network connections and traffic logs around the time of the registry change to identify any unexpected outbound communication attempts or connections to known malicious hosts.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Alerts:** Review other security logs (e.g., EDR, AV) that may have triggered around the same time to identify if any other indicators of compromise are present in conjunction with the registry modification.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is considered medium due to the potential for an attacker to use legitimate Windows functionality for malicious purposes. This persistence technique can lead to exploited systems remaining undetected for extended periods.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate applications or updates modify the registry without correlating malicious behavior, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an attacker uses other, less-explored persistence methods or modifies less common registry entries, the rule may fail to detect those activities. The effectiveness of this rule also assumes that baseline registry changes are well understood in the environment; any undocumented legitimate changes could skew results and lead to missed detections.

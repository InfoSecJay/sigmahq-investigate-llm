  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of specific registry keys associated with the execution of potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) within the Sysinternals suite, such as PsExec, ProcDump, and others. These applications, while useful for legitimate administrative tasks, can also be exploited by adversaries to facilitate unauthorized access or execute malicious actions within an enterprise environment. The rule specifically looks for the event type `CreateKey` in Windows registry logs where the target object includes key names indicative of these Sysinternals tools, particularly filtering for entries that contain `EulaAccepted`. 
  The detection leverages Windows Security Event Logs, specifically focusing on registry modification events, allowing analysts to identify possible misuse of these powerful utilities. By monitoring for these key creations and utilizing the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1588.002 (Resource Development: Tool), security teams can proactively respond to unauthorized use of sensitive software that can aid in an attackerâ€™s lateral movement or privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Registry Logs**: Utilize Windows Security Event Logs to investigate the creation of registry keys found in the alert. Check for timestamps to correlate with user activity and other relevant logs to identify potential unauthorized access attempts. 
  - **Analyze Process Execution**: Use your EDR tool to search for processes initiated around the time the registry keys were created. Specifically, look for high-risk utilities like PsExec or ProcDump that may have been executed.
  - **Check User Context**: Validate the user account that executed the applications by correlating user behavior with Active Directory logs. Investigate if the user has legitimate permissions to run these tools and if their actions align with typical activities.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Inspect network logs for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts linked to the execution of suspected tools. Use NDR or firewall logs to highlight suspicious communication patterns that could signal malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity because the execution of Sysinternal tools, while not inherently malicious, can indicate potential misuse for unauthorized actions within the network. A rapid response is crucial to mitigate any potential risks associated with these powerful utilities being exploited by adversaries.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One limitation of this detection rule is the potential for false positives arising from the legitimate execution of Sysinternals tools by system administrators. The rule may not fire if these tools are executed in paths that have been whitelisted, or if logging is not adequately configured to capture all relevant registry events. Additionally, advanced adversaries may employ tactics to obfuscate their use of these tools, such as executing them through legitimate user accounts or modifying the registry keys under different names.

title: Suspicious Get Local Groups Information
id: cef24b90-dddc-4ae1-a09a-8764872f69fc
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
  Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activities related to the retrieval of local group information within Windows environments. Specifically, it monitors for the execution of the PowerShell commands `get-localgroup` and `Get-LocalGroupMember`, which adversaries often use to gather intelligence about user groups and their permissions on a system. Understanding local groups can help attackers identify users with elevated privileges, particularly if they spot users in privileged groups such as local administrators. The rule leverages Windows PowerShell module logs for its detection, particularly focusing on command payloads and contextual information to pinpoint these queries.
  This behavior corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Discovery tactic, under the technique T1069.001 (Permission Groups Enumeration), highlighting the importance of monitoring access to user group information as a potential precursor to further malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate the Alert**: Use EDR tools to check the specific user, timestamp, and system that triggered the alert. Look for patterns of behavior leading up to the command execution.
  - **Review Logs**: Examine Windows Event logs (Security, System) to cross-reference the PowerShell command with user activity. Determine if the command was executed by an authorized process or user.
  - **Check for Other Indicators**: Investigate logs from other sources such as AV and NGFW to see if there were any other suspicious activities around the same time, indicating a larger potential threat.
  - **User Context Review**: Assess the userâ€™s role and permissions within the organization. Determine if the user should be executing such commands or if this behavior is unexpected.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as "low" severity, indicating that while this behavior could signify reconnaissance efforts by an adversary, it may also stem from legitimate administrative actions or scripts by administrators. Each case should be assessed contextually.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if:
  - The PowerShell command is obfuscated or executed in a way that does not match the defined patterns.
  - Users are executing this command from a non-standard environment where logging is not as comprehensive, such as through a scheduled task or a remote session without proper logging.
  - Frequent legitimate use by administrators may lead to numerous false positives, making it crucial to correlate user behavior and role context.

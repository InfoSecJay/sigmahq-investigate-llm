title: AD Groups Or Users Enumeration Using PowerShell - PoshModule
id: 815bfc17-7fc6-4908-a55e-2f37b98cedb4
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may attempt to find domain-level groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of domain-level permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
  Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as domain administrators.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "AD Groups Or Users Enumeration Using PowerShell 
  - PoshModule" is designed to detect potential reconnaissance activities targeting Active Directory (AD) environments. Specifically, the rule monitors for suspicious execution commands that indicate attempts to enumerate domain-level groups and user permissions by leveraging PowerShell cmdlets such as `Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership` and `Get-ADUser`. These cmdlets are indicative of an adversary attempting to extract information about user groups and memberships, potentially revealing accounts with elevated permissions within the organization. 
  To effectively identify these actions, the rule relies on telemetry data sources, particularly Windows PowerShell logs. The key data points the rule watches for include command-line parameters and context information that specify the cmdlets being executed. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1069.001 (Account Discovery) under the tactic of Discovery, as adversaries may employ such enumeration to assess the security posture of an environment and identify high-value targets for further exploitation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check PowerShell Command History**: Review the PowerShell logs on affected systems for instances of `Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership` and `Get-ADUser` to confirm that the rules triggered are a result of suspicious behavior.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Cross-reference detected commands with user activities in EDR to determine whether the user has legitimate reasons for querying AD group memberships.
  - **Analyze User Roles**: Investigate the roles and permissions of users identified in the enumeration attempts to assess the potential impact of the identified activities on sensitive resources.
  - **Monitor for Similar Patterns**: Continuously monitor logs for similar patterns across other systems to identify potential lateral movement and further enumeration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as low severity because, while enumeration can be a precursor to more serious actions, it does not directly indicate malicious activity without further context. However, it should still be investigated as part of a broader threat-hunting effort.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in scenarios where PowerShell logging is not enabled or if adversaries use custom obfuscation techniques to mask their commands. Additionally, legitimate administrative users may perform similar queries for administrative tasks, leading to potential false positives. Understanding that detailed logging and user behavior analysis can help mitigate these blind spots is crucial for enhancing detection capabilities.

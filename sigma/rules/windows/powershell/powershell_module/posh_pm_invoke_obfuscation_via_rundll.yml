  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Invoke-Obfuscation RUNDLL LAUNCHER 
  - PowerShell Module" is designed to detect the execution of potentially obfuscated PowerShell scripts through the use of the `rundll32.exe` utility in Windows. Specifically, it looks for command line invocations that include both `rundll32.exe` and references to `shell32.dll`, alongside indications of PowerShell usage. This combination is often leveraged by attackers to conceal malicious activities under layers of obfuscation, making it difficult for traditional security measures to detect. The rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1027) and Execution (T1059.001), highlighting its relevance in identifying scoped evasion of prevention measures.
  The primary data sources utilized for this rule include Windows Security logs—especially process creation logs, which capture details such as the executable name, command-line arguments, and parent process information. By analyzing these logs, the detection engine can identify patterns that are characteristic of obfuscated PowerShell execution, thereby facilitating timely incident response.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to examine the process creation logs around the time of the alert, focusing on `rundll32.exe` instances, particularly those with unusual command-line parameters.
  - **Correlation with Sysmon Data:** Cross-reference Sysmon event logs to identify parent-child process relationships that may indicate a chain of malicious behavior, particularly focusing on instances where PowerShell was invoked by `rundll32.exe`.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Analyze network logs (NDR) for any outbound connections that correlate with the execution of the detected command, which may indicate data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication.
  - **Inspect Security and Application Logs:** Review Windows Security and Application logs for any related event IDs that may indicate a pattern of suspicious activity consistent with the detected behavior, such as failed logins or unusual application error logs.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for obfuscated PowerShell scripts to be indicative of more extensive malicious activities within the environment, necessitating timely investigation to prevent further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where PowerShell execution is heavily monitored and constrained or in cases where obfuscation techniques are sophisticated enough to completely conceal their activities from logs. Additionally, environments with custom security configurations or where users frequently utilize `rundll32.exe` legitimately may generate false positives. It is crucial for detection engineers to remain aware of these factors to enhance the rule’s efficacy and develop supplementary detection measures as needed.

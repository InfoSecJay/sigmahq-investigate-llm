  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify when the PowerShell command line uses the `Import-Module` cmdlet to load the `Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll` library. This module is commonly utilized to perform Active Directory (AD) enumeration, a technique that attackers may leverage to gather information about user accounts, groups, and other sensitive objects in an Active Directory environment. By monitoring for the specific strings associated with this cmdlet and DLL in the PowerShell command execution logs, the rule allows security teams to detect potential reconnaissance activity indicative of an unauthorized information-gathering attempt.
  The relevant technical data sources for this detection include PowerShell module logs and command-line parameters that detail executed commands. As this behavior relates to the objectives of discovery and reconnaissance in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactics of **Reconnaissance** (TA0043) and **Discovery** (TA0007), the detection rule aids in identifying scenarios where an attacker may be assessing network vulnerabilities or planning further intrusions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check the Windows PowerShell event logs for instances of the `Import-Module` cmdlet being executed alongside the `Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll` reference.
  - **Correlate with EDR Events:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to track any unusual process activity around the time the detection was triggered, especially focusing on user context and privileges.
  - **Examine Network Traffic:** Investigate recent network connections for the affected system to identify any outbound connections that align with AD enumeration practices or unusual internal requests.
  - **Assess User Privileges:** Verify the executing user's permissions to ensure that they align with legitimate administrative activity, thereby determining if there was any illegitimate access or use of privileges.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized at a medium severity level due to the potential for serious security implications if an unauthorized entity is attempting to enumerate Active Directory data, which could lead to a larger compromise of sensitive information.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses obfuscated or alternative command methods to access the Active Directory module, such as executing commands in a script or via direct invocation. Moreover, it operates under the assumption that PowerShell logging is enabled and properly configured on monitored endpoints. Situations where legitimate administrative activities are mistaken for malicious behavior can also lead to false positives, as authorized use of this functionality can occur during routine administrative tasks.

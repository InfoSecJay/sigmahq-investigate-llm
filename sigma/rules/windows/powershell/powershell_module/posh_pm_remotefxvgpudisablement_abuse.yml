description: Detects PowerShell module creation where the module Contents are set
  to "function Get-VMRemoteFXPhysicalVideoAdapter". This could be a sign of potential
  abuse of the "RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe" binary which is known to be vulnerable
  to module load-order hijacking.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.EXE Abuse 
  - PowerShell Module" is designed to detect potentially malicious activities involving the execution of PowerShell modules that may facilitate the abuse of the RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe binary. Specifically, it identifies instances where the contents of a PowerShell module include the function "Get-VMRemoteFXPhysicalVideoAdapter." This function's presence could indicate an attempt to exploit a known vulnerability related to module load-order hijacking. The primary technical data sources involved in this detection are PowerShell module logs, which capture the creation of PowerShell modules and their respective contents. In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this detection rule is related to the tactics of Defense Evasion under the technique ID T1218.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Examine the PowerShell module creation logs in the Windows Event Viewer, focusing on any entries that indicate unusual or unauthorized module activity related to RemoteFX.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Use EDR solutions to check for any PowerShell command executions that include suspicious parameters or that invoke the identified function within the detected modules.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Investigate alerts from the EDR regarding the execution of RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe or other PowerShell scripts that may correlate to user activity around the time of the alert.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Utilize NDR tools to analyze network traffic that coincides with the detection period, checking for anomalous connections or data exfiltration attempts which may indicate malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule's high-severity level is justified due to the potential of remote execution and exploitation of system vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access or control over virtualized environments, making this a critical issue in large enterprise environments.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several potential blind spots related to this rule. First, legitimate system management tasks that utilize similar PowerShell functions could result in false positives if not properly contextualized. Additionally, the detection may fail if the adversary uses obfuscation techniques or modifies the content structure to avoid triggering the rule. The reliability of the detection is contingent on consistent logging and monitoring of PowerShell actions; any gaps or delays in log collection could hinder effective alerting.

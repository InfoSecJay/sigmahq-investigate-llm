title: Suspicious Get Information for SMB Share - PowerShell Module
id: 6942bd25-5970-40ab-af49-944247103358
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for Collection and
  to identify potential systems of interest for Lateral Movement.
  Networks often contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file directories on various systems across a network.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the use of the `Get-SmbShare` PowerShell module command within a Windows environment. The `Get-SmbShare` command is employed by adversaries to enumerate shared folders and drives on a remote system, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of a cyber attack. By identifying shared resources, attackers can better plan their lateral movement and information collection strategies. The rule looks for the presence of the `Get-SmbShare` command either in the payload of executed commands or in context information logs. This context is crucial for understanding the behavior of users or potential attackers within the network.
  The information is gathered from Windows PowerShell logs, specifically filtering for events that indicate the execution of the `Get-SmbShare` command. This activity is classified under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Discovery" and technique "Network Share Discovery (T1069.001)," which highlights the reconnaissance attempts to gain visibility into shared resources on a network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Logs:** Check endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for any instances where `Get-SmbShare` was executed by a potentially unauthorized user or outside of expected administrative activities.
  - **Analyze PowerShell Logs:** Use Windows PowerShell logs to identify the user context and time of the executed `Get-SmbShare` command, noting any unusual patterns or anomalies.
  - **Inspect Network Shares:** Cross-reference the identified SMB shares with your organization's legitimate use cases to determine if the shares being queried are consistent with normal operational behavior.
  - **Assess User Accounts:** Investigate the account that executed the command for its role within the organization, looking for any signs of compromise or misuse, particularly if the account is not typically associated with administrative activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a low severity level, mainly because the execution of `Get-SmbShare` can also occur during regular administrative activities. However, it is essential to analyze the context and user permissions to determine if this behavior deviates from normal operations, warranting further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the command is executed using alternative methods or tools that bypass PowerShell logging, such as through a custom script or remotely using tools like PsExec. Additionally, it assumes that PowerShell logging is enabled and properly configured in the environment; therefore, in instances where logging is disabled, this rule may not capture the intended reconnaissance activities. Furthermore, administrators utilizing `Get-SmbShare` for legitimate purposes could generate false positives, thus necessitating a contextual analysis to differentiate between normal and suspicious activity.

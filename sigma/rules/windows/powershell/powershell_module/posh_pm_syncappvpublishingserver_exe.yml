  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for SyncAppvPublishingServer bypasses PowerShell execution restrictions by monitoring for the execution of the SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe process. This application is often leveraged by adversaries to evade security mechanisms that prevent unauthorized script execution. The main focus of the rule is to capture instances where this specific executable is initiated, typically indicating potential nefarious activity. The rule draws data from Windows PowerShell module logs where the context information contains the string "SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe." This allows security operations center (SOC) teams to identify and respond to potentially malicious behavior associated with the exploitation of legitimate tools and processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review EDR alerts to locate the execution path of the SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe process and examine any associated parent processes that may indicate malicious behavior.
  - Investigate process creation logs and correlate the timeline with other security events to determine if the execution aligns with known attack patterns or times of suspicious activity.
  - Search Proxy logs for any unusual outbound network connections made shortly after the execution of SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe, as this may indicate command and control (C2) activity.
  - Analyze Windows event logs for related events surrounding the execution, including user logins and other process activities, to gain a comprehensive view of the incident's context.

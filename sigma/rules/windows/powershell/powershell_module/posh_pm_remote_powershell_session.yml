  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect remote PowerShell sessions, specifically by analyzing the context of PowerShell module execution. It monitors for specific terms in the `ContextInfo`, looking for instances where the module is run in the context of the `wsmprovhost.exe`—a host application typically used for remote Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) tasks. Through this detection, the rule helps identify potential lateral movement or unauthorized remote access, correlating with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.001 (PowerShell). This rule leverages Windows event logs related to PowerShell modules, capturing crucial indicators of compromise in remote command executions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Examine Windows Security and Application logs for details on user activities surrounding the identified remote PowerShell sessions to understand the scope of the event.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Use EDR tools to trace the execution path of `wsmprovhost.exe` and any associated child processes to confirm if there's malicious activity stemming from the detected session.
  - **Network Correlation:** Investigate network logs for any unusual outbound connections related to the user’s remote PowerShell activities to identify potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - **Review System Changes:** Inspect any recent changes made to the system during the timeline of the detected session, checking for unauthorized modifications or installations of unexpected modules.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is prioritized as high severity due to the potential impact of unauthorized remote access and command execution. Such activities can lead to data breaches, lateral movement within the network, and compromised systems, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate remote PowerShell usage is common, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, it assumes that the context of the PowerShell execution is monitored effectively and that `wsmprovhost.exe` is not frequently misused by legitimate administrators, who may invoke it for valid reasons. An adversary might also employ obfuscation techniques that disguise their PowerShell commands, bypassing this detection mechanism.

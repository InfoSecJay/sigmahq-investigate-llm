  The Reset-ComputerMachinePassword cmdlet changes the computer account password that the computers use to authenticate to the domain controllers in the domain.
  You can use it to reset the password of the local computer.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious Computer Machine Password by PowerShell" focuses on detecting potentially nefarious use of the `Reset-ComputerMachinePassword` cmdlet in PowerShell. This cmdlet is designed to change the password of computer accounts used to authenticate against domain controllers. While it is a legitimate administrative function, abuse of this command may signify an attacker's attempt to manipulate domain trust relationships or engage in lateral movement within a network. The rule looks for instances where this command is executed and leverages Windows PowerShell logs as its primary data source. 
  In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this rule is associated with the **Initial Access** tactic (TA0001) and specifically the **Valid Accounts** technique (T1078). Adversaries could exploit the command to gain unauthorized access to the domain, potentially leading to a full compromise of sensitive information and control over the organization's IT infrastructure.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Command Logs:** Use EDR or PowerShell logs to locate instances of `Reset-ComputerMachinePassword`. Pay attention to the user context under which the command was executed and correlate with known activity patterns.
  - **Check User Account Activity:** Validate the legitimacy of the account executing the command. Look into the account's permissions, recent logins, and whether it is associated with administrative privileges.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Investigate outbound and inbound network connections to identify any suspicious or unexpected behavior following the execution of the cmdlet. Check for connections to uncommon or unauthorized domains.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Events:** Cross-reference the PowerShell execution with other logs (e.g., authentication logs, file changes, or event logs) to gain a broader understanding of the behavior surrounding this alert. Look for signs of lateral movement or privilege escalation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized changes to machine account passwords, which can enable attackers to impersonate legitimate devices for further malicious activities within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  A significant blind spot for this rule involves legitimate administrative tasks, as benign administrators may also run the `Reset-ComputerMachinePassword` cmdlet for maintenance purposes. Further, if an adversary utilizes administrative credentials to execute the command, the activity may blend in with normal operations, thus increasing the likelihood of evading detection. Additionally, if PowerShell logging is disabled or improperly configured, the rule will not trigger as expected. Adversaries may bypass detection by using alternative methods for credential manipulation, thus reinforcing the need for comprehensive monitoring and multi-layered defensive strategies.

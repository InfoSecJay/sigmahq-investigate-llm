  ### Technical Context
  The "Nslookup PowerShell Download Cradle" detection rule identifies potentially malicious use of PowerShell that leverages the nslookup command to perform DNS-based data exfiltration or payload delivery. By analyzing command-line arguments associated with PowerShell processes, this rule looks for specific patterns indicating the use of nslookup with queries for HTTP-related DNS TXT records. This behavior is notable because adversaries can use it to extract malicious payloads disguised within DNS responses, a technique often employed to bypass traditional security measures.
  This detection relies on telemetry from Windows systems, primarily focusing on process creation logs where PowerShell is invoked. The rule captures commands that contain the keywords 'nslookup' alongside various query types for DNS TXT records. This technique aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic "Execution" and the technique "Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows PowerShell" (ATT&CK ID T1059.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Investigate the corresponding EDR alerts triggered by this rule to assess any actions taken by the PowerShell process, including parent processes and command-line arguments executed.
  - **Review DNS Query Logs:** Query DNS logs to trace whether the flagged nslookup commands resulted in any DNS queries for potentially malicious domains, as well as inspecting the responses received.
  - **Analyze PowerShell Logs:** Examine PowerShell operational logs for further context regarding the PowerShell session, including any preceding commands that may indicate a larger attack context or persistence mechanisms.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Utilize NDR tools to investigate any unusual outbound traffic patterns associated with the identified hosts, especially focusing on connections to unauthorized or suspicious domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity due to its potential for data exfiltration or malware delivery, which could compromise sensitive information or lead to further exploitation within the network if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  It is important to note that this rule may not fire if the attacker uses obfuscation techniques for PowerShell commands or employs different mechanisms for DNS queries that do not match the specified patterns. Additionally, environments with restrictive firewall or DNS configurations might not log all DNS queries adequately, leading to missed detections. Assumptions are made that there are no alterations to standard command-line behavior of PowerShell and that DNS logging is adequately enabled.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects attempts to delete Volume Shadow Copies via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) using PowerShell commands. Specifically, it looks for the execution of PowerShell scripts that include `Get-WmiObject` and `Remove-WmiObject` or `Delete()` method calls on the `Win32_ShadowCopy` class. Volume Shadow Copies are a feature in Windows that allows for the creation of backup copies or snapshots of computer files or volumes, which can be critical for data recovery. By monitoring the process creation and PowerShell command execution logs, particularly from Sysmon, this rule aims to identify potential malicious activities that could lead to data loss or obstruct forensic investigations. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Impact and technique T1490, which pertains to the deletion of backup data to disrupt recovery efforts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify PowerShell Execution Context:** Check the PowerShell command execution logs to ascertain the context of the execution, including the user and the time of the activity. Determine if the execution aligns with authorized administrative actions.
  - **Assess System Event Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs for any related activity in the Security, System, or Application logs that may correlate with the deletion of Shadow Copies. Look for unusual or unauthorized behavior around the same timeframe.
  - **Inspect for Persistence Mechanisms:** Investigate if there are any other indicators of compromise on the host, such as unexpected scheduled tasks or startup scripts that might suggest a more extensive compromise related to data manipulation.
  - **Cross-reference with Endpoint Data:** Utilize EDR solutions to gain insights into the processes and files accessed around the time of the PowerShell command execution. Look for any indicators of lateral movement or additional commands executed.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as high severity in the enterprise environment due to the potential for significant data loss associated with the unauthorized deletion of Volume Shadow Copies, which could severely hinder incident response efforts and recovery operations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if the adversary uses obfuscated commands or alternate methodologies that do not include the specified WMI commands. Additionally, if legitimate administrative accounts perform the deletion of Shadow Copies during maintenance activities, these actions could generate false positives. The detection relies heavily on the presence of PowerShell logging, which may not be enabled in all environments, creating blind spots for analysis.

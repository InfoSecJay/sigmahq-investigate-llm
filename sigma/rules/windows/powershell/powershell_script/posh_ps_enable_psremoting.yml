  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Enable Windows Remote Management" is designed to detect the use of PowerShell scripts that enable Windows Remote Management (WinRM) using the cmdlet `Enable-PSRemoting`. This command is commonly utilized by administrators to allow remote command execution on Windows systems, but it can also be leveraged by adversaries with valid accounts to facilitate lateral movement within a network. The rule specifically monitors PowerShell script block logs, which must have script block logging enabled for detection to occur, to identify instances where the command is invoked. The detected activity is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of lateral movement (specifically, technique T1021.006), highlighting the potential for unauthorized remote interactions on Windows systems. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check the PowerShell script block logs for instances of the `Enable-PSRemoting` command and the context in which it was executed, including the user account and timestamp.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate the user activity of the account that executed the command. Ensure it aligns with normal behavior patterns and determine if the account was used for any suspicious actions or has a history of administrative commands.
  - **Assess Network Traffic:** Utilize the EDR or network monitoring tools to analyze traffic originating from the affected endpoint. Look for unauthorized WinRM connections or unusual network activity that may suggest lateral movement.
  - **Evaluate Security Controls:** Verify that security controls are in place to monitor and log events associated with remote management. Check for proper alert configurations and compliance to ensure any future remote command executions are flagged appropriately.
  ### Prioritization
  The elevated priority for this alert is warranted given that enabling WinRM can create significant security risks by allowing attackers to execute commands remotely, potentially leading to a compromise of multiple systems across the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that script block logging is already enabled, which may not be the case in all environments. Additionally, legitimate administrative use of the `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet may result in false positives. Also, if an adversary executes this command using obfuscation techniques or through other means (like modifying logging settings), the rule may fail to detect the activity.

title: Change User Agents with WebRequest
id: d4488827-73af-4f8d-9244-7b7662ef046e
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
  Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potentially malicious activities that use the `Invoke-WebRequest` PowerShell command with a modified user agent string. Adversaries often blend malicious command and control (C2) traffic with legitimate web traffic to evade detection by security systems. By modifying the user agent, they can obscure the nature of their requests and communicate commands to remote systems in a manner that resembles normal web activity. This rule inspects PowerShell script block logging data, specifically looking for the presence of the `Invoke-WebRequest` command alongside the `-UserAgent` parameter, which suggests an attempt to conceal the actual purpose of the web request.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the PowerShell script block logs through EDR to identify the specific execution context of the detected `Invoke-WebRequest` commands.
  - Analyze the associated command-line parameters and user agent string for anomalies or known malicious indicators that may provide insight into the intent behind the requests.
  - Correlate findings with network traffic logs to determine whether the web requests were directed towards suspicious or known malicious domains.
  - Use threat intelligence feeds to investigate the reputation of any URLs or endpoints contacted and assess if there were any previous detections or reported incidents involving the identified user agent strings.

title: Change User Agents with WebRequest
id: d4488827-73af-4f8d-9244-7b7662ef046e
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
  Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Change User Agents with WebRequest" Sigma rule aims to detect potentially malicious activities where adversaries manipulate the User-Agent HTTP header to blend in with ordinary web traffic. This technique is often employed to exfiltrate data or maintain command and control communication while evading security controls. The detection logic for this rule specifically targets Windows PowerShell script executions that invoke the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet with user-defined User-Agent strings. By leveraging script block logging, security teams can identify these instances when PowerShell scripts are executed, offering insight into possible nefarious activities matching MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols).
  To effectively monitor for this behavior, the rule analyzes the content of executed PowerShell scripts for the presence of 'Invoke-WebRequest' and the explicit '-UserAgent' parameter. When combined, the detection of this specific command indicates that a script may be attempting to manipulate its HTTP requests, which may warrant further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **EDR Review:** Examine the EDR alerts for the specific host involved to review the execution history of PowerShell scripts associated with the flagged User-Agent change. Focus on identifying what other processes may have been executed by the same user.
    
  - **Log Correlation:** Cross-reference Windows Security and Sysmon logs to identify any other unusual or suspicious activities around the same timeframe, including failed logins or abnormal process creations.
    
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Use Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to analyze the outgoing traffic from the affected host, paying particular attention to any unusual HTTP requests or connections to known malicious IP addresses.
    
  - **Context Gathering:** Investigate the user account associated with the alert to determine whether it has administrative privileges and if it has a history of anomalous behavior, aiding in the risk assessment of the potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity because, while manipulating the User-Agent string can signify sophisticated adversarial behavior, it might also include non-malicious use cases such as legitimate automation scripts or testing environments. As such, further context is essential to ascertain the true risk.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that Script Block Logging is enabled, which may not be the case across all environments. Additionally, an adversary may avoid detection by using known User-Agent strings or other common web traffic patterns, which can lead to false negatives. If a PowerShell script does not include the `-UserAgent` parameter, or if the scripting is obfuscated in a way that avoids direct detection, this rule may fail to trigger an alert.

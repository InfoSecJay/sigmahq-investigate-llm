  Adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.
  This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect attempts by adversaries to identify whether their malicious activity is occurring within a virtualized environment, such as a sandbox or virtual machine. Adversaries may utilize PowerShell commands to query specific system information indicative of virtualization artifacts, allowing them to change behaviors or evade deeper scrutiny during their malicious operations. The rule focuses primarily on Script Block Logging of PowerShell sessions, specifically looking for the presence of the `Get-WmiObject` (or its alias `gwmi`) command, along with checks for specific WMI classes such as `MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature` and `Win32_ComputerSystem`. The underlying data sources include Windows Event Logs, specifically PowerShell logs where Script Block Logging has been enabled. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1497.001, which addresses defense evasion strategies.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check the Windows PowerShell logs for the execution of the `Get-WmiObject` or `gwmi` commands, focusing on any related script block entries, to confirm the context of their usage.
  - **Analyze Script Block Logging Output:** Utilize your SIEM to analyze the output of Script Block Logging for any occurrences that match the specified criteria, particularly focusing on the modules related to virtualization detection.
  - **Correlate with Other Data Sources:** Cross-reference findings with EDR telemetry to detect if the detected PowerShell script execution corresponds to any unusual process behaviors or if it was executed under suspicious user accounts.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic Logs:** Look for any associated network connections that may reveal data exfiltration or communication with command-and-control servers following the execution of the scripts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity as detection of virtualization environment checks may indicate preparation for further adversarial actions. Response teams should treat this with urgency to prevent any potential evasion techniques that may be part of a larger compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the assumption that Script Block Logging is enabled on all relevant systems; if it is disabled, the detection rule will not trigger. Additionally, advanced adversaries may use obfuscation or encoding techniques in PowerShell that could evade detection by this rule. Notably, depending on the configuration of other security measures (such as EDR response settings), the attempt to detect these checks may also be thwarted.

  Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information.
  Files containing email data can be acquired from a users local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Powershell Local Email Collection" detection rule focuses on identifying potential adversarial activity targeting user email data on local systems. Specifically, it looks for the execution of PowerShell scripts that interact with Microsoft Outlook or manipulate Outlookâ€™s data objects, such as obtaining mail items from local storage. The rule captures occurrences of script block logs that include command text indicative of email data collection, such as `Get-Inbox.ps1` or use of the Outlook COM object through PowerShell commands. In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this rule pertains to the "Collection" tactic and specifically the technique T1114.001, which involves gathering email data from local sources.
  To effectively detect this behavior, the rule relies on Windows PowerShell script block logging, which must be enabled in the environment for the rule to function correctly. This logging enables the capture of significant command invocations and payloads executed in PowerShell, helping analysts recognize when potentially sensitive operations concerning users' email are being performed.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check the PowerShell script block logs for instances where the specific strings identified in the rule were executed, focusing on timestamps corresponding to the alert.
    
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate processes that initiated the PowerShell commands, noting any unusual parent-child relationships or unexpected execution contexts.
  - **Examine Email File Locations:** Conduct a search in common Outlook data storage locations or cache files on the affected machine to identify any unauthorized access or export of email data.
  - **Cross-reference User Activity:** Review proxy and VPN logs to correlate any unusual user activity during the time of the alert, especially focusing on external connections or file downloads that coincide with the PowerShell execution.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity due to the potential compromise and exfiltration of sensitive information, particularly personal or corporate email data. Prompt investigation is essential to ascertain the scope and intent of such actions, given the sensitivity of the data involved.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule is contingent upon the correct configuration of PowerShell script block logging; if logging is not enabled, the detection will not trigger. Additionally, attackers may utilize alternative scripting methods or obfuscation techniques not captured by the keywords in this rule, potentially avoiding detection. It's also assumed that users have not modified their Outlook configurations or script permissions in ways that would inhibit detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify suspicious use of the PowerShell `Add-Content` cmdlet, which can be used to modify user profile scriptsâ€”potentially allowing attackers to establish persistence on compromised systems. The rule specifically looks for script blocks that contain references to `Add-Content $profile`, alongside other commands that may indicate malicious intent, such as invoking web requests or executing processes. Technical data sources relevant to this detection include Windows PowerShell logs, specifically with Script Block Logging enabled, which captures detailed information regarding PowerShell execution. By monitoring these logs, analysts can quickly identify and respond to attempts to embed malicious commands into user profiles, falling under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of persistence (T1546.013) and privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Malicious Activity**: Utilize the EDR tool to review the endpoints for any abnormal PowerShell activity, focusing on the timeline and the context surrounding the script block that triggered the alert.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs**: Examine relevant Windows PowerShell logs for additional details or patterns that indicate the legitimacy of the PowerShell script or its execution context.
  - **Analyze User Profile Changes**: Investigate any modifications in user profiles, especially in locations typically used for persistence, such as the PowerShell profile script.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Use network logs to identify any outbound connections made by the system at the time of the suspicious PowerShell execution, particularly those related to remote content requests.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity of this alert indicates a noteworthy risk of unauthorized persistence mechanisms that could lead to elevated privileges and further exploitation within the enterprise network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if Script Block Logging is disabled, leading to a lack of visibility into malicious PowerShell execution. Furthermore, legitimate administrative scripts could trigger false positives; therefore, it's essential for analysts to assess the context of the detected activity. Adversaries may also obfuscate their commands or utilize alternative methods to execute similar persistence techniques, circumventing detection mechanisms.

  Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser.
  Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future.
  Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Access to Browser Login Data" detection rule is designed to identify when an adversary attempts to access stored login credentials from popular web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge. These browsers typically secure credentials in specific file locations and encrypted formats, which if accessed improperly, can lead to credential theft. The rule looks for malicious PowerShell commands containing dangerous operations such as `Copy-Item` directed at paths known to store browser login data. This context highlights how PowerShell can be misused to access sensitive information under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1555.003 (Credentials from Web Browsers). To effectively trigger this rule, the telemetry collection must have PowerShell script block logging enabled in order to capture relevant script activity and parameters.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Investigate endpoints that generated the alert for any related PowerShell scripts, focusing on their command history and process tree to determine legitimacy.
  - **Review Process Creation Events**: Use Windows Event Logs to find related process creation events that may correlate with the PowerShell commands identified, paying special attention to the parent-child relationship in the process tree.
  - **Analyze User Activity**: Review logs for user authentication and browser usage patterns around the time of the alert to identify any abnormal account activity that may point to compromised credentials.
  - **Examine Network Activity**: Query network connection logs for any unusual external communications or access to assets that could indicate a data exfiltration attempt post-credential access.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for significant impact if an adversary gains unauthorized access to user credentials; this could result in further cybersecurity threats, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PowerShell script block logging is enabled, as it is critical for capturing evidence of malicious activity. If logging is not enabled or if an adversary employs alternative means (e.g., different scripting languages or direct API calls) to access browser data, the detection may fail to trigger. Additionally, legitimate users may access these paths for valid reasons, which could lead to false positives, particularly if multiple users share the same devices or profiles.

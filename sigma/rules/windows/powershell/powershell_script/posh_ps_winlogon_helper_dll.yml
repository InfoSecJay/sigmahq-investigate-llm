title: Winlogon Helper DLL
id: 851c506b-6b7c-4ce2-8802-c703009d03c0
status: test
description: |
  Winlogon.exe is a Windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
  Registry entries in HKLM\Software[Wow6432Node]Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ and HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ are
  used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon. Malicious modifications to these Registry keys may cause Winlogon to
  load and execute malicious DLLs and/or executables.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Winlogon Helper DLL" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious modifications to the Windows Registry that may compromise user authentication by altering the behavior of the Winlogon component. Winlogon.exe is critical for managing user logins and logouts, including the Secure Attention Sequence activated by Ctrl-Alt-Delete. The rule specifically monitors PowerShell script execution logs for any commands that modify key registry entries located in `HKLM\Software[Wow6432Node]Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` and `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`. It looks for the use of cmdlets `Set-ItemProperty` and `New-Item`, which are often leveraged by attackers to inject malicious DLLs into the Winlogon process, thereby inserting persistence mechanisms into the system. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Persistence and Technique: T1547.004, focusing on the manipulation of registry keys to establish ongoing access to the compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check PowerShell Logs:** Review PowerShell logs for entries matching the script block conditions that triggered the alert. Pay close attention to the timestamps and originating user accounts to identify unauthorized activity.
    
  - **Examine Registry Changes:** Use tools like Windows Registry Editor or PowerShell cmdlets to check the specified registry keys. Look for recent modifications that do not align with normal operational behavior and identify the user or process responsible for them.
    
  - **Analyze Running Processes:** Utilize EDR to list processes running on affected systems at the time of alert generation. Investigate any suspicious processes that may have been spawned as a result of the changes made to the registry.
  - **Cross-Reference with Other Logs:** Consult additional logs from security appliances, such as firewall and VPN logs, to identify unusual login attempts or connections that coincide with the modifications detected by the rule. This helps to paint a broader picture of potential exploitation.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the critical role of Winlogon in user authentication and system security, alerts triggered by this rule are classified as medium severity. Prompt investigation is essential, as malicious alterations here can lead to persistent unauthorized access and compromise sensitive data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PowerShell Script Block Logging is enabled in the environment; if itâ€™s disabled, the rule may not trigger. Additionally, if attackers use alternative methods (such as directly modifying the registry without utilizing PowerShell), this rule would fail to detect those activities. There is an assumption that normal user behavior does not include frequent modifications to Winlogon-related registry entries, which may not always hold true in environments with legitimate administrative tasks.

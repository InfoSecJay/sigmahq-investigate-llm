  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potentially malicious usage of the `New-PSDrive` PowerShell cmdlet, which can be used by adversaries to establish a connection to a remote network share via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The cmdlet creates a new drive that maps to a specified folder on this share, effectively allowing the attacker to interact with the remote share as if it were a local resource. Key indicators that the rule looks for include the presence of parameters indicating a filesystem provider, a root that points to a network path (e.g., `\\server\share`), and the use of administrative shares (e.g., `$`). The rule relies on process creation logs with script block logging enabled, capturing the script block text of executed PowerShell scripts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review PowerShell execution logs in your EDR solution to identify the context in which the `New-PSDrive` command was executed, focusing on the associated user account and time of execution.
  - Cross-reference the SMB connections during the same timeframe in your network tools to identify any suspicious file access patterns or unauthorized access to administrative shares.
  - Examine any command-line arguments and associated processes that executed the PowerShell command to understand if they correlate with known malicious activity or anomalous behavior.
  - Check relevant system and security event logs in the Windows Event Viewer for any indicators of lateral movement or privilege escalation that may align with the execution of the `New-PSDrive` command.

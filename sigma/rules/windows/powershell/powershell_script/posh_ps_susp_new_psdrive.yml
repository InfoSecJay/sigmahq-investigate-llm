  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Suspicious New-PSDrive to Admin Share" is designed to identify potential lateral movement activity by adversaries within a Windows environment using PowerShell. Specifically, it looks for instances where the PowerShell command `New-PSDrive` is invoked with parameters that indicate an attempt to map a remote network share (administrative shares) via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The rule captures specific keywords associated with the `New-PSDrive` cmdlet, ensuring that the command attempts to create a filesystem drive mapped to a remote path that may be indicative of malicious activity. 
  This behavior is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques related to lateral movement, specifically T1021.002, which refers to the use of SMB for interacting with remote shares. The primary data source used for this detection is PowerShell script block logs, which must be enabled to log script execution details. By monitoring these logs for the specified command patterns, the SOC can identify suspicious attempts to access administrative shares that may indicate unauthorized or malicious lateral movement within the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify PowerShell Execution Context:** Check the event logs for the execution history of PowerShell commands, particularly focusing on the user context that executed the `New-PSDrive` command to establish if it aligns with known user activity.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Utilize EDR or network traffic logs to identify additional SMB traffic that corresponds with the timestamps of the alerts. Look for any anomalous connections to administrative shares from unexpected hosts.
  - **Check for Script Block Logging:** Confirm that PowerShell script block logging is functioning correctly in your environment. Review the logs for related events before and after the alert to check for any malicious patterns or additional commands executed.
  - **Review User Access Rights:** Assess the permissions of the user account that triggered the alert. Investigate whether this account should typically access admin shares and identify any recent changes that might indicate privilege escalation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential indication of lateral movement within the network. This type of behavior could lead to data exfiltration or further unauthorized access, making it a significant alert that warrants timely investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PowerShell script block logging is enabled in the environment; if it is not, the rule will not fire, potentially missing important indicators of lateral movement. Additionally, the detection may be circumvented if an adversary obfuscates their PowerShell commands or uses other methods to access shares. Consequently, there might be scenarios where legitimate administrative tasks may generate similar alerts, leading to false positives that require further contextual investigation.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious IO.FileStream" identifies potential misuse of PowerShell by monitoring for the creation of an `IO.FileStream` object that accesses drive volumes through the `\\.\` device path. This can indicate an attacker trying to bypass traditional file access methods to read raw data from disk volumes, which could be linked to various malicious activities, including data exfiltration or stealthy malware operations. The relevant telemetry for this detection primarily involves PowerShell Script Block Logging; thus, the alert triggers when a PowerShell script invokes the creation of a file stream with the specified attributes.
  This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1070.003, which focuses on “Indicator Removal on Host.” Adversaries frequently utilize such methods to evade detection and to manipulate or interact with data in a way that avoids standard event logging mechanisms. Analysts should be particularly vigilant when this alert triggers, as it may denote illicit attempts to access sensitive data directly from a storage medium.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Execution Context:** Review the event logs for the PowerShell process that triggered the alert. Ensure that PowerShell execution policies and script block logging are enabled and examine which user executed the script.
  - **Analyze the Script Block:** Extract the complete PowerShell script block associated with the detection. Assess the purpose of the script and identify any other commands or parameters that could signify malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with EDR Logs:** Use your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to analyze the process tree related to the PowerShell execution. Look for any suspicious child processes or unusual behavior that could indicate further compromise.
  - **Review System and Security Logs:** Check Windows Security, System, and Application logs for related events that may provide context around the time of the alert. Identify any recent logins, changes, or other suspicious activities generally correlated with the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  A medium severity level is assigned to this detection, due to the potential for abuse by adversaries exploiting PowerShell for direct drive access, leaving systems vulnerable to data leaks and unauthorized operations. Immediate investigation is imperative to ascertain if this behavior is indicative of a broader compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under the following assumptions:
  - Script Block Logging may be disabled or improperly configured, preventing the capture of relevant PowerShell activities.
  - Legitimate scripts using `IO.FileStream` may result in false positives, requiring manual correlation to evaluate true threats.
  - Adversaries could use obfuscation techniques to hide the use of `IO.FileStream`, bypassing detections where standard signatures are utilized.
  Analysts should understand these limitations and consider complementary detection measures to enhance overall monitoring effectiveness.

title: Suspicious Get Local Groups Information - PowerShell
id: fa6a5a45-3ee2-4529-aa14-ee5edc9e29cb
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
  Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the use of PowerShell commands that are commonly used by adversaries to discover information about local system groups and their permissions. Specifically, it looks for command invocations that include `Get-LocalGroup`, `Get-LocalGroupMember`, and queries made via `Get-WMIObject` for `Win32_Group`. The underlying data sources for this detection are PowerShell script block logs, which must be enabled in the environment for this rule to function properly. By analyzing these logs, the rule can highlight potential reconnaissance behavior, correlating with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Discovery (T1069.001) related to discovering local groups.
  Adversaries are likely interested in identifying users with elevated permissions, such as those in the local administrators group, which can inform their subsequent actions within the environment. This detection is crucial for maintaining visibility into activities that may indicate preparation for further attacks, including privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Examine PowerShell script block logs for the presence of commands like `Get-LocalGroup` and `Get-LocalGroupMember` to determine if they were executed during suspicious activity.
    
  - **Correlate with User Behavior:** Assess the account that executed the PowerShell commands by cross-referencing user activity in EDR logs to ascertain if it aligns with typical behavior or if it appears anomalous.
  - **Inspect System Group Memberships:** Utilize the Windows Security logs to verify the current group memberships for users and look for any unauthorized access assignments or unusual group memberships.
  - **Check for Prior Alerts:** Review historical logs and alerts for recurring use of these commands, which can indicate ongoing reconnaissance or a pattern of behavior that may require further investigation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as low severity due to its nature, primarily focusing on reconnaissance rather than immediate malicious activity. However, it still warrants investigation to ascertain whether it forms part of a broader opportunistic or targeted attack strategy.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One limitation of this detection rule is the assumption that script block logging is enabled; if it is not, this rule will not generate alerts. Additionally, legitimate system administrators might run these commands for administrative tasks, potentially leading to false positives. An adversary may also adopt obfuscation techniques or alternative command formats to evade detection, which means that the effectiveness of this rule may be diminished in these scenarios.

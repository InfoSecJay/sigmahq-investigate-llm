  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the usage of the PowerShell `Set-Mailbox` cmdlet, which is commonly used in Microsoft Exchange environments to configure mailbox settings, including setting up SMTP forwarding rules. The rule specifically looks for script block text that includes `Set-Mailbox`, along with parameters like `-DeliverToMailboxAndForward` and `-ForwardingSmtpAddress`. When these artifacts are present, it indicates a potential attempt to forward emails, a tactic often exploited during exfiltration attacks. The detection utilizes telemetry from Windows PowerShell scripts with the requirement that Script Block Logging is enabled to capture the relevant activities. This alerts analysts under the MITRE ATT&CK frameworkâ€™s exfiltration tactic (T1041).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check PowerShell Logs:** Review PowerShell script block logs for additional context around the execution of the `Set-Mailbox` cmdlet, focusing on preceding commands, user accounts, and execution time.
  - **Evaluate User Activity:** Investigate the actions of the user or service account that executed the cmdlet. Determine if the user has legitimate reasons for making changes to email forwarding settings.
  - **Analyze Mailbox Configuration:** Access mailbox settings from the Exchange admin center to confirm if any unexpected forwarding rules have been established, including the destination of forwarded emails.
  - **Review Security Alerts:** Correlate findings with security alerts from EDR and AV solutions to check for any related malicious activity or known threat actor behaviors surrounding this event.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is set to medium as it indicates potentially malicious behavior that could lead to unauthorized email forwarding, aiming to exfiltrate sensitive information. Further investigation is essential to confirm whether this activity is legitimate or part of a larger attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire in cases where Script Block Logging is not enabled, which is crucial for capturing PowerShell activity. Additionally, legitimate administrative use of PowerShell for email forwarding can lead to false positives. Engineers should consider that advanced adversaries may employ obfuscation techniques to circumvent detection or use other methods to forward emails without invoking the `Set-Mailbox` cmdlet.

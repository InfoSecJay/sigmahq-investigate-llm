title: Potential Packet Capture Activity Via Start-NetEventSession - ScriptBlock
id: da34e323-1e65-42db-83be-a6725ac2caa3
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the execution of powershell scripts with calls to the "Start-NetEventSession" cmdlet. Which allows an attacker to start event and packet capture for a network event session.
  Adversaries may attempt to capture network to gather information over the course of an operation.
  Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potential Packet Capture Activity Via Start-NetEventSession 
  - ScriptBlock" identifies the execution of PowerShell scripts that invoke the "Start-NetEventSession" cmdlet. This cmdlet enables the initiation of event and packet capture for network sessions, potentially leveraged by adversaries to collect sensitive data traveling over the network, such as user credentials sent through unencrypted protocols. To function effectively, this rule relies on Script Block Logging, which must be enabled to capture detailed information about the executed PowerShell commands. The primary data sources inspected by this rule are Windows PowerShell logs, which provide insights into the context and content of PowerShell executions. In accordance with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this rule is categorized under the tactics of "Credential Access" and "Discovery," reflecting the intent behind such network capture activities (Technique T1040).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze PowerShell Logs**: Review the relevant PowerShell logs in your SIEM or EDR for any recent executions of scripts that contain the "Start-NetEventSession" cmdlet to identify the source and context of the execution.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Creation**: Cross-reference process creation logs to see if the PowerShell instance was executed via a suspicious process or during unusual activity periods that might suggest covert operations.
  - **Check Network Traffic**: Utilize network monitoring solutions (NDR) to analyze any unusual traffic patterns or an increase in packet captures that correlate with the identified PowerShell execution.
  - **Assess User Activity**: Investigate user activity and roles associated with the execution to determine if the activity aligns with legitimate business operations or indicates potential malicious behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium priority due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized packet captures, which can lead to the compromise of sensitive information and user credentials. Any indication of misuse warrants immediate investigation to mitigate potential data breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One limitation of this detection rule is that it relies on Script Block Logging being enabled; without this logging, the activity may go undetected. Additionally, legitimate network diagnostic activities may generate false positives. Adversaries may also use obfuscation techniques or execute similar cmdlets under different contexts, which could evade detection by this rule. Understanding the context of PowerShell executions is vital for accurate interpretation and response.

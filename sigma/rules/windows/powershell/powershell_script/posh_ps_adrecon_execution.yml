  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PowerShell ADRecon Execution" is designed to detect the execution of the ADRecon PowerShell script, which is known to be utilized by the advanced persistent threat group FIN7 for Active Directory reconnaissance activities. This detection rule focuses on identifying key functions and output file names associated with the ADRecon script, such as "Get-ADRExcelComOb," "Get-ADRGPO," and "Get-ADRDomainController," as well as the output report named "ADRecon-Report.xlsx." To effectively capture this activity, organizations must ensure that PowerShell Script Block Logging is enabled, allowing for the monitoring of commands executed through PowerShell.
  The rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Discovery" and technique "Execution" (T1059.001), emphasizing the reconnaissance phase in which attackers gather information about the system and network topology. By leveraging PowerShell logs as a data source, incident responders can achieve a clearer picture of potentially malicious behavior targeting Active Directory environments, thus enhancing overall security posture.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Examine the PowerShell Script Block logs in the Security or Sysmon sections to identify instances of the detected ADRecon functions or report generation.
  - **Correlate with Alert Context:** Investigate the context of the alert by reviewing related network and endpoint events to determine if other tools were employed during the same timeframe.
  - **Validate User Activity:** Use EDR solutions to verify the identity of the user executing the script and analyze their behavior to establish whether this was a legitimate administrative action or malicious intent.
  - **Check for Related Artifacts:** Look for any created files such as "ADRecon-Report.xlsx" and assess their location and permissions to identify whether they are subsequently accessed or downloaded by unauthorized users.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been classified as high severity due to the script's connection with known advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, which indicates potential malicious intent to gather sensitive information that may lead to further compromise within an organization's infrastructure.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule's effectiveness is contingent upon the enabling of PowerShell Script Block Logging; if this setting is disabled, the detection may not trigger even if the ADRecon script is executed. Additionally, it's assumed that the environment does not have extensive script obfuscation or alternative execution methods that could disguise the use of PowerShell for reconnaissance. Adversaries could also employ similar nomenclature for benign scripts or use legitimate administrative tools to avoid detection.

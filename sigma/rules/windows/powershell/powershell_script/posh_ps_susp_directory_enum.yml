  ### Technical Context
  The "Powershell Directory Enumeration" rule is designed to detect the use of a specific PowerShell command sequence that is common in directory enumeration attacks, particularly those employed by the MAZE ransomware. This rule focuses on identifying the execution of PowerShell scripts that contain a combination of command parameters indicative of directory scanning activities, such as `foreach`, `Get-ChildItem` with the `-Path` option, error handling parameters like `-ErrorAction`, and output commands like `Out-File`. The primary data sources leveraged for this detection include PowerShell script block logs, which must be enabled within the Windows environment to provide the necessary telemetry. 
  By monitoring these script block logs, the detection rule can trigger alerts when potentially malicious enumeration scripts are executed. This activity is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under Tactic: Discovery and Technique: T1083 (File and Directory Discovery), which highlights its relevance to understanding and mitigating threats associated with file system reconnaissance.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Examine the PowerShell script block logs for the specific commands listed in the rule's detection criteria. Look for common indicators such as `Get-ChildItem` and any use of `Out-File`.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Creation Events:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate the identified PowerShell script execution with process creation events, checking for suspicious parent processes or unusual execution contexts.
    
  - **Assess User Activity:** Investigate the user who initiated the PowerShell command to determine if the user had appropriate permissions and access rights, and whether this behavior aligns with their usual activities.
    
  - **Check for Related Network Activity:** Use network logs to identify any outgoing communications from the infected host to external IP addresses or domains after the PowerShell enumeration command was executed, as this could suggest further malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as medium severity because while directory enumeration can be a precursor to more damaging actions, it may also be part of legitimate administrative tasks. Contextual investigation is crucial to determining the intent behind the activity.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot is the assumption that all legitimate PowerShell scripts will be completely benign; thus, false positives from routine administrative activities may occur. Moreover, if script block logging is not enabled, this detection rule will not fire, resulting in missed malicious activity. Adversaries may also use obfuscation techniques to hide their command intent, which could lead to the rule failing to capture the malicious actions effectively.

description: Detects PowerShell module creation where the module Contents are set
  to "function Get-VMRemoteFXPhysicalVideoAdapter". This could be a sign of potential
  abuse of the "RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe" binary which is known to be vulnerable
  to module load-order hijacking.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets potential abuse of the PowerShell script related to `RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.EXE`, specifically when the script block begins with the declaration of the function `Get-VMRemoteFXPhysicalVideoAdapter`. This is particularly relevant because the `RemoteFXvGPUDisablement` binary is known to be vulnerable and can be exploited via module load-order hijacking. The rule monitors script block logging, which captures the content of PowerShell script blocks, allowing for early detection of potentially malicious activities related to virtualization graphics handling. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic for this rule falls under **Defense Evasion**, specifically technique **T1218** (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), which describes how malicious actors may exploit trusted binaries to execute their code.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Command Context**: Check the EDR logs for the context in which the PowerShell script was executed, including user accounts, timestamps, and any preceding commands that might have led to this execution.
  - **Analyze Script Block Content**: Review additional script blocks within the same execution context to determine if similar patterns are present or if additional malicious functions have been defined or executed.
  - **Check for Related Processes**: Use the Process Creation logs to identify any processes spawned by the PowerShell instance that may indicate subsequent malicious actions taken in association with the script.
  - **Monitor Network Connections**: Examine network traffic logs for any unusual outbound connections initiated by the machine running the script, which may indicate data exfiltration or command and control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because the abuse of `RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.EXE` could lead to significant security issues, such as unauthorized access to virtual machine configurations or escalation of privileges within the environment. Prompt investigation is critical to mitigate any potential damage.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule primarily depends on the availability of PowerShell script block logging, which may not be enabled in all environments. Additionally, if attackers use alternate means to execute their payloads, such as employing encoded or obfuscated PowerShell commands, the detection may fail to activate. It assumes that all legitimate uses of similar script blocks are known and that no other processes or scripts are obscuring the malicious intent, which could lead to false negatives.

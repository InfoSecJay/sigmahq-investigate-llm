  ### Technical Context
  The "User Discovery And Export Via Get-ADUser Cmdlet 
  - PowerShell" detection rule identifies the use of the Get-ADUser cmdlet in PowerShell scripts that are employed to gather user information from Active Directory and subsequently redirect the output to a file. This technique is often utilized by adversaries to stealthily collect sensitive user data, which can be exploited for lateral movement or escalation in privileges. The rule specifically looks for script block text that includes the 'Get-ADUser' keyword in conjunction with output redirection commands such as `Out-File`, `Set-Content`, or `Add-Content`. The primary data sources leveraged for this detection include Windows PowerShell logs, specifically those from Script Block Logging, which must be enabled for effective monitoring. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Discovery (ID: T1033), where adversaries seek to uncover information about the users in a network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs**: Check the PowerShell script block logs for the specific occurrences of the command `Get-ADUser` to understand the context of the execution, including the user who initiated it and the exact parameters used.
  - **Assess User Activity**: Investigate the activity of the user associated with the detected command by querying EDR and investigating other logs (e.g., logon events) to determine whether the execution of the script appears anomalous.
  - **Analyze Output Locations**: If possible, inspect the locations where files were saved using the output redirection commands. Look for suspicious file paths or content within the files that may indicate unauthorized data collection.
  - **Check for Legitimate Use**: Validate whether this command execution was part of a legitimate administrative task by cross-referencing with known administrative workflows and user permissions to mitigate false positives.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for information disclosure and misuse by an adversary who may utilize this technique for reconnaissance and lateral movement within the network. Consequently, unanticipated or unauthorized use of this command should be treated with a degree of urgency.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where PowerShell Script Block Logging is not enabled, limiting visibility into PowerShell activities, or if the Get-ADUser cmdlet is used in benign scripts. Additionally, legitimate administrative accounts frequently executing similar commands can lead to false positives, indicating that exclusions or handcrafted whitelists may be necessary to refine alerting accuracy. It should also be noted that savvy adversaries may obfuscate their scripts or use non-standard cmdlets, further complicating detection.

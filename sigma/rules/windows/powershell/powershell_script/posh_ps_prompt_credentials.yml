  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect instances where PowerShell scripts invoke a credential prompt using the `PromptForCredential` method. Credential prompts are often leveraged by malicious actors to harvest user credentials via phishing techniques or exploitative scripts. The detection relies on Windows PowerShell script block logs, which capture and log the executed script text, including any calls to sensitive functions. For the detection to be effective, it is critical that script block logging is enabled on the target systems. When the rule identifies a script that contains the term `PromptForCredential`, it generates an alert for possible credential theft, enabling the SOC team to respond quickly to potential attacks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Query EDR logs to identify the specific PowerShell process that executed the script containing `PromptForCredential`. Look for unusual parent processes or execution contexts.
  - Examine the command-line parameters of the PowerShell execution to assess the context and intention behind the use of the credential prompt. 
  - Review user behaviors and logs from relevant systems to determine if there were any unauthorized or suspicious login attempts correlating with the alert.
  - Utilize AV and threat intelligence tools to check if the detected script is known for malicious activities or is associated with any ongoing threats.

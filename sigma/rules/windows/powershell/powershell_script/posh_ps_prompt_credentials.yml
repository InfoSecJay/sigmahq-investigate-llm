  ### Technical Context
  The "PowerShell Credential Prompt" detection rule monitors the use of PowerShell scripts that invoke the 'PromptForCredential' function. This function is commonly employed by malicious actors to solicit user credentials interactively, thereby facilitating credential theft. The rule operates on PowerShell Script Block Logging data, which captures detailed information about PowerShell execution, including the specific command being run. By analyzing the ScriptBlockText for mentions of 'PromptForCredential', this rule helps security teams identify potential unauthorized attempts to capture sensitive user information. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Credential Access (T1059.001) and Execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check PowerShell Logs:** Review the PowerShell Script Block Logs (Sysmon or Windows Event Logs) for occurrences of 'PromptForCredential' alongside the user context and source of the script execution to identify the origin and intent.
  - **Review User Activity:** Investigate other user activity logs (e.g., Windows Security Logs) related to the account that triggered the alert, looking for unusual actions or logins that may indicate compromised privileges.
  - **Analyze Network Connection:** Inspect any associated network connections using EDR or NDR tools to determine if the system communicated with any suspicious external entities at the time of the credential prompt.
  - **Cross-reference with Threat Intelligence:** Utilize threat intelligence platforms to see if there are known malicious scripts or indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the alert and assess the broader context of the incident.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as high severity due to the potential for credential theft, which poses significant risks to the organization, including unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data breaches.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that Script Block Logging is enabled in the PowerShell execution environment; without it, the rule will not trigger. Furthermore, attackers may use obfuscation techniques to hide their payloads, resulting in a failure to detect malicious activity if they do not explicitly invoke 'PromptForCredential'. Analysts should also be aware that legitimate applications or scripts may occasionally trigger this alert, leading to false positives that necessitate further investigation.

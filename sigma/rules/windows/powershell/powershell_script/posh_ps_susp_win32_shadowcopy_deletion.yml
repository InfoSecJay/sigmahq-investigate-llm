  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies in Windows systems using PowerShell scripts via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). It focuses on the execution of specific commands that leverage the `Get-WmiObject` or `Get-CimInstance` functions to query and subsequently delete shadow copies by utilizing methods like `.Delete()` or `Remove-WmiObject`. Volume Shadow Copies are crucial for system recovery, and their deletion is a common tactic employed by ransomware families such as Sodinokibi/REvil to hinder data recovery efforts during attacks. The rule leverages data from Windows PowerShell event logs to capture relevant script activity, which includes both the command parameters and the overall intent of the script being executed. This aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Impact" and technique T1490.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Execution Context:** Review the related PowerShell logs using the EDR tool to identify the user and environment context under which the script was executed. Check for any unusual account activity or permissions.
  - **Check for Previous Shadow Copies:** Utilize the Windows operating system or third-party backup solutions to confirm if any Volume Shadow Copies existed prior to the deletion event. This helps assess the impact of the deletion.
  - **Correlate with Other Indicators:** Investigate other security telemetry such as network connections, application logs, and system events around the same timestamp to identify related malicious activities or lateral movement.
  - **Review System Integrity and Backups:** After confirming the deletion, check whether the system or relevant data has alternate recovery options available, and audit overall backup configurations to ensure they are secure.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies significantly impacts data recovery capabilities and indicates a possible compromise or imminent ransomware attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not capture every instance of shadow copy deletion if the PowerShell logs are disabled, omitted, or if the commands are obfuscated. Additionally, the detection may fail in scenarios where an adversary employs alternate methods to delete shadow copies or utilizes other scripting languages that do not invoke the monitored commands. Analysts should also assume that legitimate administrative activities could occasionally trigger false positives; hence, context is essential in every incident.

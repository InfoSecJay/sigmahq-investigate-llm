  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the use of Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) through PowerShell scripts to enumerate unquoted service paths on Windows systems. Attackers may leverage unquoted service paths as a vector for privilege escalation, as these paths can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code with higher privileges if they contain spaces and are not properly quoted. The rule specifically looks for PowerShell script blocks that contain commands executed with `Get-WmiObject` (or its alias `gwmi`), along with references to the `Win32_Service` class and various attributes like `Name`, `DisplayName`, and `PathName`. The log source for detection requires that PowerShell script block logging is enabled, which captures the contents of scripts executed in PowerShell. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic ‘Execution’ and the technique ‘T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)’.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Alerts in EDR:** Check the EDR logs for alerts associated with PowerShell execution around the time of the alert to identify the user context and command history leading to this detection.
  - **Inspect PowerShell Logs:** Search PowerShell script block logging and module logging to understand the specific invocation context and parameters passed to `Get-WmiObject`, which helps ascertain the intent behind the command.
  - **Cross-Reference Process Creation Logs:** Look for related process creation events in Sysmon logs that may indicate suspicious activity preceding or following the detected WMIC invocation, ensuring to consider any child processes spawned.
  - **Query Registry Service Paths:** Use Registry logs to examine the service configuration, checking the `PathName` values for the services involved, which could verify the presence of unquoted service paths and potential misconfigurations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential misuse of WMIC for privilege escalation. While not an immediate threat, the behavior can be an early indicator of reconnaissance activity that could lead to further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection relies on the presence of PowerShell script block logging; if this configuration is not enabled, the rule will not fire. Additionally, attacks that do not utilize the specified PowerShell commands or that run in an environment where Powershell is restricted may bypass detection. It's assumed the attacker knows to employ different commands or tools, such as direct WMI calls without invoking PowerShell or using other scripting languages.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Windows Firewall Profile Disabled" detection rule focuses on identifying changes to the Windows Firewall settings through PowerShell commands. Specifically, it looks for the `Set-NetFirewallProfile` cmdlet being executed with the `-Enabled` parameter set to `False`, indicating that the firewall has been disabled for one or more profiles. This behavior is often associated with malicious actors attempting to evade detection and compromise systems by disabling key security features. The primary data source for this detection is PowerShell script block logging, which records the execution of scripts and commandlets, allowing analysis of actions that may indicate security breaches. This alert falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.004, which pertains to abuse of security features to evade defenses.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Examine the PowerShell script block logs for the specific command execution that disabled the firewall and check the user account executing the command.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Correlate the user IDs involved in the action with historical access logs from your EDR and authentication logs to identify any suspicious behavior leading up to the command execution.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Use network logs (e.g., EDR and firewall logs) to ascertain if any unusual outbound connections were made following the disabling of the firewall, which could indicate an active compromise.
  - **Validate Firewall Status:** Confirm the current state of the Windows Firewall profiles on the affected machine(s) by using `Get-NetFirewallProfile` via PowerShell, and assess whether the configuration aligns with organizational security policies.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risks associated with disabling the Windows Firewall, which can significantly reduce the systemâ€™s defense posture and increase vulnerability to attacks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule assumes that Script Block Logging is enabled, which may not be the case in all environments. This can lead to missed detections if the logs are not available. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may use techniques to obfuscate their command usage, such as invoking PowerShell in a way that bypasses normal logging, or may use an alternative method to disable the firewall settings. Furthermore, legitimate administrative activities, when performed without the proper context, may trigger false positives, misleading analysts during investigations.

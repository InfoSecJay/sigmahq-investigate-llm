title: Powershell LocalAccount Manipulation
id: 4fdc44df-bfe9-4fcc-b041-68f5a2d3031c
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems.
  Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups

  ### Technical Context
  The "Powershell LocalAccount Manipulation" detection rule focuses on identifying potential malicious activities associated with account manipulation through PowerShell commands. Adversaries may leverage specific PowerShell cmdlets to modify local accounts, which can involve disabling or enabling user accounts, modifying user properties, or creating and removing accounts altogether. This rule scans for specific commands such as `Disable-LocalUser`, `Enable-LocalUser`, `Get-LocalUser`, `Set-LocalUser`, `New-LocalUser`, `Rename-LocalUser`, and `Remove-LocalUser` within PowerShell script block logging data. The primary technical data source for this rule is Windows PowerShell script logging, which, to be effective, must have Script Block Logging enabled.
  This alert pertains to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1098 â€“ Account Manipulation under the Persistence tactic. By monitoring for these specific cmdlets invoked in unusual scenarios, the organization can detect and respond to potential account management activities that may indicate unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms used by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR logs:** Search for any recent PowerShell command executions related to local account manipulation on the affected host(s) within your EDR solution to identify the user or process that initiated the command.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Investigate the Windows Security Event Logs for account-related operations and cross-reference timestamps with the PowerShell execution to establish a timeline of events.
  - **Analyze user account changes:** Query the local user accounts on the impacted system to determine if any unauthorized changes were made, such as new user creation or permissions modification.
  - **Inspect logs from management or automation tools:** Check for any legitimate administrative scripts or automation tools that may have executed the PowerShell commands to rule out false positives.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert holds medium severity as the ability to manipulate local accounts can lead to significant security breaches and persistence strategies used by adversaries, indicating potential unauthorized access that requires immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule can be undermined if Script Block Logging is not enabled, as the requisite data would not be available for detection. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities may trigger false positives if system administrators are using PowerShell scripts to manage accounts appropriately. Furthermore, advanced adversaries might obfuscate their PowerShell commands, preventing detection by this rule.

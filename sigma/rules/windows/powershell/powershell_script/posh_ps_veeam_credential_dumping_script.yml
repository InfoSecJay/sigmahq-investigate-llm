  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts that utilize the Veeam Backup framework to extract stored credentials. Specifically, the rule looks for script blocks containing terms associated with Veeam's API, such as '[Credentials]', '[Veeam.Backup.Common.ProtectedStorage]::GetLocalString', 'Invoke-Sqlcmd', and 'Veeam Backup and Replication'. The primary technical data source involved in this detection is Windows PowerShell script execution logs, which capture the content of scripts executed within the environment. 
  In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this rule aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic (T1003), particularly focusing on the credential dumping technique (T1003.001). By identifying these specific PowerShell commands and script elements, the rule helps in early detection of potential credential theft, allowing the SOC to respond swiftly to security incidents.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Check your EDR for any related alerts that coincide with the time the PowerShell script was executed to determine if there are other suspicious activities on the endpoint.
  - **Analyze PowerShell Logs**: Isolate and examine PowerShell logs for the identified script execution, focusing on the commands run and their parameters for any atypical behavior.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Use log information from VPN, AD, or cloud logs to correlate with user activity around the time of the script execution to determine if it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or appears anomalous.
  - **Inspect Backup Configurations**: Review the Veeam Backup configurations for any recent changes or unauthorized access attempts to identify if legitimate administrators might be misusing their access privileges.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it signifies a critical risk to the integrity of stored credentials within backup servers. Immediate investigation is warranted because compromised credentials can escalate privileges and lead to further network breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One noted blind spot is the potential for legitimate backup scripts used by administrators to inadvertently trigger this detection rule, leading to false positives. Additionally, if an adversary uses different or obfuscated command strings to access Veeam APIs, the rule may fail to fire. Itâ€™s assumed that all PowerShell executions are monitored; however, if there are gaps in logging or if execution occurs in a non-standard environment, this could lead to missed detections. Responses should also consider the possibility of legitimate administrative actions that might require further validation.

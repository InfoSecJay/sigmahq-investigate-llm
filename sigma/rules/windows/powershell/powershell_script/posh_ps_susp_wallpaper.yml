  An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users.
  This may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects when PowerShell scripts are utilized to modify the desktop wallpaper on user systems, which can be an indicator of adversarial behavior aimed at intimidating or misleading employees within an organization. The rule focuses on detecting specific commands and registry interactions that are typically involved in the alteration of the desktop wallpaper. The detection relies on the Script Block Logging feature in PowerShell, which must be enabled for this rule to function. Specifically, the rule looks for PowerShell script blocks that contain commands to retrieve and set the wallpaper by accessing the Windows registry and using the `SystemParametersInfo` function. This behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1491.001, which pertains to "Defacement".
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine EDR Alerts:** Review alerts from your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool for any related PowerShell activity, particularly those that match the identified malicious ScriptBlockText. Look for users who might have their wallpaper changed unexpectedly.
  - **Check Windows Event Logs:** Investigate the Windows Security logs for logon events and the System logs for events around the time the wallpaper modification was detected. This can help determine if the user's session was compromised or if it was an authorized change.
  - **Analyze PowerShell Logs:** Review the PowerShell logs to find the specific command that was executed to change the wallpaper. Validate whether the command executed was legitimate or indicative of an attack.
  - **Review User Activity:** Correlate the detected activity with user logs to see if there are any additional indicators of compromised accounts or unauthorized access patterns that could suggest a broader attack.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential psychological impact of defacing a user's desktop wallpaper, this alert is classified as low severity; however, it shouldn't be overlooked, as it could be part of a larger campaign to manipulate or disrupt business operations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule assumes that Script Block Logging is enabled; if it is not, relevant activities may go undetected. Additionally, there may be legitimate scenarios where users change their wallpaper without malicious intent, leading to false positives. Attackers could also utilize obfuscation techniques to avoid detection, thus minimizing the effectiveness of this rule.

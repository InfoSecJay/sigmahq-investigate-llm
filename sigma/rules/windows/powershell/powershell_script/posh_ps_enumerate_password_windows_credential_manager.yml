title: Enumerate Credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell
id: 603c6630-5225-49c1-8047-26c964553e0e
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.
  Passwords are stored in several places on a system, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the use of PowerShell scripts that query and enumerate credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager using specific command-line arguments and keywords. Adversaries often target password storage locations like the Windows Credential Manager to acquire sensitive user credentials. The rule specifically looks for PowerShell script block log entries containing keywords such as "vaultcmd" and "/listcreds:," as well as related terms like "Windows Credentials" and "Web Credentials." To effectively capture this activity, ensuring that Script Block Logging is enabled is crucial, as it allows for the monitoring of PowerShell execution. This detection correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1555 under the "Credential Access" tactic, which highlights techniques for obtaining credentials from operating systems and applications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** Review the endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for PowerShell execution events around the time the alert was triggered. Focus on any unauthorized or unexpected processes that might be making calls to the Credential Manager.
  - **Analyze Script Block Logging Events:** Search Windows Security or Sysmon logs for Script Block Logging events that contain the specified keywords. This will help identify the specific command execution and its context.
  - **Review User Account Activity:** Verify the user account that executed the PowerShell command by correlated logins in your Active Directory logs or workstation logs. Assess if this account is typically authorized to perform such actions.
  - **Investigate Network Connections:** Use network logs to examine if the system attempted to connect to external resources after executing the command. This could indicate data exfiltration attempts using the retrieved credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked with a medium severity level because the enumeration of credentials can facilitate further malicious activities, such as lateral movement within the network. It is crucial to respond promptly as this may indicate a potential security breach or the exploitation of account privileges.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if Script Block Logging is not enabled on the system, which is a prerequisite for capturing PowerShell execution logs effectively. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries may obfuscate their commands or use tools that bypass common detection methods, making it vital for the SOC to continually refine detection parameters. Another consideration is that the activity may also occur through legitimate administrative tasks, leading to potential false positives that need careful validation.

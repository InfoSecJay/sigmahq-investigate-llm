  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the use of PowerShell commands that initiate a live memory dump on a Windows machine. Specifically, it looks for the execution of the `Get-StorageDiagnosticInfo` command with the `-IncludeLiveDump` parameter, which indicates that a memory dump is being requested. The primary data sources for this detection are Windows PowerShell logs, particularly focusing on script block logging. It is crucial for organizations to monitor such activities as they may indicate the presence of a malicious actor attempting to extract sensitive information from system memory. This alert aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1003 (Credential Dumping).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Script Block Logging**: Check if script block logging is enabled on the affected system to ensure relevant PowerShell activity is being recorded.
    
  - **Examine PowerShell Logs**: Use EDR tools to review PowerShell execution logs around the time of the alert to identify any unusual command execution or patterns.
  - **Analyze System Memory**: Utilize forensic tools to check for unauthorized memory dumps on the system, which can indicate potential data exfiltration.
  - **Investigate User Activity**: Review the user account activity associated with the execution, checking for any accounts that should not typically perform such actions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because the capability to dump live memory can be leveraged by an attacker to extract sensitive data, including credentials and other confidential information, posing a significant threat to the organization's security posture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the assumption that script block logging is enabled. If it is not, the detection may fail to trigger. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities or diagnostics may result in false positives, necessitating careful evaluation during investigation. Attackers may also use obfuscation techniques to mask their commands, leading to missed detections.

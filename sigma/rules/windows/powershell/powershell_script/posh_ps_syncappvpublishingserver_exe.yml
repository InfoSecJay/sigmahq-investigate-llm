  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of the `SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe` process, which adversaries often leverage to circumvent PowerShell execution policies. Typically, this executable is part of the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) client, but it can be misused to execute unauthorized scripts or commands silently in environments where PowerShell may be restricted. The rule monitors for specific script block logs in Sysmon that contain references to the `SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe`, adding a layer of visibility into potentially malicious activity consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1218 
  - "Signed Binary Proxy Execution." By enabling Script Block Logging in PowerShell environments, detection of this binary can help surface deceptive tactics that aim to evade security solutions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution**: Review the EDR logs for any instances of `SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe` execution, focusing on the parent process and associated command-line arguments to understand the context of its execution.
  - **Analyze PowerShell Logs**: Investigate PowerShell logs, particularly Script Block Logs, to identify any suspicious commands or scripts executed around the time of the detected event.
  - **Examine Network Connections**: Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to analyze outbound connections initiated by the process, checking for any unusual external communication patterns.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Look into User Access logs to correlate the timing of the `SyncAppvPublishingServer` execution with user's recent activities or known remote logins that could indicate possible credential theft or misuse.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of this alert, it is classified as medium severity, as it can indicate an active attempt to bypass security measures and conduct potentially malicious actions, warranting prompt investigation to assess real threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the availability of the Script Block Logging feature in PowerShell, which may not be enabled in all environments, thus leading to potential gaps in detection. Additionally, legitimate uses of `SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe` by Application Virtualization clients could generate false positives, highlighting the necessity for contextual analysis during investigations. Engineers should consider the possibility that attackers might employ alternative binaries or techniques to achieve similar evasion tactics, which will not trigger this specific rule.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects PowerShell scripts that attempt to import modules from suspicious directories commonly abused by adversaries, such as the Temp and AppData directories. By monitoring for the `Import-Module` command in conjunction with specific paths, such as `$Env:Temp\`, `$Env:Appdata\`, and `C:\Users\Public\`, the rule aims to uncover potentially malicious activities where attackers utilize these common repositories to house their scripts or tools. The script block logging must be enabled to capture these events, which are recorded as part of Windows Event Logs under the "ps_script" category. The identified MITRE ATT&CK technique is **T1059.001 
  - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows PowerShell**, which highlights the use of PowerShell for execution of potentially harmful commands.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine PowerShell Logs:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to review PowerShell script block logs where the detected commands were executed, paying attention to the time frame in which the alert was generated.
    
  - **Identify Unusual Source:** Investigate the source of the PowerShell execution, especially the parent processes, to determine whether the script was run in response to legitimate user activity or external threats.
  - **Analyze Environment Variables:** Review the environment variables relevant to the detected imports to ascertain whether the paths lead to known malicious content or if they belong to legitimate applications.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Use your EDR tools to check for any suspicious behavior associated with the identified processes, including additional commands executed or files created in the detected directories.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of medium is assigned to this alert because while the detection of PowerShell importing modules from suspicious directories could indicate malicious intent, it may also arise from benign scripts. Therefore, context and further investigation are crucial to ascertain the legitimacy of the behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where script block logging for PowerShell is not enabled, which can result in a lack of visibility into potentially malicious activities. Additionally, skilled attackers may obfuscate their commands or use less common module paths to avoid detection. It is assumed that PowerShell is being used in a manner that generates the necessary logs; if PowerShell is executed in constrained language mode or through alternate means that do not trigger event logging, the rule may also fail to fire.

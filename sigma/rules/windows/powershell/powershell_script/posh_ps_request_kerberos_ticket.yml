title: Request A Single Ticket via PowerShell
id: a861d835-af37-4930-bcd6-5b178bfb54df
status: test
description: |
  utilize native PowerShell Identity modules to query the domain to extract the Service Principal Names for a single computer.
  This behavior is typically used during a kerberos or silver ticket attack.
  A successful execution will output the SPNs for the endpoint in question.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is focused on detecting the use of PowerShell to perform actions that pertain to requesting a single Kerberos ticket, which is often used in malicious activities such as Kerberos or silver ticket attacks. It specifically looks for the invocation of native PowerShell Identity modules to extract the Service Principal Names (SPNs) associated with a computer in a domain. The detection works by monitoring PowerShell script block logs for specific script block content that indicates this behavior, namely the presence of `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken`. When triggered, this rule signals potentially malicious activities aimed at manipulating Kerberos authentication for unauthorized access. This behavior is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK techniques "Credential Access" (T1558.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs for PowerShell script block logs that contain the `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken` keyword. Focus on the log entries correlating with the time of the alert.
  - **Inspect Related Processes:** Leverage EDR tools to review the processes running at the time of the suspicious PowerShell command execution. Look for unusual parent-child relationships or any processes that are not typically associated with user activity.
  - **Validate Service Principal Names:** Use Active Directory tools to verify the SPNs requested during the incident. Ensure these SPNs are legitimate and correspond directly to the service accounts and machines that are expected within your domain architecture.
  - **Threat Hunting:** Conduct a broader search on the network for any additional instances or behaviors resembling Kerberos ticket requests using similar PowerShell commands. This may uncover patterns indicating a larger compromise or ongoing attack.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the potential implications of a Kerberos exploitation attempt, which could lead to unauthorized access to critical systems and data if not promptly mitigated. Rapid investigation and remediation are critical to safeguarding the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are a few recognized limitations with this detection rule. First, it relies on PowerShell script block logging being enabled, which may not always be configured in all environments. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks executed via PowerShell could potentially trigger this alert, leading to false positives. Adversaries could also employ obfuscation or alternative scripting methods to bypass detection. As such, contextual awareness of the environment and ongoing activities is crucial for accurately interpreting the alerts.

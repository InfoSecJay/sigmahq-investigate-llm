  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for "Powershell WMI Persistence" is designed to detect attempts by adversaries to establish persistence on Windows systems through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscriptions. Specifically, it looks for the creation of new instances of `__EventFilter` and `CommandLineEventConsumer` classes in the `root/subscription` namespace using PowerShell. These actions are indicative of an attacker using WMI to run a malicious payload whenever a specific system event occurs, which allows for automatic execution of the malware. The detection relies on script block logging, which must be enabled within the Windows environment to capture relevant PowerShell command data being executed. This technique aligns with MITRE ATT&CK's privilege escalation tactics (T1546.003 
  - WMI Event Subscription).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs**: Search through the PowerShell script logs in your SIEM or EDR tool to find records of the `New-CimInstance` command and examine the associated `ScriptBlockText` for suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Event Subscriptions**: Use WMI tools like PowerShell (e.g., `Get-WmiObject -Namespace root/subscription -Query "SELECT * FROM __EventFilter"`) to enumerate existing event subscriptions and check for any unauthorized or unexpected entries.
  - **Inspect Processes**: Look through the current running processes in the EDR for any instances of PowerShell or processes triggered by WMI events that could reflect misuse or exploitation of legitimate PowerShell commands.
  - **Correlate Network Activity**: Utilize network detection tools to correlate any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration patterns that coincide with the time frame of the WMI event subscription creation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert's medium severity suggests that while the activity isn't immediately catastrophic, it indicates potential unauthorized attempts to establish persistence, warranting investigation to prevent prolonged compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes the environment has enabled script block logging, which is necessary for detection. If this logging is not enabled, the rule will not trigger even if malicious activity occurs. Additionally, false negatives may arise if attackers use alternative methods to create persistence or obfuscate their commands to evade detection. Engineers should also consider how malicious actors might deploy countermeasures such as disabling logging or altering WMI event filters to avoid detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the PowerShell cmdlet `New-MailboxExportRequest`, which allows an attacker to export mailbox data from Microsoft Exchange to a file on a remote or local share. This action is particularly concerning when it is executed in the context of known vulnerabilities, such as the ProxyShell exploit, where an unauthorized user can manipulate mailbox data. The rule leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging to capture and analyze the command lines that include key parameters: the mailbox identifier and the file path specified as a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path, indicating the use of network shares. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Exfiltration" under technique T1041.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check EDR for any active alerts related to PowerShell script execution, specifically looking for alerts that mention suspicious commands or activities around `New-MailboxExportRequest`.
  - **Analyze PowerShell Logs:** Access the Windows PowerShell logs to identify the complete scripting context, noting the parent command line and other executed commands around the time of the event.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Examine any outbound connections initiated during the time of the alert to verify potential data exfiltration destinations and confirm if they align with known malicious IPs or unexpected external destinations.
  - **Audit Mailbox Access Logs:** Analyze logs from Microsoft Exchange to ascertain if the mailbox export request aligns with user activity and whether the account making the request is authorized for such actions.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as critical due to the potential for sensitive data exfiltration from mailboxes, which can lead to significant security breaches and operational impacts if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes Script Block Logging is enabled; thus, it may not fire in environments where this logging is disabled. Additionally, if an adversary uses obfuscation techniques or modifies the PowerShell command to evade detection, the rule may fail to capture the malicious activity. Users should also be aware that legitimate administrative tasks may trigger false positives if not carefully contextualized.

title: Extracting Information with PowerShell

  Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing insecurely stored credentials.
  These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals,
  configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the use of PowerShell scripts that are employed by adversaries to extract sensitive information from file systems. Specifically, it focuses on identifying script block logging events where the ScriptBlockText contains command phrases commonly associated with searching for files and strings, such as `ls`, `-R`, `select-string`, and `-Pattern`. These PowerShell commands indicate attempts to traverse directories and extract configuration files that may contain insecurely stored credentials, which could allow attackers unauthorized access to systems and services. This detection is tied to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Credential Access** and its respective technique **T1552.001**.
  The rule's reliance on Script Block Logging means that organizations need to ensure this logging feature is enabled on their Windows systems to effectively capture the necessary events for analysis. When this rule triggers an alert, it signals that an investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy of the PowerShell activities being performed and whether they pose a threat to the organization's credential security.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Investigate the PowerShell execution logs in your EDR solution to correlate the triggered alert with user activity and the context of the command execution.
  - **Analyze Recent Credentials Access:** Use Windows Security Event Logs to check for any recent events relating to credential access or unauthorized access attempts following the alert.
  - **Evaluate File System Changes:** Identify any recent modifications or access to files that may potentially store credentials, particularly those flagged by the PowerShell commands detected.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Cross-reference the user account associated with the alert with any known malicious activity to determine if this behavior is typical for the user or indicative of a compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as medium due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized access to stored credentials, which can lead to further exploitation within the environment if not promptly addressed.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several blind spots and assumptions related to this rule. First, the detection relies on the assumption that Script Block Logging is enabled across all relevant systems; if not, this rule will not trigger. Additionally, the rule may not account for legitimate administrative use of PowerShell scripts that match the command patterns or strings, leading to false positives. Furthermore, adversaries may obfuscate their PowerShell commands or utilize alternative scripting languages to bypass this detection.

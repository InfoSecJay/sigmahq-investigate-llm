  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the usage of specific PowerShell cmdlets associated with Hyper-V, notably `New-VM`, `Set-VMFirmware`, and `Start-VM`. These cmdlets allow users to create and manage virtual machines within a Windows environment, which adversaries may leverage for evading detection during malicious operations. The detection mechanism relies on monitoring Windows PowerShell script block logs with script block logging enabled. By observing these cmdlets in script execution, the rule identifies potential misuse in line with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the specific technique (T1564.006) that relates to the use of virtual environments for executing tasks covertly.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query PowerShell Execution Logs**: Use the EDR solution to search PowerShell execution history to identify instances where the flagged cmdlets were used. Look for any abnormal contextual usage or unauthorized access attempts.
    
  - **Analyze Process Creation Events**: Investigate the process creation logs associated with these cmdlets to find the parent processes, ensuring they align with known admin activity or legitimate automation scripts.
  - **Inspect User Activity**: Check the user accounts that executed these cmdlets in the context of the incident. Assess whether these accounts have a typical usage pattern or if there are signs of compromise.
  - **Review Network Connections**: Evaluate any network connections made during the execution of these cmdlets to correlate with known infrastructure or data exfiltration activities relating to virtual environments.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level assigned to this alert indicates that, while leveraging Hyper-V can be a legitimate administrative action, its use in a suspicious context, particularly with detection evasion objectives, raises substantial security concerns warranting prompt investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PowerShell script block logging is enabled, which may not be configured in all environments, and thus could lead to missed detections. Moreover, the rule might not fire in cases where legitimate automation scripts utilize the identified cmdlets, or adversaries employ alternative methods to manipulate virtual environments without using the targeted cmdlets. Understanding these limitations is crucial for incident responders.

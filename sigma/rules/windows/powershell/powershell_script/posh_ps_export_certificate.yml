  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Certificate Exported Via PowerShell 
  - ScriptBlock" is crafted to detect the use of PowerShell cmdlets that are specifically associated with exporting certificates from the local certificate store. Adversaries may exploit these cmdlets, particularly `Export-PfxCertificate` and `Export-Certificate`, to extract sensitive private keys from a system, thereby compromising the security of the environment. The rule operates by analyzing PowerShell script block logging, which must be enabled to capture the execution of PowerShell commands. When PowerShell scripts containing these specific cmdlets are executed, they trigger alerts based on the defined conditions in the Sigma rule. The related MITRE ATT&CK tactic is credential access, specifically the technique T1552.004, which deals with the extraction of credentials from certificates and other secure storage. The use of this rule enhances the organization's ability to detect unauthorized attempts to access and exfiltrate sensitive information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check the PowerShell script block logs in Windows Event Logs for any recent executions of the `Export-PfxCertificate` or `Export-Certificate` cmdlets. Look for unusual patterns or suspicious executions by non-administrative users.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Use EDR tools to examine the process tree associated with PowerShell execution. Confirm that the parent process is legitimate and trace back to the originating user for further insights.
  - **Inspect User Activity:** Investigate the user account implicated in the alert to determine if it has a history of legitimate administrative behavior. Also, assess any recent changes to the certificate store or installed applications.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Evaluate the outbound connections made by the machine where the potentially malicious command was executed. Look for connections to external IPs that may indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity as it indicates a potentially risky action taken within the environment, with possible implications for credential theft. Immediate investigation is warranted as it could indicate the presence of a compromised account or insider threat.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if PowerShell script block logging is disabled, which is a common configuration oversight. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions may cause false positives, as administrators may perform authorized exports. Attackers could also circumvent detection by using obfuscation techniques or executing commands in a manner that does not reveal the cmdlets being used. It's important for detection engineers to continuously refine the rule and take context into account to minimize blind spots.

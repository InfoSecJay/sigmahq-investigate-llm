title: Manipulation of User Computer or Group Security Principals Across AD

status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may create a domain account to maintain access to victim systems.
  Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain..

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule monitors for potential abuse of Active Directory through the manipulation of security principals, specifically through the creation of domain accounts using PowerShell scripts. Adversaries may exploit administrative permissions to create unauthorized domain accounts as a means of maintaining persistent access to compromised systems within an organization's Active Directory environment. The detection logic leverages Windows PowerShell script block logging to identify instances where the script block contains the `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement` class, which is commonly used to manage user accounts in Active Directory.
  Monitoring for this behavior is critical because unauthorized domain account creation is a tactic used in lateral movement and persistence, categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework as "Persistence" (T1136.002). Identifying these actions early can help mitigate further unauthorized access or lateral movements within the organization's infrastructure.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Related Activity:** Investigate recent events related to the alert within the EDR console by correlating process creation logs to identify any unauthorized PowerShell scripts run around the time of the alert.
  - **Review PowerShell Transcription Logs:** Examine PowerShell logs for any other commands executed in conjunction with the account creation to gather context on the actions taken by the potential attacker.
  - **Analyze Active Directory Changes:** Use Active Directory monitoring tools to review recent modifications to security principals and verify if suspicious user accounts were created or existing accounts were modified.
  - **Cross-Reference with User Access Logs:** Look through VPN, proxy, or remote access logs to see if abnormal logins or anomalies correspond with the times the suspicious script was executed, providing clues about potential malicious behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is set to medium due to the serious implications of unauthorized account creation in Active Directory, which could enable threat actors to gain persistent access to sensitive systems and data. Any alerts of this nature should be treated with urgency to prevent further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PowerShell script block logging is enabled, which may not be the case in all environments, leading to potential missing detections. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities could trigger false positives if administrative users are employing PowerShell for valid account creation tasks. Adversaries may also utilize other means of account management that bypass normal logging mechanisms, which may not be captured by this rule.

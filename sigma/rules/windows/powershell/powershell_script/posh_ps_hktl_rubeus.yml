  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of the Rubeus hack tool through specific command line arguments within PowerShell Script Blocks. Rubeus is an advanced tool used for manipulating Kerberos tickets and obtaining credentials, making it a significant concern for credential theft and lateral movement within a network. The rule captures specific phrases indicative of Rubeus functionality, such as "asreproast" and "kerberoast," which are associated with Kerberos exploitation. It relies on the telemetry provided by Windows PowerShell Script Block Logging, which must be enabled to capture relevant execution details, including command parameters and script syntax. The associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques are T1003 (Credential Dumping) and T1558.003 (Use Alternate Authentication Material), highlighting the role of Rubeus in credential access and lateral movement tactics.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Check Windows PowerShell Script Block logs for the detected strings related to Rubeus execution. Ensure that logging is enabled to capture these events.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize the EDR solution to check for any abnormal process behavior or executions around the time of the Rubeus alerts. Look for associated process trees that may indicate lateral movement.
  - **Analyze User Behavior:** Investigate the user account associated with the alert to assess whether the execution of Rubeus is consistent with normal operational behavior. Identify any unusual login patterns or access to sensitive resources.
  - **Search for Network Indicators:** Use network logs to search for any outgoing connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains related to Rubeus. Look especially for authentication requests or other abnormal traffic patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of credential theft tools like Rubeus. Its execution can lead to significant security breaches, including unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if PowerShell Script Block Logging is not enabled or adequately configured within your environment. It also assumes that the attacker may attempt to obfuscate commands or use alternate methods to call Rubeus, which may evade detection. Additionally, environments with minimal PowerShell usage or restrictive execution policies may see reduced effectiveness of this rule.

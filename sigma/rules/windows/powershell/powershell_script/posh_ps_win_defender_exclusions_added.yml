  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies modifications made to Windows Defender configurations through PowerShell scripts, specifically when exclusions are added to the antivirus's monitoring capabilities. The detection focuses on the invocation of `Add-MpPreference` and `Set-MpPreference` commands alongside particular arguments that specify exclusion paths, extensions, processes, or IP addresses. The underlying data sources for this rule include PowerShell script block logs, which capture the details of executed PowerShell functions, such as the command arguments and script block contents. By monitoring these entries, the rule aims to detect potential defense evasion tactics utilized by attackers to exempt malicious files or processes from antivirus scanning. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for defense evasion (T1562) and execution (T1059), indicating attempts to circumvent security measures through scripting.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Logs**: Query PowerShell logs via the SIEM to examine the context surrounding the execution of `Add-MpPreference` or `Set-MpPreference`, focusing on the specific arguments used in the script.
  - **Inspect Process Activity**: Utilize EDR tools to investigate any processes that were active around the time the exclusion was added, looking for unusual or suspicious behavior.
  - **Analyze Exclusions**: Cross-reference the exclusions added against known good applications and processes. Validate whether these exclusions appear legitimate or if they might be associated with malicious activity.
  - **Check for Related Activity**: Investigate other logs, such as network connections or file access events, that might correlate with the time frame when the exclusions were made to identify further indicators of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because unauthorized modifications to Windows Defender can indicate ongoing or planned malicious activity, potentially allowing further exploitation if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PowerShell script block logging is properly configured and enabled in the environment; if this logging is disabled or not properly archived, the detection will fail. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may employ methods such as obfuscation or using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, which could evade detection by this rule. Finally, the rule may not trigger if exclusions are added through the Windows GUI or other mechanisms outside of PowerShell.

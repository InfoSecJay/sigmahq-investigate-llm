title: Suspicious Connection to Remote Account
id: 1883444f-084b-419b-ac62-e0d0c5b3693f
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts.
  Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential brute-force attacks against Active Directory accounts using PowerShell scripts. Specifically, it looks for the presence of certain PowerShell commands and classes indicative of LDAP connections, notably `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapDirectoryIdentifier`, `System.Net.NetworkCredential`, and `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapConnection`. The rule leverages Windows PowerShell script block logging as its primary data source, detecting script block text to identify the execution of potentially malicious code aimed at guessing passwords or gaining unauthorized access to accounts without prior knowledge of legitimate credentials. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the Credential Access tactic (T1110.001), which focuses on brute-forcing authentication credentials.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Detected Scripts:** Examine the PowerShell script block logs for instances of the detected strings to understand the context in which they were used and identify any variables or parameters that may indicate further malicious intent.
  - **Check Network Communications:** Utilize EDR tools to track outbound connections from the host initiating the LDAP queries, looking for unusual destination IPs or anomalies in communication patterns.
  - **Evaluate User Behavior:** Investigate the user account involved in the connection attempts for any signs of compromise or suspicious activity, including looking at recent logons and access patterns in Active Directory.
  - **Audit Security Events:** Cross-reference the Grafana logs or Windows Security event logs for failed authentication attempts related to the same account to gather additional evidence that may point to a brute-force attack.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert pertains to unauthorized attempts to access Active Directory credentials, it is categorized with low severity; however, it warrants investigation due to the potential for compromise if left unchecked, especially in environments with sensitive data or critical infrastructure.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if PowerShell script block logging is not enabled or if the adversary employs obfuscation techniques to disguise their command usage. Moreover, legitimate administrative use of similar PowerShell commands could lead to false positives, requiring careful analysis of the context in which the commands were executed. Additionally, if an attacker directly manipulates authentication protocols outside of PowerShell, this rule might miss those malicious activities.

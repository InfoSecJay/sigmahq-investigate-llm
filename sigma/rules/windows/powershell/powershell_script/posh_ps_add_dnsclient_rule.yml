title: Powershell Add Name Resolution Policy Table Rule
id: 4368354e-1797-463c-bc39-a309effbe8d7
status: test
description: |
  Detects powershell scripts that adds a Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT) rule for the specified namespace.
  This will bypass the default DNS server and uses a specified server for answering the query.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule leverages PowerShell script block logging to identify the use of the `Add-DnsClientNrptRule` cmdlet, which adds a Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT) rule that allows the modification of DNS query handling for specified namespaces. The rule specifically looks for script block executions that contain key parameters indicating an NRPT rule is being added, such as `-Namesp` and `-NameSe`. The presence of these parameters suggests malicious intent, as attackers can use NRPT rules to bypass the default DNS server, redirecting queries to possibly controlled or malicious servers. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic “Impact” and technique T1565, which deals with the manipulation of the network configurations to affect systems' behavior.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Inspect EDR Alerts:** Check for any recent alerts related to PowerShell execution, focusing on the specific time frame in which the NRPT rule was added. This will help establish the context of the activity.
  - **Review Script Block Logs:** Utilize Windows Security logs to examine detailed PowerShell script block logs that triggered this alert. Look for the complete command executed and any additional parameters used.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Analyze DNS query logs from the NGFW or DNS logs to determine if queries are being directed to unexpected DNS servers, suggesting that the changes have taken effect.
  - **Assess Endpoint Behavior:** Investigate the host where the alert was triggered to see if there are any ongoing suspicious processes or network connections initiated around the same time.
  ### Prioritization
  The high-severity level of this alert indicates an immediate need for investigation, as adding NRPT rules can signify a significant threat to network integrity. Quick action is crucial as this could lead to data exfiltration or the circumvention of security measures.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PowerShell script block logging is enabled and functioning properly; without this logging, relevant data will not be captured, causing the rule to fail to fire. Additionally, the rule may not detect obfuscated or circumvented PowerShell commands that do not contain the specified parameters or vary slightly in phrasing. Adversaries may also implement measures such as using alternate scripting languages or command line tools to bypass detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious activity involving the use of the PowerShell cmdlet `Import-Module`, specifically targeting the `Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll`. This library is frequently utilized by administrators for legitimate Active Directory (AD) management tasks; however, adversaries may exploit it to enumerate AD objects without proper permissions. The rule looks for specific patterns in the script block logs, monitoring the execution of PowerShell scripts that import this module. The primary data sources leveraged for this detection are PowerShell script block logs, requiring that script block logging is enabled on the monitored endpoints. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics include **Reconnaissance** (T1071) and **Discovery** (T1087).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Script Block Logs**: Use EDR tools to access the script block logs and verify the context in which the `Import-Module` command was executed. Look for unusual process parental relationships or execution times.
    
  - **Analyze User Activity**: Cross-reference the user account associated with the PowerShell execution against your identity management logs. Check for signs of privilege escalation or unusual behavior that accompanies the AD enumeration.
  - **Check Process Execution Path**: Investigate the origin of the PowerShell process execution, including any scripts or commands that were run prior to the detected activity. This can help determine if the execution was part of a benign administrative task or a potentially malicious action.
  - **Monitor Network Connections**: Inspect outbound network traffic related to the detected activity. If AD enumeration was used as part of a broader attack pattern, there may be additional suspicious network activities that correlate with the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level is assigned to this alert as it indicates potential reconnaissance activity that could precede a targeted attack on Active Directory. Prompt investigation is critical to prevent any possible escalation or exploitation of sensitive organizational data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Assumptions include the requirement for script block logging to be enabled for this rule to function correctly. Additionally, the rule may generate false positives during legitimate administrative activities where the `Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll` is utilized for valid purposes. Blind spots include scenarios where attackers may use other methods to enumerate Active Directory, such as through alternative PowerShell modules or by using non-PowerShell tools, which this rule would not capture.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Keylogger Activity" is designed to detect PowerShell scripts that invoke keystroke-capturing functionality, specifically by checking for references to the `IsKeyDown` method from the `[Windows.Input.Keyboard]` class in the script block text. This particular detection leverages PowerShell's script block logging feature, which records the content of executed scripts and commandlets. The rule triggers an alert when a script contains strings that indicate attempts to capture keystrokes, thereby signaling potential credential theft or other malicious intent. The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic is **Collection**, with a specific focus on **Credential Access** using technique [T1056.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001), which highlights the risk of keylogging.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Collect Script Block Logs:** Review PowerShell script block logs from your SIEM or EDR to identify the specific event and associated user context when the alert was triggered. Focus on recent execution timestamps and user activity logs.
  - **Examine Process Creation Events:** Check for process creation events related to the execution of the PowerShell scripts that triggered the alert. Look for unusual parent-child relationships or known malicious commands.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize network detection and response tools to monitor outbound traffic from the affected system. Investigate any suspicious connections that may correlate with the execution of the detected scripts.
  - **Review User Activity:** Inspect logs from Windows Event Viewer and EDR solutions for user actions around the time of the alert. Assess for any additional signs of compromise or suspicious behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential severity of keylogger behavior, which can lead to credential theft or unauthorized data access. The presence of such scripts warrants immediate attention, as they may indicate an attacker actively attempting to compromise sensitive information.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several factors that may limit the effectiveness of this detection rule. For instance, if PowerShell script block logging is not enabled in the environment, the rule will not fire, thereby creating a blind spot for potential keystroke capturing activities. Additionally, savvy adversaries might obfuscate their scripts or use other scripting methods that do not trigger this detection, such as bypassing PowerShell logging or employing different programming languages. Analysts should consider these limitations when evaluating alerts and conducting investigations.

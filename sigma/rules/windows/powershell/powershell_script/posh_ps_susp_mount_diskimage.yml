  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Mount-DiskImage" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activities involving the mounting of disk image files, such as ISO or VHD files, via PowerShell commands. Adversaries may leverage these file formats to deliver and execute payloads that do not carry a Mark of the Web (MOTW), allowing them to evade basic security checks. This rule primarily focuses on identifying PowerShell script blocks that contain specific commands indicative of an attempt to mount disk images, specifically looking for the presence of 'Mount-DiskImage' and '-ImagePath' parameters in script executions. By analyzing PowerShell script block logging, security operations teams can detect unusual disk image mounting behavior that could signify a breach or compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Query EDR logs for any recent PowerShell executions that contain a 'Mount-DiskImage' command to gather context about the process and user that executed it.
  - Review the command-line parameters associated with the PowerShell process to determine the specific disk image files being mounted and their locations on disk.
  - Cross-reference the mounted disk image with threat intelligence sources to identify if the file is from a known malicious source or if it has characteristics of a suspicious file.
  - Check proxy logs for any outbound connections made after the disk image was mounted, which may indicate potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.

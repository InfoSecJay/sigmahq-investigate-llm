  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify attempts to access the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process from specific, potentially whitelisted processes. The LSASS process is critical in managing security policies and handling authentication, which makes it a target for attackers seeking to extract credentials from memory. The rule specifically looks for actions where permitted applications, such as `TrolleyExpress.exe`, `ProcessDump.exe`, or `dump64.exe`, are trying to read memory from the `lsass.exe` process using access rights indicative of memory dumping activities. The detection is informed by various process access rights that signify potential credential dumping activities and is classified under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Credential Access** (specifically the technique **T1003.001**: Credential Dumping through LSASS). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts**: Query the EDR for alerts around the time of the detection to review the behavior of the whitelisted processes and check for additional processes attempting similar memory access.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Collect logs from process creation events to confirm that the specified whitelisted processes were indeed executed and to gather insights on their command-line arguments.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Inspect network activity associated with the detected processes to determine if there were any suspicious outbound connections that could suggest exfiltration of credentials.
  - **Cross-reference with User Activity**: Investigate the legitimacy of the user account tied to the alert in the context of their activities to ascertain if this approach aligns with expected behavior for the given timeframe.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it is crucial in an enterprise environment because successful credential dumping can lead to unauthorized access, lateral movement, and significant data breaches. Quick response is necessary to mitigate these risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule operates under the assumption that attackers will attempt to use commonly whitelisted processes to evade detection effectively. However, it may not fire if an attacker either modifies the listed executable names or utilizes entirely new, unforeseen processes for credential dumping. Additionally, if the telemetry sources are incomplete or improperly configured, meaningful alerts might be missed. Analysts should also consider the potential for false positives due to legitimate use cases of the whitelisted applications.

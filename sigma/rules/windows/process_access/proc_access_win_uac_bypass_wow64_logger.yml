  ### Technical Context
  The UAC Bypass Using WOW64 Logger DLL Hijack detection rule identifies attempts by adversaries to bypass User Account Control (UAC) through a specific technique involving the hijacking of a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) within the Windows SysWOW64 directory. This behavior typically manifests when malicious processes attempt to access system resources with elevated privileges without user consent. The rule watches for processes that originate from the SysWOW64 directory, have specific granted access flags indicating high-level permissions (0x1fffff), and exhibit unusual call trace patterns starting with 'UNKNOWN'. These metrics signify a potential exploit aimed at privilege escalation in the environment. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically technique T1548.002.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Suspicious Processes:** Use EDR tools to analyze the processes accessing the SysWOW64 directory, particularly focusing on the source image and associated parent-child relationships to confirm if unauthorized modifications are present.  
  - **Examine Call Traces:** Investigate the call traces related to the flagged processes using Sysmon logs to identify any anomalies or patterns that may indicate DLL hijacking or other, unauthorized behavior.
  - **Correlate Security Events:** Analyze Windows Security logs to correlate any event IDs related to the suspicious processes with user logins or other system changes that may indicate an exploitation attempt.
  - **Conduct Network Analysis:** Review blocked and allowed network traffic to identify any outgoing or incoming connections from the suspected processes, looking for patterns that align with known Command and Control (C2) behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a high severity due to the nature of its detection; successful UAC bypass attempts can lead to significant compromise of user and system access within the network environment, potentially resulting in ransomware deployments, data exfiltration, or persistent threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One primary assumption of this rule is that all process access logs, particularly those related to SysWOW64, are available and collected accurately. A potential blind spot exists if an adversary utilizes legitimate processes or tools in non-standard ways, thereby obfuscating their activity. Additionally, if the identified access privileges are legitimate (e.g., from an admin process), the rule may not fire, leading to missed detections of otherwise malicious behavior.

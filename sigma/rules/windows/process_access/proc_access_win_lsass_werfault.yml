title: Credential Dumping Attempt Via WerFault
id: e5b33f7d-eb93-48b6-9851-09e1e610b6d7
status: test
description: Detects process LSASS memory dump using Mimikatz, NanoDump, Invoke-Mimikatz,
  Procdump or Taskmgr based on the CallTrace pointing to ntdll.dll, dbghelp.dll or
  dbgcore.dll for win10, server2016 and up.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential credential dumping attempts by monitoring access to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process via the `WerFault.exe` service. Specifically, it looks for instances where `WerFault.exe`, a Windows error reporting tool, processes memory dumps of `lsass.exe`, which could indicate the use of tools like Mimikatz, NanoDump, or Procdump to extract clear-text credentials from memory. The detection leverages process access logs to look for events where `WerFault.exe` attempts to access `lsass.exe` with maximum privileges (as indicated by the `GrantedAccess` parameter set to `0x1FFFFF`). This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Credential Access tactic (T1003.001 
  - OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Access Logs**: Utilize EDR tools to examine the process access logs around the time of the alert, focusing on `WerFault.exe` accessing `lsass.exe` to understand the context of the activity.
  - **Correlate with Event Logs**: Check Windows Security and Sysmon logs for any abnormal behavior or associated processes that may indicate an ongoing credential dumping attempt.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Use NDR tools to investigate any unusual outbound network connections from the host involved, which might suggest exfiltration of credentials or interaction with known malicious infrastructure.
  - **Verify System Integrity**: Utilize antivirus or EDR solutions to run scans on the affected systems for known tools (like Mimikatz) and ensure that system integrity is intact, looking for any signs of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has a high severity level due to the critical nature of the LSASS process in maintaining security on Windows systems. Successful credential dumping can lead to unauthorized access and potential lateral movement in the network, making timely investigation crucial.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where legitimate error reporting occurs, causing a valid `WerFault.exe` interaction with `lsass.exe`. Additionally, it assumes that `WerFault.exe` has not been modified or abused by an adversary to mask their activities. False negatives may occur if an attacker uses alternative methods or processes not captured by this rule to access LSASS memory.

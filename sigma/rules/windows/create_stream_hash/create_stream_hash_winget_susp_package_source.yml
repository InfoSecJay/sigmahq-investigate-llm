  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule 'Potential Suspicious Winget Package Installation' identifies potential malicious activities relating to the installation of packages via the Windows Package Manager (winget). It achieves this by monitoring certain entries in the Windows event logs, specifically focusing on the creation of zone identifier files (`:Zone.Identifier`). These files are added to indicate the security zone of downloaded files and can reveal if the source of the files is untrusted (i.e., ZoneId=3). The rule checks for file contents that may originate from specified untrusted sources, which are customizable depending on the enterprise's operational environment. Such indicators could point towards malicious downloads or installations intended to bypass traditional security measures (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.006 / Persistence, Technique: T1053).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Use Windows Security or Sysmon logs to identify the events corresponding to the detected suspicious winget installations, focusing on the creation of the `:Zone.Identifier` files.
  - **Analyze Source URLs:** Investigate the specific URLs referenced in the logs for any known malicious indicators or reputation using threat intelligence platforms or EDR tools.
  - **Check Package Origins:** Verify if the packages installed via winget come from legitimate repositories and cross-reference against allowed packages in your environment.
  - **Monitor System Behavior:** Utilize EDR tools to monitor any additional suspicious activities or changes in the system that may correlate with the installation of potentially malicious packages.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for attackers to exploit package managers like winget to install malicious software, thus compromising system integrity and organizational security.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several blind spots and assumptions associated with this rule. If the source of the packages is not properly flagged as untrusted or if custom substantial additions are not made to the list of known untrusted domains, the rule may not trigger. Additionally, legitimate software that may use untrusted URLs could falsely trigger the alert. Adversaries could also use techniques to obfuscate their download sources or alter `Zone.Identifier` files, making detection more challenging.

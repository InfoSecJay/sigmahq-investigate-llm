  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) that contains an executable file by examining the non-empty Imphash. An ADS is a feature within the NTFS file system that allows users to attach additional metadata to files without affecting the primary file itself. By leveraging logs from Windows Sysmon (or an equivalent system set up to log Imphash), the rule identifies when a new ADS is created that includes a non-zero Imphash value, indicating that it may contain executable content. The detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1564.004 (Alternate Data Streams), which is part of the defense evasion tactic. Once an analyst recognizes an alert from this rule, they can initiate follow-up investigations on the corresponding process to ascertain if it may signify malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze the Process Creation Logs:** Review process creation logs in Sysmon to track the executable that created the ADS. Look for any indications of suspicious behavior such as unusual parent-child relationships or command-line arguments.
    
  - **Check the ADS Content:** Use tools capable of reading and analyzing ADS to extract the contents of the identified ADS. This will help in determining whether the stream holds malicious executables or benign data.
  - **Review Recent Network Activities:** Utilize EDR or network logs to monitor the network activity associated with the identified process. Look for any connections to known malicious domains or anomalous data transfers that coincide with the ADS creation event.
  - **Incident Documentation and Coordination:** Document the investigation findings and coordinate with incident response teams for any further actions. If malicious behavior is confirmed, ensure to follow standard incident handling protocols including containment and eradication.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential association of executing hidden binaries, which can indicate active evasion techniques used by adversaries. It should be treated with a level of urgency given its implications on the security posture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot is that the rule may not trigger for legitimate applications that embed functionality within ADS for benign purposes, leading to false positives. Additionally, if the logging configurations are not correctly set to capture Imphash values, the rule may fail to fire. Adversaries may also employ techniques to zero out the Imphash, resulting in missed detections. Engineers should be aware that this could potentially allow malwares and exploits to evade detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential evasion techniques by monitoring the use of `regedit.exe` to export a registry key to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), a technique detailed under MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Defense Evasion" (T1564.004). Alternate Data Streams allow files to contain hidden data that may be used to obfuscate malicious activity, such as storing sensitive registry information outside of standard access paths. The detection mechanism leverages the creation of stream hashes, capturing relevant events where `regedit.exe` is responsible for creating the ADS, and correlates this with the `TargetFilename` field which specifies the file location of the created stream. This rule stands out, as abnormal usage of `regedit.exe` in this manner can indicate attempts by attackers to hide unauthorized changes or maintain persistence within the Windows environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to examine logs for recent executions of `regedit.exe`, noting any unusual command-line parameters that may indicate suspicious intents.
  - **Correlate with Alternate Data Streams:** Use Windows tools (like PowerShell) to check for hidden ADS related to the specified `TargetFilename`. Investigate if the data stored in the ADS correlates with known key information.
  - **Check for Registry Access:** Review Windows Security and Sysmon logs for any unauthorized modifications to the registry prior to the alert, and evaluate user permissions and roles that executed the command.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Utilize NDR logs to inspect any outbound connections made by the machine post-event to identify potential data exfiltration or communication with malicious infrastructure.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the inherent risks associated with hiding data in ADS, which can facilitate undetected malicious activity and persistent threats within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The main blind spot for this rule is the potential for legitimate administrative use of `regedit.exe`, leading to possible false positives. Additionally, if an attacker employs alternative methods to manipulate the registry without utilizing `regedit.exe`, such as direct registry API calls or other non-standard binary executions, this rule may not trigger. It also assumes that all relevant telemetry from Sysmon is operational and collecting data correctly.

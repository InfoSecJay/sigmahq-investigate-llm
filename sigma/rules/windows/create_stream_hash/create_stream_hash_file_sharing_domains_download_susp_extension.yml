  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious file downloads originating from a variety of known file sharing websites and paste services leveraged by threat actors. The rule focuses on the creation of stream hash data when files are accessed from these domains. Specifically, it looks for file types or formats commonly associated with malware, such as executables (`.exe`), dynamic link libraries (`.dll`), and scripts (`.vbs`, `.hta`). The primary sources of telemetry utilized by this rule are Sysmon logs, particularly those that capture events related to stream hash creation associated with files downloaded or accessed from suspicious domains. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** and the techniques of **Indicator Removal on Host** (T1564.004) and **Access Token Manipulation** (S0139).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for any simultaneous alerts tied to the specific file accesses identified. Correlate the timestamp of the alert with other malicious activity detected on the endpoint.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Inspect network traffic logs from NDR and NGFW to confirm connections made to the suspicious file sharing domains at the time of the alert. Identify any unusual outbound traffic patterns that may suggest data exfiltration.
  - **Review System Logs:** Access the Windows Event Logs, especially Sysmon's process creation and file access logs, to see details about the processes that initiated the downloads. Check if these processes exhibit signs of abnormal behavior or have high privilege levels.
  - **Investigate Contextual Data:** Use cloud platform logs to check for any abnormal API calls or activities surrounding the alert. Investigate if any user accounts associated with these downloads show patterns of suspicious access.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity of this alert reflects the potential for significant risk associated with file downloads from untrusted sources, which could lead to malware infections or data breaches in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if files are downloaded from less common or new file-sharing domains not included in the detection regex. Additionally, legitimate usage of these domains for benign purposes (such as personal or open-source projects) may trigger false positives, particularly with known code repositories like GitHub. Furthermore, adversaries might employ advanced evasion techniques, such as obfuscating the actual download source or using custom domains, thus bypassing detection.

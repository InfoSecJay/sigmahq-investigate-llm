  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the downloading of suspicious file types from URLs that directly reference IP addresses. The rule focuses on identifying file download activities that involve specific file extensions commonly associated with scripting and executable content, such as PowerShell scripts (.ps1), batch files (.bat), executables (.exe), and various other file types like Visual Basic scripts (.vbs) and OneNote files (.one). By analyzing the `create_stream_hash` telemetry, which captures file creation and modification events, the detection mechanism scrutinizes both the `Contents` and `TargetFilename` fields to find any instances where a file is being downloaded from a direct IP address, as indicated by the regular expression pattern for IP addresses. 
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically focusing on the tactic of Defense Evasion (TA0005) and the technique T1564.004 (Hide Artifacts: Network Share) which includes activities like downloading potentially harmful files to evade detection. Such downloads may indicate an attempt to introduce malware or malicious scripts into the environment, which necessitates immediate investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Look for alerts related to file downloads within the designated time frame and examine the endpoint activity for signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration attempts. Correlate these alerts with user behavior and system logs to assess the context of the file download.
  - **Review Firewall Logs:** Check network logs from the Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) for outbound connections to the identified IP addresses. Pay special attention to any high-risk protocols or unusual traffic patterns that might indicate suspicious activity.
  - **Explore Proxy Logs:** Investigate proxy logs to validate the userâ€™s access to the URLs and to ascertain if there were any previous abnormal access patterns to the same IP or domain. This could provide insights into user actions leading up to the alert.
  - **Scrutinize File Hashes:** If a malicious file is identified, utilize hash-based search against your antivirus and threat intelligence databases to find known malicious signatures and assess the potential impact on your organization.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is considered high due to the potential risk associated with downloading files from direct IP addresses, which may indicate malicious intent or compromise. Such downloads can lead to the introduction of malware or facilitate further attacks, requiring prompt attention from incident responders.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the malicious files are downloaded through HTTPS encryption that circumvents traditional monitoring methods, or if the attacker obfuscates the IP address to a domain name that is compliant with regular web traffic rules. Additionally, if the endpoint lacks Sysmon logging or proper file stream creation hashing, the detection will fail to trigger. It is also assumed that typical user behavior has been established; anomalies in network traffic may not be detected if historical baselines are lacking.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect suspicious scripting activities in Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Event Consumers, specifically focusing on the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands. WMI event consumers can be leveraged by attackers for persistence, enabling scripts that are executed in the background, often unnoticed. The rule looks for certain keywords and command structures indicative of PowerShell scripting techniques such as `new-object`, `net.webclient`, and encoded command execution (e.g., `iex('` or `-enc`). The primary data sources involved are Windows Security logs, specifically WMI-related event logs, which capture actions taken through WMI, providing insight into potentially anomalous behavior. This detection correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.005, which focuses on scripting and command execution through PowerShellâ€”critical methods utilized by attackers to execute payloads covertly.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check WMI Provider Logs:** Use Windows Event Viewer to examine the WMI provider logs for any suspicious scripts or unusual subscription activities tied to the identified event consumer.
  - **Analyze Process Creation:** Review the process creation logs via Sysmon to track if any unauthorized PowerShell scripts were initiated as a result of those WMI events.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Utilize EDR tools to monitor any outbound network connections that match the timeframe of the suspicious WMI events, paying close attention to connections related to unusual destinations.
  - **Review User Activity:** Correlate the user account associated with the detected WMI script execution to assess whether it aligns with legitimate administrative activity or indicates potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is rated high due to the potential for WMI-based persistence mechanisms to facilitate ongoing unauthorized access or control over the environment, often used in lateral movement and executing further malicious actions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not capture instances where legitimate administrative scripts utilize similar commands or structures, leading to false positives. Additionally, if an adversary leverages obfuscation techniques or modifies scripting patterns to evade detection, such activities may go unnoticed. It is assumed that the monitoring for WMI events is enabled and functioning correctly; if not, the rule will fail to fire.

  ### Technical Context
  The "WMI Event Subscription" detection rule is designed to identify suspicious activities related to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscriptions, which can be used as a persistence mechanism by attackers. The rule focuses on three specific Sysmon event IDs: 19 (WMI Event Filter Activity Detected), 20 (WMI Event Consumer Activity Detected), and 21 (WMI Event Consumer to Filter Activity Detected). By monitoring these events, the rule looks for abnormal or unauthorized creation of WMI filters and consumers that may indicate malicious intent to execute code or maintain persistence on a target system without detection. 
  These events can indicate advanced persistence strategies commonly leveraged by attackers, mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Persistence" tactic (Attack ID T1546.003). The detection relies on telemetry from Sysmon and focuses specifically on the creation and manipulation of WMI filters and consumers, which are crucial components of the WMI event subscription system involved in system monitoring and control.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs:** Review Sysmon event logs for Event IDs 19, 20, and 21. Look for any unexpected filters or consumers and their associated command lines or scripts.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize the EDR solution to check for related process activity around the time of the WMI events. Look for any suspicious processes that may interact with these events.
  - **Review Permissions:** Investigate the user accounts that triggered the events. Ensure that these accounts have the necessary permissions for legitimate administrative tasks and assess whether they exhibit anomalous behavior.
  - **Examine Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs to detect any outbound or suspicious connections from the processes associated with the identified WMI events. This step can help reveal whether the events are part of a broader campaign or standalone actions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity because while WMI event subscriptions can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, their misuse often indicates an attempt by adversaries to gain persistent access. Therefore, further investigation is crucial to establish context and intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where WMI event subscriptions are created using tools or methods that do not generate Sysmon event logs, or where legitimate programs use these subscriptions in approved contexts. Additionally, if an attacker has the ability to evade logging (for example, by disabling Sysmon or using alternative techniques), this detection may not trigger. It is essential for detection engineers to understand the environment and the baseline of legitimate use cases to minimize false positives and improve detection efficacy.

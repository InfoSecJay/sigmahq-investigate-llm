  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious behaviors associated with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event consumers by inspecting the content of WMI scripts for suspicious encoded payloads. Specifically, it looks for the presence of notable strings such as "WriteProcessMemory" and specific error messages indicative of Windows executable characteristics, such as "This program cannot be run in DOS mode" and "This program must be run under Win32." By leveraging WMI events, attackers can maintain persistence and execute arbitrary code in a stealthy manner, which is why this technique falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of execution (T1047) and persistence (T1546.003). The rule relies on WMI event logs, enabling the detection of unusual patterns or encoded scripts that could signify malicious intent or exploitation attempts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review WMI Event Logs:** Check WMI event logs for any events that triggered this alert and examine the associated user and operation data for unusual activity.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize the EDR system to identify any related malicious process executions and to observe the lifecycle of any processes that appeared around the time of the WMI event detection.
  - **Analyze Parent-Child Process Relationships:** Investigate the parent-child relationships of processes spawned from WMI events to discern if any suspicious executables are being launched, particularly those that reference encoded scripts.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Examine network logs to see if any outbound connections originated from the detected processes that could indicate data exfiltration or communication with command and control (C2) servers.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule are categorized as high severity due to the potential for significant compromise; encoded scripts in WMI consumers can enable persistent attack vectors and facilitate further exploitation, which could lead to data breaches or system takeovers.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the encoded scripts do not contain the specific strings being searched for or if the attacker employs obfuscation techniques that evade detection. Additionally, legitimate use of encoded scripts for administrative purposes could result in false positives. It is also assumed that adequate WMI logging is enabled and properly configured for all critical systems; otherwise, malicious actions may go unobserved.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect instances of remote thread creation initiated by PowerShell processes targeting uncommon executables, such as `rundll32.exe` and `regsvr32.exe`. The rule focuses on identifying the specific behavior where PowerShell creates a remote thread in another process, which is a technique often used by attackers to execute malicious code within the context of another process without raising immediate alarms. The detection relies on telemetry from Windows Sysmon, specifically monitoring the `create_remote_thread` event. This behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059.001 
  - PowerShell) and Defense Evasion (T1218.011 
  - Remote Thread Injection).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts**: Review the EDR console for alerts related to remote thread creations associated with PowerShell processes, focusing on the timestamps and involved processes.
  - **Examine PowerShell Logs**: Investigate PowerShell execution logs to determine if any suspicious commands or scripts were run at the identified times, correlating with the remote thread creation events.
  - **Analyze Affected Process Behavior**: Utilize process monitoring tools to inspect the behavior of the target processes (e.g., `rundll32.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`) to identify unusual activity or indicators of compromise.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic**: Look at network logs for any outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts linked to the time frame of the remote thread creation events to assess potential data breaches.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential presence of malicious activity masquerading as legitimate process behavior. While this activity may not be indicative of a confirmed breach, it warrants further investigation to assess the risk to the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if an adversary employs less common PowerShell script names or utilizes process names not captured in the rule's conditions. Additionally, if the organization has highly customized or less typical execution environments where uncommon processes are frequently used for legitimate purposes, false negatives could occur. It's assumed that all PowerShell activity is monitored adequately; any gaps in PowerShell logging or Sysmon configuration may result in undetected behavior.

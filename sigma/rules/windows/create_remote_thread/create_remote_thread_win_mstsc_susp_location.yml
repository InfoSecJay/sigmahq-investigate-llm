title: Remote Thread Creation In Mstsc.Exe From Suspicious Location
id: c0aac16a-b1e7-4330-bab0-3c27bb4987c7
status: test
description: |
  Detects remote thread creation in the "mstsc.exe" process by a process located in a potentially suspicious location.
  This technique is often used by attackers in order to hook some APIs used by DLLs loaded by "mstsc.exe" during RDP authentications in order to steal credentials.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects instances of remote thread creation in the `mstsc.exe` process, which is the Microsoft Terminal Services Client used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. It focuses on identifying source processes that create threads within `mstsc.exe` from suspicious or uncommon directories, such as `Temp`, `Public`, and other non-standard locations. Attackers may exploit this technique as part of their credential theft efforts, injecting code into `mstsc.exe` to capture sensitive information during RDP sessions. The rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK frameworkâ€™s tactic of **Credential Access** (specifically the technique T1550.001: Use Alternate Authentication Material), as it can potentially allow unauthorized access to user credentials through the compromised RDP session.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review EDR logs for alerts related to the identified process, focusing on any unusual behaviors, such as additional process creation or modifications to `mstsc.exe`.
  - **Analyze Source Process:** Investigate the source process that triggered the alert by checking its execution path and confirming if it resides in one of the suspicious directories listed in the rule.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize network connection logs to ascertain if any unusual outbound connections were made around the time of the remote thread creation, which could indicate potential exfiltration of captured credentials.
  - **Examine Logs for User Activity:** Consult Windows Security logs for any unauthorized access attempts or logon events related to the affected user accounts, especially around the time of the incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive credentials during RDP sessions, which can lead to further compromise of systems and data within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses `mstsc.exe` from standard or expected directories or if they employ stealth techniques to avoid detection, such as renaming the malicious executable or utilizing legitimate processes for their attacks. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate system maintenance tasks or software operating in the identified paths. Therefore, it is critical to maintain a thorough understanding of normal operational behavior and review the contexts surrounding any alerts before taking action.

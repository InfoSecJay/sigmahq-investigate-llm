  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential CCleanerReactivator.DLL Sideloading" is designed to identify suspicious loading of the `CCleanerReactivator.dll` in a Windows environment. This detection rule specifically looks for instances where the `CCleanerReactivator.dll` is loaded through potential malicious means, indicating a possible DLL sideloading attack, which is a technique used by adversaries to bypass security measures and execute payloads. The rule focuses on the Windows image load events and employs filter conditions to ensure that the DLL is loaded only from legitimate application directories associated with CCleaner, such as `C:\Program Files\CCleaner\` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\CCleaner\`, while being careful to exclude instances where it is executed from unapproved paths. This alert aligns with several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, including defense evasion (T1574.001 
  - DLL Search Order Hijacking), persistence (T1574.002 
  - DLL Sideloading), and privilege escalation tactics.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the EDR for any related alerts around the time of the DLL load event to identify if the activity was potentially staged as part of a larger attack.
  - **Correlate with Image Load Events:** Investigate the image load events in the Windows Sysmon logs to correlate the loaded DLL path with its parent process and any other associated process creation events.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Inspect the command-line arguments of the process that triggered the alert to identify any suspicious parameters that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Look for Impacted Systems:** Query the proxy and firewall logs to determine if there were any unusual outbound connections from the system where the alert was triggered, which may indicate a compromised host exfiltrating data.
  ### Prioritization
  Given its medium severity level, this alert indicates a potential compromise through DLL sideloading, which may lead to consequential threats like privilege escalation. Prompt investigation is advised as these activities could be a precursor to more extensive exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses different DLL names or installs CCleaner in custom paths that are not covered by the filtering criteria. Furthermore, it operates under the assumption that all legitimate installations of CCleaner are made from its official directories, which may not always be the case in environments with diverse software provisions. Additionally, altered Image Load events may evade detection if adversaries use techniques designed to conceal their activities, such as manipulating their processes or employing alternative DLLs altogether.

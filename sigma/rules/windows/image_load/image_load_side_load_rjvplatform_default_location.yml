  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the potential abuse of DLL side-loading via the `SystemResetPlatform.exe` executable in Windows. Specifically, it looks for the loading of the `RjvPlatform.dll` file from an atypical default location, namely `C:\$SysReset\Framework\Stack\RjvPlatform.dll`, which is not typically created by the system. The rule leverages image load events logged by Sysmon, particularly focusing on processes that may be evading detection through the use of a legitimate executable to load a malicious DLL. This practice falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of **Defense Evasion** and **Privilege Escalation**, specifically techniques T1574.001 (DLL Search Order Hijacking) and T1574.002 (DLL Side-Loading). A detection of this type is crucial as it signifies a subtle method of executing potentially harmful code while maintaining a connection to a legitimate system process.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution**: Use your EDR solution to verify the execution of `SystemResetPlatform.exe` within the endpoint's process list and confirm its parent processes for any suspicious activity.
    
  - **Analyze DLL Origin**: Investigate the `RjvPlatform.dll` file properties, checking its creation date, digital signature, and any indicators of compromise (IoCs) to determine if it belongs to trusted software.
  - **Review Sysmon Logs**: Access Sysmon logs for additional context around the image load event to ascertain the sequence of actions leading to the DLL loading, checking for any additional anomalies.
  - **Cross-Reference Network Activity**: Investigate network logs for any unusual outbound traffic from `SystemResetPlatform.exe` that may indicate command and control (C2) communication patterns exploited during this attack.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for privilege escalation and abuse of legitimate processes, which can facilitate further intrusion into the network. Incidents of this nature warrant immediate investigation due to the risk associated with unrecognized DLLs executed in the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `SystemResetPlatform.exe` is benignly executing in legitimate circumstances, diminishing the detection's utility. Additionally, if an adversary employs a different binary or location for DLL side-loading, or if security logging is insufficiently configured, the detection may fail to trigger. It's essential for engineers to be aware that not all malicious DLLs will originate from this particular path or process, and regular review of the logic against real-world usage patterns is necessary.

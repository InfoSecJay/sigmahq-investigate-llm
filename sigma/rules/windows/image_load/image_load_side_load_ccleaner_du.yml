  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential DLL sideloading involving the "CCleanerDU.dll" file in a Windows environment. DLL sideloading is a technique used by adversaries to execute malicious code by masquerading it within a legitimate process. This rule specifically looks for instances where "CCleanerDU.dll" is being loaded, but only when the process responsible for loading it is either "CCleaner.exe" or "CCleaner64.exe," indicating a possible attempt to exploit these trusted applications for malicious purposes. The detection leverages Windows Event Logs, particularly focusing on image load events to track when specific dynamic link library (DLL) files are executed. The associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this rule include T1574.001 and T1574.002, which relate to defense evasion and persistence via DLL sideloading.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review DLL Loading Events:** Utilize Sysmon logs to check for image load events related to "CCleanerDU.dll" to confirm if it originated from a non-standard path or unauthorized process.
  - **Examine Process Parentage:** Investigate the parent process of both "CCleanerDU.dll" and related executable files (like "CCleaner.exe") using EDR tools to discern if the process tree appears suspicious or anomalous.
  - **Inspect Security Event Logs:** Review Windows Security logs for any corresponding event IDs that indicate privilege escalation or suspicious activities associated with "CCleaner" installations.
  - **Analyze Artifact Paths:** Check the installation paths of CCleaner via Application logs. Validate if the loaded DLL is part of the legitimate installation directory or if it points to any potentially malicious or custom locations.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has a medium severity level due to the potential implications of DLL sideloading, which can result in privilege escalation or evasion of security controls. In enterprise settings, this could lead to unauthorized access or execution of malicious payloads, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if "CCleanerDU.dll" is loaded from custom or non-standard locations that are not anticipated by the filter criteria. Additionally, legitimate applications that load this DLL with similar characteristics could trigger false positives. Engineers should consider adding custom paths to the exclusion list as necessary and remain aware that advanced adversaries may employ techniques to conceal their activities, potentially bypassing detection.

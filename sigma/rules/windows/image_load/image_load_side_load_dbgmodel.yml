  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential instances of DLL sideloading specifically for the "DbgModel.dll" file. DLL sideloading is a technique where an attacker leverages a legitimate applicationâ€™s loading of a DLL to execute malicious code, often to evade detection. This rule monitors for instances when "DbgModel.dll" is loaded into memory from unauthorized paths outside its expected locations, such as subdirectories of `C:\Windows\System32`, `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`, or `C:\Windows\WinSxS`. The rule identifies occurrences of this DLL being loaded using the 'ImageLoaded' event from Windows Sysmon logs, narrowing down paths that are deemed suspicious. It references MITRE ATT&CK technique T1574.002 (DLL Side-Loading), which falls under the defense evasion tactic, emphasizing its relevance for threat detection and incident response.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review EDR solutions for any alerts or anomalous behavior associated with the process that triggered the alert, specifically examining the loaded DLLs and their parent processes.
  - **Review Sysmon Logs:** Query Sysmon logs for recent process creation events linked to the process where the "DbgModel.dll" was loaded, paying attention to command-line arguments that might indicate malicious intent.
  - **Analyze File Integrity:** Use file integrity monitoring tools to check the hash of the "DbgModel.dll" file in question against known good versions to verify its legitimacy.
  - **Examine Network Connections:** Look for unusual outbound network connections made by the application that loaded the DLL, which may indicate attempts to communicate with a command-and-control infrastructure.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium because while the presence of this alert does not guarantee malicious activity, it highlights potential misuse of application behavior that could lead to a successful evasion tactic. Prompt investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the DLL loading.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses a legitimate application configured to load "DbgModel.dll" from an allowed path or if the DLL is loaded by a less monitored process. Additionally, if an attacker modifies the DLL to have a valid signature or uses alternative names, detection may be bypassed. There is an assumption that the environment adequately monitors the relevant Sysmon logs, as configurations or lack of logging could lead to missed detections.

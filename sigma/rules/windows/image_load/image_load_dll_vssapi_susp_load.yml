  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect the suspicious loading of the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) API DLL, specifically `vssapi.dll`, by executables that are not commonly associated with its legitimate use. Typical usage of `vssapi.dll` is linked with system processes like Windows Explorer or backup applications; however, if it is loaded by unusual executables, it may indicate malicious behavior, such as an attacker attempting to manipulate shadow copies for data exfiltration or to evade detection. The rule leverages the `image_load` log source to monitor when `vssapi.dll` is loaded and uses filtering criteria to ensure the detection focuses on uncommon executable paths that do not typically load this DLL. This rule is related to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics "Defense Evasion" and "Impact," specifically technique T1490.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze the Alert in EDR**: Use the EDR tool to check the endpoint where the alert was triggered by investigating process trees and recent activities related to the executable that loaded `vssapi.dll`.
  - **Review Process Execution Logs**: Examine Windows Security event logs for indications of process creation, especially focusing on the command line used to launch the executing process, to determine if it matches expected patterns.
  - **Check Network Connections**: Utilize the network detection tools to see if any unusual connections were made by the executable post loading `vssapi.dll`, which may indicate data exfiltration or further malicious activity.
  - **Inspect File System Changes**: Review file creation, modification, or deletion logs in directories related to shadow copies, looking for any unauthorized changes that align with the suspicious loading of `vssapi.dll`.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is tagged as high severity due to the critical nature of the Volume Shadow Copy functionality and its potential use by attackers to hide their tracks or maintain persistence. Rapid investigation is necessary to mitigate potential impacts on data integrity and availability.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire if the loading of `vssapi.dll` occurs within a legitimate or known application that is not covered by the specified filters, such as internal backup tools. Additionally, the rule assumes that the executables responsible for loading the DLL are indeed not part of any legitimate processes within the environment. Adversaries may also modify the features of known applications to avoid detection, making it essential for responders to have contextual awareness of all applications in use.

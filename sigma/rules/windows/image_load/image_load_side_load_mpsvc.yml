  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential DLL sideloading of the "MpSvc.dll" file, which is a component of Microsoft Defender Antivirus. DLL sideloading is a technique used by adversaries to execute malicious code by masquerading as a legitimate DLL, thereby evading detection. The rule leverages the `image_load` logs provided by Sysmon, specifically looking for instances where `MpSvc.dll` is loaded from paths outside trusted directories such as `C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\`, `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\`, and `C:\Windows\WinSxS\`. By identifying instances where the DLL is loaded from untrusted locations, the rule aims to pinpoint potential instances of malware execution using the legitimate DLL. This can be mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1574.002, which covers techniques involving DLL side-loading for evading defenses.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review any associated EDR alerts for abnormal behavior on systems where the alert was triggered. Look for any processes that may have spawned around the same time as the unexpected loading of `MpSvc.dll`.
  - **Verify DLL Path:** Investigate the path from which `MpSvc.dll` was loaded. Confirm whether it aligns with the expected directories for legitimate software or if it appears suspicious.
  - **Examine Process Activity:** Use process monitoring tools to analyze any related processes that interacted with `MpSvc.dll`. Check for unusual command-line parameters or parent-child process relationships that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Review System Logs:** Search through Windows Security, System, and Application logs for anomalous events correlating to the time of the DLL load. Pay attention to local user activities or elevated permissions that may enable DLL sideloading.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for significant risk if an adversary successfully sideloads a malicious DLL, which can compromise the integrity of the system. The presence of this alert should warrant a thorough investigation to determine if there is a genuine threat.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under circumstances where legitimate software improperly sideloads its own copies of `MpSvc.dll`, constituting a possible false positive. Additionally, the rule assumes that Sysmon is configured correctly to log these image load events and that the environment is free from tampering. If an attacker employs sophisticated obfuscation techniques or compromises trusted software, they may bypass this detection.

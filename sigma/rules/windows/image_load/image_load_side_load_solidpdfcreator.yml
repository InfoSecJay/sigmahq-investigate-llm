  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potential SolidPDFCreator.DLL Sideloading" focuses on identifying potential DLL sideloading attempts involving the "SolidPDFCreator.dll" file. Sideloading occurs when a malicious application loads a non-genuine or tampered dynamic link library (DLL) to execute malicious code, leveraging legitimate software to bypass security measures. This rule specifically looks for instances where the "SolidPDFCreator.dll" is loaded by the "SolidPDFCreator.exe" executable, with the loading process occurring from predefined paths associated with the legitimate software. By monitoring the image load events, the rule can flag suspicious activity that could indicate attempts to exploit the application.
  This rule is tied to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, specifically under "Defense Evasion" (T1574.001: DLL Search Order Hijacking) and "Privilege Escalation" (T1574.002: DLL Side-Loading). The telemetry monitoring capabilities utilized are derived from Windows Sysmon's image load events, which capture details about DLL loading behaviors, making it a pivotal component in the detection of this evasion technique.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Executable Origin:** Use EDR tools to confirm the legitimacy of the "SolidPDFCreator.exe" process by comparing its hash against known software repositories and checking publisher details.
  - **Analyze DLL Path:** Confirm that the "SolidPDFCreator.dll" is being loaded from one of the expected directories using Windows Sysmon logs, reviewing the full image path to rule out manipulation.
  - **Review Accompanying Activities:** Investigate other security logs (e.g., process creation and network connection logs) around the same time frame to uncover any additional security incidents or anomalous activities related to the same process.
  - **Correlate User Context:** Check user accounts associated with the execution of the "SolidPDFCreator.exe" for any signs of compromise or unusual behavior, such as administrative access requests or privilege escalations.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level of this alert suggests that while the detection does not confirm malicious activity, it indicates a potential security risk that warrants further investigation, particularly considering the potential for privilege escalation and evasion techniques employed by attackers.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the "SolidPDFCreator.dll" is loaded from an unexpected path not covered by the detection criteria or if the malicious process mimics the legitimate executable without utilizing known DLLs. Additionally, variances in deployment environments or updates to the SolidPDFCreator software may result in alternative loading behaviors that bypass this detection. Engineers should consider that sophisticated adversaries may use custom DLL paths or techniques to evade detection, thus necessitating continuous review and adaptation of the rule.

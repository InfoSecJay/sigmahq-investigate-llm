  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Active Directory Parsing DLL Loaded Via Office Application" is designed to identify instances where the `DSParse.dll` library is loaded by various Microsoft Office applications, specifically Excel, Publisher, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. This behavior is notable as the loading of such a DLL by a legitimate application could indicate potential exploitation techniques employed by threat actors, particularly in the context of information gathering through Active Directory environments. This detection leverages Windows Image Load events, focusing on process creation logs where the `Image Loaded` data includes `dsparse.dll`. 
  This rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Execution tactic (T1204.002), highlighting the indirect execution through user application interactions, which can often be a precursor to further malicious activities in the environment. By monitoring for this specific combination of Office applications and the indicated DLL, security operations teams can gain insight into potentially malicious behaviors that may otherwise evade traditional security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Check the enterprise EDR solution for any additional alerts related to the processes (`excel.exe`, `winword.exe`, etc.) that loaded `dsparse.dll`. Assess the timeline and associated user activities that might indicate misuse.
  - **Analyze Sysmon Logs**: Utilize Sysmon logs to conduct a detailed examination of the identified event, focusing on the process creation and image load events. Investigate the parent-child process relationships to understand the context of how the Office application was invoked.
  - **Correlate with Proxy Logs**: Look at proxy logs for any unusual web traffic associated with the user during the timeframe of the Office application execution. Investigate any external connections that may indicate command and control or data exfiltration efforts.
  - **Inspect User Account Activity**: Examine user account logs in Active Directory for any suspicious actions taken by the user prior to or after the DLL load event. Pay particular attention to failed logins, privilege escalations, and any logon activity outside of normal patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the association with potential adversarial tactics against a critical infrastructure component, specifically Active Directory. Any instance of `dsparse.dll` being loaded within trusted Office applications warrants immediate investigation to determine if malicious intent is involved.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that the environment has comprehensive Sysmon logging enabled and configured correctly to capture image load events. It may not fire if `dsparse.dll` is obfuscated, renamed, or executed in a manner that does not involve the targeted Office applications. Furthermore, if an attacker uses a different technique or employs alternative methods of invoking the DLL, this rule would not trigger. Analysts should consider that legitimate administrative or configuration activities involving Office applications might also cause false positives.

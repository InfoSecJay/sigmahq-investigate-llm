  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential DLL sideloading activities concerning the Wazuh security platform by monitoring image load events in a Windows environment. Specifically, it looks for the loading of certain DLL files, namely `libwazuhshared.dll` and `libwinpthread-1.dll`, particularly when those DLLs are sourced from non-standard directories such as user-specific locations (`\AppData\Local\` or `\ProgramData\`). By analyzing the paths from which these DLL files are loaded, this detection mechanism identifies potential abuse patterns typical of adversaries attempting to bypass security measures, allowing them to achieve persistence or escalate privileges. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation (T1574.001, T1574.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine EDR Alerts:** Investigate any corresponding EDR alerts that may indicate suspicious activity related to user processes or DLL loading behaviors tied to the identified libraries.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs for process creation events associated with the loading of these DLLs, focusing on command-line parameters and parent processes to determine the legitimacy of the activity.
  - **Analyze File System Changes:** Look for modifications and creations of files within `C:\Program Files\`, `C:\Program Files (x86)\`, and user directories (`\AppData\Local\` and `\ProgramData\`) that may correlate with the suspicious DLLs being loaded.
  - **Investigate Network Connections:** Check for any associated outbound network connections (via EDR/NDR tools) originating from processes that have loaded these DLLs, as this could indicate malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential of DLL sideloading to facilitate malicious activities like persistence and privilege escalation, which could compromise system integrity and security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger if the suspicious DLL files are loaded from recognized directories (e.g., standard program installation paths), or if legitimate applications in trusted environments utilize those DLLs, leading to false positives. Additionally, if users or adversaries manipulate processes to load the DLLs in a stealthy manner or change their paths, the detection may be circumvented. Analysts should remain aware that several benign applications also utilize these DLLs, necessitating thorough context examination of each alert to avoid misclassification.

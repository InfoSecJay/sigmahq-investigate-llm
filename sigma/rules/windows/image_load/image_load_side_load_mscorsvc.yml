  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential DLL sideloading of the `mscorsvc.dll`, a crucial component of the Microsoft .NET Framework. DLL sideloading occurs when a malicious actor places a malicious DLL file alongside a legitimate executable, leading it to load the malicious file instead of the intended one. This can result in unauthorized code execution on the system. The rule focuses on **Windows Image Load** events and looks specifically for instances where `mscorsvc.dll` is loaded from other than legitimate paths, particularly from directories associated with the .NET Framework. The rule is referencing the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1574.002, which falls under the tactic of Defense Evasion, highlighting the method's nature of circumventing security measures.
  To detect this behavior, the rule inspects the paths of loaded images on Windows systems using telemetry from Sysmon, which logs detailed information about process creation and image loading activities. By analyzing the `ImageLoaded` field for paths that do not meet the expected legitimate directory criteria (e.g., `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\` or `C:\Windows\WinSxS\`), the rule can surface alerts when suspicious loading activity is detected.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Image Load Events:** Check EDR or Sysmon logs for instances where `mscorsvc.dll` was loaded. Focus on the associated processes to determine if they are legitimate or exhibit suspicious behavior.
    
  - **Analyze Process Creation:** Verify the parent process that initiated the loading of `mscorsvc.dll` through Windows Event Logs, especially from the `Security` and `Sysmon` logs. This helps to trace if the DLL was invoked by a known or unknown application.
    
  - **Inspect File Integrity:** Use Antivirus or EDR tools to conduct a file integrity check on `mscorsvc.dll` by comparing it against known safe hashes. This can help confirm whether the file has been tampered with.
    
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Review network logs (NDR/NGFW) for unusual outbound traffic from the process that loaded the DLL. This may reveal potential command and control communication or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered medium due to the potential risk associated with DLL sideloading which can lead to execution of malicious code. However, it is critical to verify the legitimacy of the loading context and process to avoid false positives.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the paths defined in the filters are the only legitimate locations for `mscorsvc.dll`. It might not fire if an attacker successfully disguises their malicious DLL within one of these directories, or if legitimate applications are modifying the expected loading behavior by running from unmonitored custom paths. Additionally, if imaging logging is not enabled or misconfigured, this rule may not operate effectively, missing potential detection opportunities.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on detecting potential DLL sideloading of "AVKkid.dll," which can be a method used by adversaries to execute malicious code by loading a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file alongside a seemingly legitimate executable. The rule specifically examines Windows image load events to identify when "AVKkid.dll" is loaded into memory. It looks for instances where this DLL is loaded from directories associated with the legitimate G DATA software, checking for potentially suspicious execution patterns. The rule leverages **Sysmon's image load logs** to monitor the origins of DLL files and their corresponding process creation details, ensuring that the file path matches known legitimate application paths but also flags any deviations as potential indicators of compromise. This detection aligns with multiple tactics and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly those related to **Defense Evasion (T1574)** and **Privilege Escalation (T1574.001 and T1574.002)**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Sysmon Image Load Events:** Start by querying Windows Sysmon image load events for instances of "AVKkid.dll" and correlate those with process creation logs to identify the origins of processes that load this DLL.
  - **Check Process Details:** Investigate the associated parent processes and command-line arguments of the processes that loaded "AVKkid.dll" to determine if they deviate from standard operational behaviors.
  - **Examine Legitimate Paths:** Validate the image loading paths to ascertain that they indeed align with known G DATA installation directories, identifying any anomalies or unauthorized changes to these paths.
  - **Utilize EDR for In-depth Analysis:** Leverage EDR tools to perform a deeper investigation into the execution flow of the processes in question, including examining user behavior and access logs for any related suspicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is considered medium, given that potential DLL sideloading may indicate an attempt to evade detection mechanisms and could lead to further privilege escalation or malicious activities within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if "AVKkid.dll" is loaded from a legitimate path that has not been accounted for, or if the malicious DLL is obfuscated or renamed to appear harmless. Additionally, it assumes that Sysmon is configured correctly to log image loading events, which may not be the case in all environments. Attackers can also manipulate the file paths or utilize other legitimate tools to execute their payloads, rendering the rule less effective.

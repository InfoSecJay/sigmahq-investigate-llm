  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies when a system process on a Windows machine, particularly those located in the `C:\Windows\` directory (such as `System32` or `SysWOW64`), loads a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) from suspicious locations known for permissive permissions, including `C:\Users\Public` and `C:\PerfLogs`. Such behavior is a common tactic used by adversaries for evading detection, as they attempt to exploit trusted system processes to execute malicious payloads from directories that may not be strictly monitored. This detection utilizes **Sysmon** image load events, specifically filtering for images that begin with designated paths associated with critical Windows directories and checking if the loaded DLL originates from less secure directories. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic for this rule falls under **Defense Evasion** (T1070).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Information:** Examine the **Process Creation** logs in Sysmon or EDR to trace the parent process that initiated the loading of the suspicious DLL. Correlate this with the user's activity to determine if it aligns with legitimate activities.
  - **Review Loaded DLLs:** Utilize the Sysinternals tool `ListDLLs` or EDR capabilities to list all loaded DLLs for the identified process. Specifically, scrutinize any DLLs loaded from suspicious directories indicated in the alert.
  - **Check Permissions:** Analyze the file or directory permissions of the loaded DLL in question, including whether it inherits permissions that could allow for unauthorized access or execution to ensure it hasn't been manipulated.
  - **Review Recent Changes:** Investigate any recent changes to the DLL in suspect locations using Windows Security logs or file integrity monitoring solutions to see if the file has been altered recently or if new entries have appeared that coincide with the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is rated as medium because while not all instances of DLL loads from these locations are necessarily malicious, the activity warrants attention due to the potential to indicate a compromise or evasion technique being employed by an adversary.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the suspicious DLL is loaded directly by a user-initiated process instead of a system process. Additionally, if an adversary creates specifically crafted directories that mimic legitimate ones, it may evade detection. The effectiveness of this rule relies on maintaining current and comprehensive definitions of suspicious directories to monitor, as new locations may emerge over time that require updates. It is also assumed that Sysmon is appropriately configured and logging image load events accurately.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential DLL sideloading attempts via the VMware Xfer utility. Specifically, it monitors the loading of the `glib-2.0.dll` library when invoked from the `VMwareXferlogs.exe` executable. The rule focuses on situations where this DLL is loaded from a non-default installation path of VMware, indicating a possible malicious attempt to leverage the legitimate utility for arbitrary code execution. By analyzing the `image_load` logs from Windows, the rule is able to flag these events, which might signify an evasion technique commonly associated with threats such as ransomware or other illicit activities.
  The detection works by checking if the `Image` path ends with `VMwareXferlogs.exe` and concurrently verifies that the `ImageLoaded` path corresponds to `glib-2.0.dll`. To reduce false positives, it ensures that the DLL is being loaded from the expected path, namely `C:\Program Files\VMware\`, but only flags events when this expectation is not met.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review EDR logs to identify the process creation events around the time of the alert to ascertain whether any suspicious processes were launched.
  - Analyze the command-line arguments of `VMwareXferlogs.exe` using process logs to check for any unusual parameters that may indicate malicious intent.
  - Query the file system for the presence of `glib-2.0.dll` to investigate its origin, ensuring itâ€™s not modified or sourced from a non-standard directory.
  - Consult the network logs to trace any outbound connections made by the VMware utility, which may help identify further indicators of compromise associated with the alert.

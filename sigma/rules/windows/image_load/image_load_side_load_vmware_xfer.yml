  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential DLL sideloading attacks occurring through the VMware Xfer utility. DLL sideloading is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL file in a location that is loaded by a legitimate application, such as VMware, potentially allowing for the execution of arbitrary code. Specifically, the rule monitors the image load events for the VMware Xfer logs executable (`VMwareXferlogs.exe`) and checks if it is loading a DLL named `glib-2.0.dll` from a non-default directory. The data sources involved in this detection include Windows Sysmon image load logs, capturing both the loading of executables and their dependent libraries. In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this rule aligns with the defense evasion tactics (T1574.002, DLL side-loading), indicating attempts by adversaries to obscure their malicious activities by leveraging legitimate processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Investigate any alerts from the EDR related to `VMwareXferlogs.exe`, focusing on process creation logs to identify the context in which this tool was executed.
  - **Analyze Process Tree:** Utilize EDR to examine the parent-child relationship of the processes spawned by `VMwareXferlogs.exe` to uncover any unusual or unexpected behavior that could indicate malicious actions.
  - **Review Sysmon Logs:** Query Sysmon image load logs for entries related to the loading of `glib-2.0.dll` and confirm its path, especially if it deviates from the standard VMware installation directories.
  - **Evaluate Network Activity:** Analyze any corresponding network connections using NDR tools to identify outbound communications that may suggest further malicious activity associated with the DLL being loaded.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for malicious code execution through a trusted application, which can lead to significant impact on the organizationâ€™s security posture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses a different naming scheme for the DLL or if VMware is installed in a non-standard directory not accounted for in the filter. Additionally, if an unauthorized user has legitimate access to the VMware utility, the activity may appear benign, leading to false negatives. It is assumed that all necessary telemetry is collected, including Sysmon image load logs; without this, the detection will not function as intended.

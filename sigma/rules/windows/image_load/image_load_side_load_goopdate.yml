  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potential Goopdate.DLL Sideloading" is designed to identify the malicious use of the `goopdate.dll` file, which is often associated with Googleâ€™s update process through `googleupdate.exe`. The rule tracks instances where `goopdate.dll` is loaded by monitoring Windows image load events. Specifically, it looks for instances where `goopdate.dll` is loaded from uncommon paths, while also filtering out legitimate uses of this DLL in standard application directories such as `C:\Program Files` and `C:\Program Files (x86)`. The rule implementation leverages the Windows Sysmon logs, focusing particularly on image load events, and it is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for privilege escalation (T1574.001 and T1574.002) and defense evasion. By emphasizing specific file paths and incorporating various filters, the rule aims to minimize false positives that could arise from legitimate applications, such as custom Chromium-based browsers or installations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs:** Review Sysmon logs for image load events related to `goopdate.dll` to determine the loading process, checking for unusual parent processes or locations to avoid benign events.
  - **Analyze Related Processes:** Investigate the process tree of the detected `goopdate.dll` loading, focusing on the parent process IDs and the contexts in which `googleupdate.exe` or other related executables are running.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize your EDR tools to analyze any outgoing network connections made by the process that loaded `goopdate.dll`, focusing on any suspicious domains or IP addresses that correlate to known malicious activity.
  - **Check File Modifications:** Inspect file system changes in the directories leading to instances of `goopdate.dll`, especially looking for any anomalies in the `AppData` and temp directories that might indicate payloads being delivered.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for alerts triggered by this rule is marked as medium due to the potential for misuse of a legitimate DLL in privilege escalation attempts, signifying a risk that warrants further investigation without suggesting immediate high threat levels commonly associated with confirmed malware.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate applications use `goopdate.dll` in non-standard paths or benign processes that replicate typical loading behaviors. Additionally, there is an assumption that all image load activities are logged consistently in Sysmon; any misconfiguration could prevent detection. It is also acknowledged that sophisticated adversaries could bypass this detection by mimicking legitimate loading behaviors or using alternate loading techniques, potentially leading to missed detections.

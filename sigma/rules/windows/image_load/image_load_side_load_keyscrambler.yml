  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious behavior associated with the DLL sideloading technique, particularly the loading of a potentially malicious DLL named "KeyScramblerIE.dll" by the legitimate executable "KeyScrambler.exe." DLL sideloading is a method often exploited by threat actors and malware to load malicious payloads during the execution of trusted applications, thereby evading detection. The Sigma rule focuses on process creation and image loading logs to monitor for instances where "KeyScrambler.exe" or its logon counterpart attempts to load "KeyScramblerIE.dll." The technical data sources involved primarily include Windows Sysmon logs related to image loading (`ImageLoaded`) and process execution. This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1574.001 (DLL Side-Loading) and T1574.002 (Trusted Developer Utilities).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events**: Use EDR tools to examine process creation events for "KeyScrambler.exe" and "KeyScramblerLogon.exe" around the time of the alert. Look for unusual command-line arguments that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Analyze Loaded DLLs**: Utilize Sysmon logs to confirm if "KeyScramblerIE.dll" was loaded by the aforementioned executables. Verify the path and signature of the loaded DLL to rule out legitimate use.
  - **Check for Anomalies in the Environment**: Investigate any recent changes or installations of the KeyScrambler software. Look in software inventory and application logs for additional context on the software deployment.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence**: Cross-reference the alert with threat intelligence sources to check for known malicious signatures or indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to "KeyScramblerIE.dll" and its associations with threat actors.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because DLL sideloading can lead to successful execution of malicious code, potentially resulting in privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Immediate investigation is warranted to mitigate potential risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in the following scenarios: if attackers use a different execution method to load the DLL, if the legitimate application is executed from an unexpected or non-standard path, or if the execution context is altered (e.g., running with different user credentials that bypass monitoring). Additionally, this detection assumes that "KeyScrambler.exe" has not been modified or abused in a way that prevents it from triggering the rule, such as being renamed or obfuscated.

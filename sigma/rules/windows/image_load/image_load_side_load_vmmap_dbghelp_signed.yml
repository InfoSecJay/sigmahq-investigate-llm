  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets potential DLL sideloading of `dbghelp.dll` by the Sysinternals tool VMMap. DLL sideloading occurs when a legitimate signed DLL is loaded from an unexpected location, which can be exploited by attackers to bypass security measures and execute malicious code. The rule specifically monitors the loading of the `dbghelp.dll` from the path `C:\Debuggers\` by either the `vmmap.exe` or `vmmap64.exe` binaries, while confirming that the DLL is signed. When these conditions are met, it suggests a possible attempt at abuse of the legitimate tool for malicious purposes. This activity is closely associated with MITRE ATT&CK techniques related to defense evasion (T1574.001 and T1574.002) as well as persistence and privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to examine the process creation logs for `vmmap.exe` or `vmmap64.exe` execution to determine the context of use and the user credentials involved.
  - **Inspect Loaded DLLs:** Utilize Sysmon or EDR to check the `dbghelp.dll` loaded by the processes in question to verify its path, signature, and any anomalies in its behavior.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Use network logs from your NDR or Firewall to identify any suspicious outbound connections made by the processes in question during their execution which could indicate additional malicious activity.
  - **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence:** Consult threat intelligence resources to determine if there have been known exploits or active campaigns leveraging signed tools like VMMap for malicious purposes.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity because, while the detection indicates potentially malicious activity, further investigation is needed to ascertain if this use of `dbghelp.dll` is indeed malicious or if it is legitimate. The context of how these tools are used in your environment is critical to understanding the risk.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `dbghelp.dll` file is not loaded from the specified path, or if the execution context of `vmmap.exe` is legitimate, such as during routine debugging by an authorized user. It assumes that the security posture is such that tools are not commonly executed by users with elevated privileges. Furthermore, if an adversary alters the path from which `dbghelp.dll` is loaded or executes `vmmap` with an unauthorized DLL, this detection might fail to trigger.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the loading of specific scripting DLLs by the WMI script host process `scrcons.exe`, which can be indicative of malicious activities involving WMI ActiveScriptEventConsumers. The rule evaluates the process creation logs for the presence of `scrcons.exe`, followed by the loading of one or more DLLs commonly associated with scripting tasks, such as `vbscript.dll`, `wbemdisp.dll`, `wshom.ocx`, and `scrrun.dll`. By detecting this activity, the rule can help uncover possible lateral movement, privilege escalation, or persistence techniques exploited by adversariesâ€”especially aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1546.003 (Event Triggered Execution: WMI Event Subscription) and T1028 (Windows Management Instrumentation). Analysts should consider both the intent behind the invocation of these DLLs and the context in which `scrcons.exe` is running.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Tree:** Investigate the process tree to identify parent processes that initiated `scrcons.exe`. Understand the context of its execution and relationships to other processes.
  - **Review WMI Event Consumers:** Query the WMI repository to list all Event Consumers. Verify if there are any suspicious or unauthorized event consumers that could trigger malicious actions.
  - **Examine DLL Loads:** Analyze the loading of detected DLLs using Sysmon logs or EDR tools. Look for unusual load times or patterns that could indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Correlate with Security Logs:** Analyze Windows Security and Application event logs around the time of the trigger to assess any anomalies or associated security events that may indicate a broader compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential implications of WMI ActiveScriptEventConsumers facilitating lateral movement, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms. Immediate investigation is warranted to confirm whether the activity is legitimate or indicative of a security incident.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `scrcons.exe` runs without loading the specified DLLs or if an adversary uses alternative scripting methods or legitimate tools that do not trigger this particular detection. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate software behavior, such as software updates or authorized administrative actions involving scripting. Recognizing these perspectives aids detection engineers in refining the rule and understanding its limitations.

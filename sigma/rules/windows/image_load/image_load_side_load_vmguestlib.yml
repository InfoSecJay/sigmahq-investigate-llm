  ### Technical Context
  The "VMGuestLib DLL Sideload" rule detects the unauthorized loading of the `vmGuestLib.dll` file by the `WmiApSrv.exe` service, which is a component of VMware Tools used for managing virtual machines. This detection is critical in identifying potential DLL sideloading attacks, a technique leveraged by attackers for maintaining persistence and achieving privilege escalation on compromised systems. The rule inspects Windows image load events to check if the specified `vmGuestLib.dll` is loaded by the `WmiApSrv.exe` process, ensuring the image is not only present but is signed as legitimate. This is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of defense evasion (T1574.001) and persistence (T1574.002), as attackers may try to sideload DLLs to escape detection by loading malicious components as part of trusted processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Image Load Events**: Use Sysmon and EDR tools to filter for image load events involving `WmiApSrv.exe` and `vmGuestLib.dll`. Assess the signatures of these files to confirm their authenticity.
  - **Check System Logs**: Review Windows Security logs for any unusual process creation or service modifications around the time of the alert. Look for events that may indicate an elevation of privileges or anomalous behavior by the `WmiApSrv` service.
  - **Examine File Existence**: Confirm the presence of `vmGuestLib.dll` at the specified path on the affected system, and compare it against known good versions to rule out false positives due to legitimate installations.
  - **Network Activity Analysis**: Check for any unusual outbound connections or command execution linked to `WmiApSrv.exe` using EDR logs and NDR tools. This can help identify lateral movement attempts or coordination with external malicious infrastructure.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the medium severity of this alert, it should be treated as potentially serious due to the nature of DLL sideloading, which can serve as a precursor to deeper system compromise or initial foothold by attackers. Quick investigation is essential to determine the legitimacy of the activity and mitigate any potential threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `vmGuestLib.dll` is legitimately present and signed on the system prior to monitoring, leading to possible missed detections of unauthorized loads. Additionally, if an adversary employs techniques like renaming or modifying the legitimate DLL, it could evade detection. Assumptions made include that `WmiApSrv.exe` will consistently be utilized for DLL loading, which may not hold true for all environments or configurations.

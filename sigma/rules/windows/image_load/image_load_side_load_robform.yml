  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential DLL sideloading associated with "roboform.dll," which is utilized by RoboForm Password Manager. DLL sideloading is a technique where an attacker can execute malicious code by leveraging legitimate DLL files in a controlled application environment. The rule specifically looks for events in Windows where the `image_load` category indicates the loading of `roboform.dll` or its 64-bit variant, `roboform-x64.dll`, while ensuring that these DLLs are being loaded within the context of `robotaskbaricon.exe` or `robotaskbaricon-x64.exe`. It focuses on paths typically associated with the legitimate installation of RoboForm, but alerts if the DLL is loaded from these applications without being located in the expected installation directory. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1574.001 (DLL Search Order Hijacking) and T1574.002 (Sideloading).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Utilize the EDR tool to investigate any alerts associated with the `robotaskbaricon.exe` process to identify the origin of the `roboform.dll` and whether it was executed maliciously.
    
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Query Windows Process Creation events to trace the execution path of `robotaskbaricon.exe` and verify its execution and parent processes to determine potential malicious interactions.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Use the firewall or network detection tools to inspect network activity from the affected hosts around the time of the alert to identify any suspicious connections that may correlate with nefarious behavior.
  - **Examine System and Application Logs**: Review Windows Security and Application logs for any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies related to RoboForm components, especially those indicating privilege escalations or process modifications.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is deemed medium severity since DLL sideloading could lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access, posing a significant risk to organizational security. Quick investigation is essential to mitigate any potential exploitation by attackers.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the RoboForm application is installed in the standard directories typical for organizational deployments. If the application is run in a user-specific context (e.g., within the AppData directory), the detection may fail to trigger as intended since paths would differ from the expected ones. Additionally, if an adversary replaces or alters legitimate DLLs without employing recognized processes, this rule might also fail to detect such actions.

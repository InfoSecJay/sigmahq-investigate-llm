  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets the execution of the Thor Scanner, specifically checking for instances where either "thor.exe" or "thor64.exe" is loaded as an image or executed in the environment. The rule identifies execution attempts of these binary files that are not digitally signed or lack a valid Nextron Systems GmbH signature. To accomplish this, the monitoring focuses on Windows Sysmon logs, particularly the `image_load` category, which provides detailed information about executable images being loaded into system memory. When the specified binaries are executed without a valid signature, it raises a red flag as it could indicate a potential security threat, making it relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the specific technique of "T1574 
  - Hijack Execution Flow." The detection emphasizes identifying malicious use of tools that may otherwise appear normal at first glance.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Execution Logs:** Examine Windows Sysmon logs, specifically for events related to `image_load`, to identify instances where the Thor Scanner binaries were executed and verify their digital signatures.
  - **Review Process Tree:** Utilize your EDR solution to analyze the process tree and ascertain the parent process of “thor.exe” or “thor64.exe” instances to identify any suspicious activity or lateral movement.
  - **Cross-Reference with AV Logs:** Investigate any alerts or logs from antivirus systems to see if they flagged "thor.exe" or "thor64.exe" as a potential threat and determine the context of these alerts.
  - **Network Activity Analysis:** Inspect network connection logs for any unusual outbound connections initiated by the Thor Scanner binaries, as this may clarify if the execution was part of a larger malicious campaign.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert for this rule is classified with high severity because the execution of unsigned binaries can indicate potentially malicious behavior, particularly in environments where vigilance against unauthorized tools is critical. Rapid investigation is essential to prevent any possible exploitation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if “thor.exe” or “thor64.exe” are signed with a valid signature or if legitimate instances of these binaries signed by Nextron Systems GmbH are present, leading to potential false negatives. Adversaries may also use code-signing techniques to bypass detection, thereby leveraging signed versions of malicious tools. Additionally, reliance on standard signature checks may fail to capture variant names or alterations employed by attackers. Therefore, analysts must remain alert for legitimate binaries that could be misused within the organization.

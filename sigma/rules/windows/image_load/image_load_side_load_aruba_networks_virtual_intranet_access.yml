  ### Technical Context
  The "Aruba Network Service Potential DLL Sideloading" detection rule is designed to identify suspicious activity wherein the *arubanetsvc.exe* process may be exploited through DLL side-loading techniques. This rule focuses on processes that load specific DLL files which are commonly targeted by attackers for privilege escalation and persistence. The rule detects instances in which *arubanetsvc.exe* loads general-purpose DLLs such as *wtsapi32.dll*, *msvcr100.dll*, and several others typically located in system directories such as *C:\Windows\System32\*. 
  By monitoring the Image Load events in Sysmon, this rule aims to flag activities where legitimate processes may be hijacked to load malicious versions of these DLLs, a method often employed by attackers to facilitate unauthorized access or maintain a presence within an environment. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of privilege escalation (T1068) and persistence (T1574), specifically techniques T1574.001 and T1574.002, which involve using DLL sideloading as a method of evasion and establishment of footholds within a network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Behavior**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze the *arubanetsvc.exe* process for any unusual activity, such as unexpected process creation or network connections.
  - **Examine Loaded DLLs**: Check the list of loaded libraries in the incident timeline to identify any unauthorized DLLs that were loaded by *arubanetsvc.exe*.
  - **Correlate with Sysmon Logs**: Review Sysmon logs focusing on the image load events for the relevant process to establish if the behavior aligns with known good activity or indicates a potential compromise.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators**: Use endpoint data, network logs, and proxy logs to investigate for known malicious indicators that might relate to the loaded DLLs or network traffic behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because DLL sideloading can lead to critical security breaches, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the targeted service, potentially compromising sensitive data or system control.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the malicious DLLs are loaded from non-standard paths not monitored by Sysmon, or if the attacker employs obfuscation methods that mask the execution of the *arubanetsvc.exe* process. Additionally, if updates or modifications to the service or its environment occur without logging, detection may fail. There is also an assumption that Sysmon is configured accurately and that logs are retained sufficiently for retrospective analysis.

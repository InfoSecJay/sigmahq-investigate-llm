  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential DLL sideloading involving the unsigned `dbghelp.dll` file when loaded by the Sysinternals tool `VMMap`. DLL sideloading is a technique that adversaries can use to execute malicious code within legitimate processes, often exploiting the trust placed in signed executables and their associated libraries. This detection leverages image load events from Windows to identify instances where `vmmap.exe` or `vmmap64.exe` loads a specific `dbghelp.dll` file that is not properly signed. The rule looks for the loading of `C:\Debuggers\dbghelp.dll` while ensuring that the signature of the DLL is checked; if it is unsigned, an alert is triggered. Each event of interest feeds into identifying an anomaly, effectively assisting in recognizing potential misuse under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically tactics associated with *Defense Evasion*, *Persistence*, and *Privilege Escalation* (T1574.001, T1574.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Check EDR logs for the execution of `vmmap.exe` or `vmmap64.exe` around the time of the alert to confirm the activity's legitimacy and context.
  - **Analyze DLL Signatures**: Inspect the signatures of the loaded `dbghelp.dll` to determine whether it was signed properly or if it is indeed unsigned as flagged by the detection rule.
  - **Check Process Relationships**: Utilize process monitoring tools to examine how `vmmap.exe` interacted with other processes, identifying any parent-child relationships that may indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Investigate Network Activity**: Use network logs to determine if there were any unusual communications or data exfiltration attempts coinciding with the DLL loading event.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity, as the presence of an unsigned DLL in the execution context of a legitimate system utility potentially indicates an attacker's attempt to establish persistence or escalate privileges, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - **False Positives**: This rule may generate false positives if legitimate software updates or debugging processes involve loading `dbghelp.dll` in non-malicious ways. 
  - **Assumption of Execution Context**: The rule assumes that the environment typically employs `vmmap.exe` or `vmmap64.exe`; if these tools are uncommon within the organization, the detection may not be relevant. 
  - **EAffect of Signing Certificates**: If an adversary uses a legitimate, signed version of `dbghelp.dll`, the rule would fail to trigger an alert, potentially allowing malicious activity to go unnoticed.

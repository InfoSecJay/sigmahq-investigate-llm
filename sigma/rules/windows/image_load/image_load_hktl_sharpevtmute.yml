  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the loading of the `EvtMuteHook.dll`, which is a vital component of the SharpEvtHook tool. This tool is commonly used by adversaries to manipulate and obscure activity within the Windows event logs, thereby facilitating malicious behavior without detection. The rule specifically analyzes image load events in Windows systems, looking for a particular import hash signature (`IMPHASH=330768A4F172E10ACB6287B87289D83B`) to identify the presence of this DLL. By leveraging Windows Sysmon telemetry, the detection focuses on the image load category to ascertain when harmful DLLs are being injected or loaded into processes. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK defensive evasion tactic, specifically technique T1562.002, which involves tampering with logs to conceal malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Sysmon Logs:** Examine Sysmon image load logs for any entries related to `EvtMuteHook.dll` to confirm unauthorized loading of the DLL.
  - **Validate Process Context:** Utilize EDR to identify the parent process responsible for loading the DLL and evaluate its legitimacy and behavior.
  - **Check for Additional Artifacts:** Search for any accompanying indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as command-line parameters or additional loaded DLLs that may be present alongside `EvtMuteHook.dll`.
  - **Assess Event Log Tampering:** Review Windows event logs (Security, System, Application) for any gaps or anomalies that could suggest log manipulation as a result of the detected DLL loading.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been assigned a high severity level due to the potential impact associated with log tampering, which can significantly hinder detection efforts and allow malicious activities to persist undetected in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where the adversary uses a DLL with a different import hash or renames the DLL to evade detection. Additionally, if the DLL is loaded through legitimate processes or methods that are not captured by Sysmon, the rule will not trigger. Engineers should be aware that attackers may leverage tools or scripts that mimic the function of legitimate DLLs or modify their signatures to avoid detection, limiting the effectiveness of this specific rule.

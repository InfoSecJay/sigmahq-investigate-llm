  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies potential security threats by detecting the loading of System Control Panel items (.cpl files) from uncommon or non-standard locations on a Windows system. Normally, these files are expected to be loaded from directories such as `C:\Windows\System32\`, `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\`, or `C:\Windows\WinSxS\`. By monitoring the image load events, this rule highlights instances where these files, specifically `hdwwiz.cpl` and `appwiz.cpl`, are being accessed from atypical locations. Such behavior may indicate an attempt at sideloading malicious content that masquerades as legitimate system components, thus evading common detection measures. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1036), which focuses on techniques adversaries use to avoid detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Logs:** Examine EDR alerts related to image load events for the specified .cpl files and identify their source paths to confirm if they are coming from uncommon locations.
  - **Analyze Process Details:** Use the process creation logs to find the parent processes that loaded these .cpl files. Pay attention to any suspicious parent processes, as they may provide context regarding potential compromise.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Look at network traffic involving any processes that executed these .cpl files. This will help identify whether they communicated with any potentially malicious external entities.
  - **Investigate User Activity:** Review user activities around the time these .cpl files were loaded. Changes in user behavior, such as executing unusual applications, can indicate malicious intent or compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for malicious activity that could indicate an attempt to manipulate system controls or install malware. A timely investigation is crucial to prevent possible exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Potential blind spots may include legitimate applications that utilize .cpl files from uncommon locations, resulting in false positives. Additionally, if the adversary is skilled, they might load .cpl files from scripted or automated processes that do not trigger obvious alerts. There's also the possibility that new or unknown files could evade detection due to their non-standard naming conventions. Analysts should be aware that successful evasion techniques could render this rule ineffective against well-defended adversaries.

  Detects the load of RstrtMgr DLL (Restart Manager) by a suspicious process.
  This library has been used during ransomware campaigns to kill processes that would prevent file encryption by locking them (e.g. Conti ransomware, Cactus ransomware). It has also recently been seen used by the BiBi wiper for Windows.
  It could also be used for anti-analysis purposes by shut downing specific processes.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify instances where the `RstrtMgr.dll` (Restart Manager) is loaded by suspicious processes. This dynamic link library is known for its use in ransomware operations, as it can terminate critical processes that would otherwise obstruct file encryption activities, as seen in notorious ransomware such as Conti and Cactus. Additionally, the library has recently been exploited by the BiBi wiper, which aims to erase data from compromised systems. The rule monitors specific paths often associated with malicious activity and flags instances where the DLL is loaded, providing an early warning of potential ransomware or anti-analysis tactics being employed. 
  The technical data sources involved in this rule include Windows Sysmon logs specifically focused on *image load events*. By inspecting the `ImageLoaded` parameter for occurrences of `RstrtMgr.dll`, analysts can identify abnormal usage patterns indicative of malicious intent. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Impact (T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact) and Defense Evasion (T1562.001: Impair Defenses), as attackers leverage tools like this DLL to hinder security measures and preserve their operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Source:** Check the EDR for details on the suspicious process that loaded `RstrtMgr.dll`, including its parent process and any associated command-line arguments.
    
  - **Examine File Paths:** Investigate the paths from which the loading process originates, using Windows event logs to check if they match known malicious locations such as `C:\Users\Public\` or others specified in the rule.
    
  - **Review Associated Events:** Utilize Sysmon and other monitoring tools to analyze correlated events in proximity to the DLL load event, focusing on process creation, file modifications, and registry changes.
    
  - **Evaluate Network Connections:** Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound connections made by the suspicious process, as this could indicate data exfiltration or additional malicious payload downloads.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of the `RstrtMgr.dll` being used in conjunction with suspicious processes, which can indicate the presence of ransomware or other malicious activity intending to disrupt operations or manipulate the system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule will not trigger if the `RstrtMgr.dll` is loaded from trusted processes or legitimate software installation programs, leading to potential false negatives. Additionally, if the attacker uses advanced methods, such as process hollowing or other in-memory techniques to load their payload without directly invoking the DLL, this rule may not capture that activity. Analysts should remain aware of these limitations and consider leveraging additional behavioral indicators for a comprehensive detection approach.

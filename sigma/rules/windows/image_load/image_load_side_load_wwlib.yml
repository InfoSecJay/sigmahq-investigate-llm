  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for potential DLL sideloading of "wwlib.dll" is designed to identify instances where this particular dynamic link library (DLL) is loaded in an unintended manner, indicating a potential security risk. The rule looks for DLL loads that occur specifically when Microsoft Word (winword.exe) runs but not from the legitimate paths associated with the Microsoft Office installation directories. The primary focus here is to identify when "wwlib.dll" is loaded, potentially indicating that an attacker has exploited DLL search order hijacking to execute malicious code. 
  This rule leverages the Image Load event from Windows to capture image loading activities. By specifying conditions that check if the loaded image ends with "wwlib.dll" and ensuring that it is loaded outside of the sanctioned Microsoft Office directories, the rule effectively identifies suspicious behavior that aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1574) and Privilege Escalation (T1574.001, T1574.002). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check EDR logs for any processes associated with the image load event of "wwlib.dll" and their parent processes. Assess whether these processes originate from legitimate software installations.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs to trace back the execution path of winword.exe and any other related processes. Look for anomalies in command-line parameters or arguments that may reveal malicious intent.
  - **Inspect File Integrity and Context:** Examine the file properties and context of "wwlib.dll" to determine if it exists in unexpected directories or has been modified recently. Investigate its digital signature and source to confirm authenticity.
  - **Evaluate Network Connections:** Review network connections made by winword.exe during the detection timeframe to identify any suspicious external communications that may indicate data exfiltration or further malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for attackers to exploit DLL sideloading as a vector for maintaining persistence or escalation of privileges. While not all instances of "wwlib.dll" loading are malicious, the atypical circumstances warrant immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if "wwlib.dll" is being loaded from a legitimate path or if an adversary has implemented methods to evade detection, such as renaming the DLL or altering its file path to appear legitimate. Additionally, if the Office applications are not used frequently or if the targeted machines are misconfigured, the detection could fail to capture genuine threats. As such, engineers need to be aware of the limitations around monitoring DLLs that fall outside standard Office installation paths.

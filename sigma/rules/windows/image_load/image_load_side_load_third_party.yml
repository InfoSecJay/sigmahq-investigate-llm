  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying DLL sideloading techniques related to third-party software, specifically targeting applications like Lenovo Utilities and Toshiba Bluetooth software. DLL sideloading is a method whereby a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. The detection is rooted in monitoring image load events on Windows systems, particularly the instances where specific DLLs are loaded from known paths associated with these applications. The rule utilizes process creation logs and checks whether the loaded DLLs, such as `commfunc.dll` and `tosbtkbd.dll`, reside outside their expected locations (e.g., the proper program directories), indicating a potential sideloading attempt.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Utilize the EDR to review the process creation logs for any instances of the suspicious DLLs being loaded. Pay special attention to the file paths to identify deviations from expected application directories.
  - Cross-reference the affected endpoints with your inventory of installed third-party software to understand the context of the applicationâ€™s usage on the device.
  - Leverage your AV or endpoint security tools to scan for any known malicious signatures associated with the identified DLLs, especially those flagged as potential side-loading threats.
  - Examine cloud logs (if applicable) for unusual network traffic patterns or other suspicious activity that correlates with the time the DLL was loaded, as this may indicate an ongoing or past compromise.

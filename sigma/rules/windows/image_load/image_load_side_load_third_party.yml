  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect DLL sideloading, a technique used by adversaries to run malicious code by leveraging legitimate dynamic link libraries (DLLs) of well-known third-party applications, including Zoom and Toshiba utilities. The rule specifically looks for DLLs loaded into memory that do not originate from their expected installation directories. It examines Windows image load events from Sysmon logs, particularly focusing on entries where the loaded image file ends with specific DLL names associated with third-party software. The rule leverages the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1574.001 (DLL Sideloading) and T1574.002 (Sideloading), falling under the tactics of Defense Evasion, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Suspicious Processes**: Use EDR tools to investigate the running processes associated with the flagged DLLs to determine if any are executing unexpected or unauthorized actions.
  - **Review Sysmon Logs**: Query Sysmon logs for recent 'Image Loaded' events that match the detected DLLs and analyze the `ImageLoaded` paths for any anomalies outside typical directories.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Investigate any network activity originating from the identified processes using NDR and Proxy logs for unusual external communications that could indicate a breach.
  - **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence**: Utilize threat intelligence platforms to check if the observed behavior aligns with known indicators of compromise (IoCs) or previously reported malicious activity related to the flagged applications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium priority due to the potential risk of malware execution via trusted software components, which can compromise the integrity of systems and may lead to further exploitation if left unchecked.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if an adversary employs custom or less common DLL names not included in the detection logic. Additionally, if the DLLs are loaded from valid paths or if the sideloading occurs with elevated privileges, it might bypass detection. Assumptions are made that all third-party applications are properly installed in expected directories, which may not be universally true. Variation in deployment practices across the enterprise environment could result in false negatives.

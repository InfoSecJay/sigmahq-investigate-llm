  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Iviewers.DLL Sideloading" is designed to detect instances where the "iviewers.dll" file is loaded in an unexpected or suspicious manner. Specifically, it monitors for the loading of this DLL outside of the trusted directories associated with the Windows Kits, which are legitimate system paths. When this DLL is loaded from unusual locations, it may indicate a potential sideloading attack, as adversaries often use such techniques to execute malicious code under the guise of legitimate applications to evade detection.
  This rule utilizes Windows image load events to track when the specific DLL is loaded in the system. The detection focuses on those events where the 'ImageLoaded' entry ends with '\iviewers.dll' but does not occur within the safe confines of predefined paths, indicating a possible attempt to sideload malicious code. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1574) and Privilege Escalation (T1574.001, T1574.002), given that it may be employed by attackers to elevate their access privileges or bypass standard security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Logs:** Examine the Windows Security and Sysmon event logs around the time of the alert to identify any process creation events related to the image load. Look specifically for unusual parent-child relationships and unexpected command-line arguments.
    
  - **Analyze File Path:** Investigate the file path from which "iviewers.dll" was loaded. Cross-reference it with known safe directories to determine if it deviates from standard installations or corporate applications.
  - **Check Execution Context:** Utilize the EDR to review the execution context of the process that loaded the DLL. Pay close attention to any anomaly in user privileges or processes that were running when the DLL was loaded.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Review network logs for any outbound connections initiated by the process that loaded "iviewers.dll." Suspicious network behavior may indicate data exfiltration or communication with known malicious domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential ramifications of DLL sideloading, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges within the environment. Prompt investigation is critical to mitigate the risk of a larger compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the DLL is loaded from a trusted location, as indicated in the filter criteria, thereby potentially missing legitimate side-loading attempts. Additionally, if an adversary modifies their tactics to load the DLL through alternate methods or obfuscation techniques not covered by this rule, it may evade detection. Furthermore, the rule assumes that the Sysmon logging is properly configured and that no critical logging has been disabled, which could lead to gaps in visibility.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential appverifUI.DLL Sideloading" is designed to detect suspicious loading of the `appverifUI.dll` file, specifically when it is loaded by a process outside its legitimate context. This rule focuses on the loading of the DLL when it is associated with the execution of `appverif.exe`, a legitimate application typically found in `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\` and `C:\Windows\System32\`. The rule utilizes the Windows Image Load events to monitor when `appverifUI.dll` is being loaded by the legitimate application paths but uncovers scenarios where the DLL can be misused by adversariesâ€”signifying potential privilege escalation or bypassing of application controls. The corresponding MITRE ATT&CK tactics include "Defense Evasion" and "Privilege Escalation," specifically referencing techniques T1574.001 (DLL Search Order Hijacking) and T1574.002 (DLL Side-Loading).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Context**: Use EDR tools to examine the process context of `appverifUI.dll`. Confirm whether it is being loaded by a legitimate instance of `appverif.exe` or if there are indications of an illegitimate process attempting to load the DLL.
  - **Check Parent Process**: Investigate the parent process associated with the loading of `appverifUI.dll` in the process tree using Sysmon logs. Suspicious parent processes could signify potential attempts to sideload malicious DLLs.
  - **Review Additional Logs**: Look through Windows Event Logs, especially security and application logs, to identify any unusual activities correlated with `appverif.exe`. Cross-reference any related events with timestamps of the alert for a comprehensive view.
  - **Assess Impact on Systems**: Use network logs and threat intelligence platforms to trace any potential communications or connections established by the processes involved. This will help assess the wider impact and potential follow-up actions by the attacker.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the alert's high severity level, it indicates a potential active attack scenario where an adversary could be attempting to sideload a malicious DLL, thereby compromising system integrity and escalating privileges.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under scenarios where the sideloading occurs from unexpected sources that do not include `appverif.exe`, or if the loading of the DLL is from a detected legitimate process not covered by the rule. Additionally, if the threat actor employs obfuscation techniques or modifies the DLL loading paths to circumvent detection, the rule may fail to trigger. It's critical for detection engineers to remain vigilant regarding changes in legitimate application behaviors and the ongoing evolution of sideloading techniques that might render the detection ineffective.

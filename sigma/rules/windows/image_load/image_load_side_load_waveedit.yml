  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Waveedit.DLL Sideloading" is designed to detect potential DLL sideloading attacks involving the "waveedit.dll" file, which is associated with the Nero WaveEditor software. DLL sideloading occurs when an attacker places a malicious DLL in a location expected by a legitimate executable, leading the executable to load and execute the malicious DLL instead. This particular rule monitors for instances of the DLL being loaded from paths that are not the legitimate directories of the software. The critical technical data sources involved are image load events captured by Windows Sysmon, particularly focusing on the `ImageLoaded` field to track the loading of the waveedit.dll library. The rule ties into the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of Defense Evasion and Privilege Escalation, specifically techniques T1574.001 (DLL Side-Loading) and T1574.002 (DLL Search Order Hijacking). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Use EDR tools to investigate the process loading waveedit.dll. Confirm whether the associated application is running from the expected path of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Nero\Nero Apps\Nero WaveEditor\waveedit.exe`.
  - **Examine Related Activity:** Check the process creation logs around the time of the alert to identify any unusual command-line arguments or parent processes that may indicate suspicious behavior.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Utilize network detection tools to review any outbound connections made by the process. Look for patterns that match known indicators of compromise or command-and-control activity.
  - **Inspect File System Changes:** Review file system activity logs for any changes or new files created in directories related to the Nero WaveEditor, which could suggest tampering or malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential risk associated with DLL sideloading attacks, which can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized execution of malicious code within the target environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if waveedit.dll is loaded from a legitimate, yet manipulated, directory. It also assumes that Sysmon is configured to log image load events adequately; if Sysmon is not installed or misconfigured, the rule will fail to detect such activities. Additionally, the detection logic does not account for variations in file naming, transformations, or uncommon execution paths that an adversary might employ to evade detection.

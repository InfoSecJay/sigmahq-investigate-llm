  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Unsigned Mfdetours.DLL Sideloading" is designed to detect the potentially malicious loading of an unsigned Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file called "mfdetours.dll" on Windows systems. This DLL is associated with a legitimate tool, "mftrace.exe," that can be exploited by attackers to attach it to arbitrary processes, enabling them to load malicious or unauthorized DLLs from the current execution directory. The detection mechanism focuses on the `ImageLoaded` event, which is captured from Windows Sysmon logs. Specifically, it looks for any instances of "mfdetours.dll" being loaded while filtering out instances where it is loaded from a legitimate path (i.e., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\`) or possesses a valid digital signature. This rule is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques of defense evasion (T1574.001) and privilege escalation (T1574.002), highlighting the threats posed by unauthorized DLL loading that can be used to bypass security mechanisms.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs:** Investigate Sysmon logs for instances of "mfdetours.dll" loading by querying the `ImageLoaded` events to identify any unexpected or unauthorized loading paths.
  - **Validate Executables:** Review the execution history of "mftrace.exe" using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to assess whether it was executed from a suspicious or unauthorized directory.
  - **Analyze Process Relationships:** Utilize EDR or Process Explorer to investigate the parent-child relationships of processes associated with "mftrace.exe" to identify any potentially malicious parent processes.
  - **Review Security Events:** Cross-reference Windows Event Security logs for user account logins and permissions that coincide with the execution timestamp of "mftrace.exe" to check for unauthorized changes or privilege escalations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for side-loading unsigned DLLs, which may lead to significant security breaches or privilege escalations within an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if the loading of "mfdetours.dll" occurs from a legitimate directory that is not specified in the filter criteria, or if the DLL has a valid signature. Additionally, if adversaries have access to modify the legitimate paths or deploy a signed version of the DLL, the detection may be bypassed. Engineers should be aware that noise in the environment, such as legitimate software updates or system maintenance tasks, could result in false negatives or positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting potential DLL sideloading of "RjvPlatform.dll" targets the process "SystemResetPlatform.exe" when it loads the DLL from a non-standard directory. The rule specifically monitors image load events on Windows systems, identifying instances where the specified DLL is loaded during the execution of the executable. The key technical data sources involved in this detection are process creation logs and image load logs, collected through Windows Sysmon. The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1574) and Privilege Escalation (T1574.001, T1574.002), which involve evading detection mechanisms by manipulating legitimate software and executing code from unexpected locations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the creation of `SystemResetPlatform.exe` through EDR solutions to ascertain its origin and verify whether it has been launched from a legitimate context or not.
  - **Check Image Load Events:** Utilize Sysmon logs to examine recent image load events for `RjvPlatform.dll`, confirming whether it has been loaded from the expected or an unusual directory.
  - **Inspect File Attributes:** Analyze the file properties of both `RjvPlatform.dll` and `SystemResetPlatform.exe`, particularly focusing on the file paths, signatures, and timestamps to determine their legitimacy.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Look into network connection logs for behavioral anomalies that may indicate external command and control (C2) activities associated with the suspicious process.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for privilege escalation and evasion tactics that can compromise system integrity and security. Immediate investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the file execution and associated network behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized issue is that legitimate applications may occasionally load DLLs from non-default directories without malicious intent, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if sufficient logging is not enabled on the endpoint or if the file is pre-existently whitelisted, the rule may not fire. Adversaries may also utilize various techniques to hide their actions, such as using different process names or obfuscating file paths to evade detection.

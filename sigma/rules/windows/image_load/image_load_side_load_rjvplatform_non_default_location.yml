  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential DLL sideloading of `RjvPlatform.dll` by `SystemResetPlatform.exe` when this process loads the DLL from a non-default location. Typically, legitimate DLLs, such as `RjvPlatform.dll`, should reside in their standard directories, which helps in preventing malicious exploitation. This rule monitors `image_load` logs, specifically looking for instances where `RjvPlatform.dll` is loaded by `SystemResetPlatform.exe`, while ensuring the process source isnâ€™t from its legitimate path (typically `C:\Windows\System32\SystemResetPlatform\`). If it detects a load from any other location, it flags it as a potentially malicious action indicative of an attack technique used for defense evasion and privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Examine the EDR logs for details on the process `SystemResetPlatform.exe`, focusing on its execution context, parent processes, and any unusual command-line parameters.
  - Review application logs in the cloud or on-premises that might reference the `RjvPlatform.dll` loading activity to determine if there are any correlated events with known malicious activity.
  - Utilize the SIEM to query for any alerts or anomalies related to DLL loading events around the same time frame as the detected instance to identify potential lateral movement.
  - Cross-check the integrity and digital signature of `RjvPlatform.dll` to determine its legitimacy and investigate its path to confirm if the behavior is indeed unexpected.

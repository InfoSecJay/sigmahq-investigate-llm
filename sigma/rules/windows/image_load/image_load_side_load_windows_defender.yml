  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potential Mpclient.DLL Sideloading" is designed to identify suspicious activity involving the loading of the "mpclient.dll" library by Windows Defender processes, specifically "MpCmdRun.exe" and "NisSrv.exe". The objective is to catch potential sideloading attacks where adversaries exploit legitimate Windows Defender executables to load malicious libraries from non-standard directory locations. The primary technical data sources for this rule are Windows Event Logs focusing on image load events, which record when DLLs and other executable images are loaded into memory. The rule specifically looks for instances where "mpclient.dll" is loaded by these processes, but only if loaded from locations outside of known secure directories, which are outlined in the filter conditions. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1574.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the endpoint detection and response (EDR) system for alerts related to "MpCmdRun.exe" and "NisSrv.exe" and their associated process activity at the time of the alert.
    
  - **Gather Process Information:** Use Sysmon and Windows Security logs to track the historical process creation events surrounding the loading of "mpclient.dll" to identify any anomalous parent-child relationships.
    
  - **Check File Locations:** Investigate the file path used when "mpclient.dll" was loaded. Determine if it came from a known safe directory to evaluate whether potential sideloading occurred.
    
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Look into network connection logs from the EDR and NGFW during the timeframe of the incident to identify any unusual outbound traffic related to "MpCmdRun.exe" and "NisSrv.exe," which may indicate command and control communications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified with a "high" severity level due to the implications of defending against sideloading techniques, which can allow attackers to leverage trusted processes for malicious purposes. Such activities often indicate a significant risk of compromise to organizational assets and data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot is that the detection relies on the presence of applicable Windows Event Logs, particularly those that may not be configured or retained adequately in some environments. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries may employ techniques to mask their activities or utilize legitimate processes in ways that evade detection. It's also possible that environment-specific configurations or custom installations of Windows Defender may lead to false negatives if the paths differ from the defined known secure locations.

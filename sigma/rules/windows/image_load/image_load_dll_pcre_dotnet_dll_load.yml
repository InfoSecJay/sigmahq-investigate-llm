  ### Technical Context
  The PCRE.NET Package Image Load detection rule monitors for instances where processes load specific modules associated with the PCRE.NET package from a temporary directory. This is particularly relevant in Windows environments where the placement of executable images in user profile temporary directories can indicate potentially malicious behavior. The underlying detection leverages image load events captured by Sysmon, specifically looking for the path `\AppData\Local\Temp\ba9ea7344a4a5f591d6e5dc32a13494b\`, which is commonly used by attackers to store transient files that are executed in the user's context. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of execution, specifically identifying the technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), highlighting the potential for script-based attacks or command execution by malicious actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Check the process that loaded the PCRE.NET module using EDR tools to identify its parent process and verify whether it is a legitimate process or exhibits suspicious behavior. 
  - **Check Network Activity:** Review network connection logs to determine if the process attempted to communicate with any external or known malicious IP addresses relevant to the identified process. 
  - **Inspect Image and Command Line Parameters:** Use Sysmon logs to check the image path and inspect any command line parameters passed to the process for indicators of obfuscation or suspicious flags. 
  - **Review Temp Folder Contents:** Examine the contents of the `\AppData\Local\Temp\` folder for other potentially harmful files that may have been created or modified around the same time as the detected event, providing additional context for investigation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a high severity level due to the use of a temporary folder to load potentially malicious modules, which can indicate attempts at executing unwanted scripts or payloads within the environment. Immediate investigation is warranted to mitigate the risk of further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the PCRE.NET module is loaded from a different path or if the image loading occurs too quickly for the logging to capture. Additionally, if the adversary utilizes process hollowing or other evasion techniques, the rule may be bypassed entirely. It's important to recognize that valid application behavior could also generate false positives, particularly if legitimate use of similar naming conventions or paths occurs.

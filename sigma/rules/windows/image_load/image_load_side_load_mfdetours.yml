description: Detects potential DLL sideloading of "mfdetours.dll". While using "mftrace.exe"
  it can be abused to attach to an arbitrary process and force load any DLL named
  "mfdetours.dll" from the current directory of execution.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Mfdetours.DLL Sideloading" focuses on detecting potential side-loading of the "mfdetours.dll" dynamic link library (DLL) through the use of the "mftrace.exe" process. Side-loading is a technique that attackers exploit to load malicious DLLs into a running process, often bypassing security mechanisms. This specific rule looks for instances where the "mfdetours.dll" is loaded from an unexpected directory, particularly when the loading occurs outside of the legitimate path—specifically any path other than what is defined in 'filter_main_legit_path', which typically includes well-known directories like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\". The primary data sources for this rule involve image load events captured by Sysmon, specifically focusing on the ImageLoaded field to recognize when this DLL is invoked. 
  This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics "Defense Evasion" and "Privilege Escalation," corresponding to techniques T1574.001 (DLL Side-Loading) and T1574.002 (Trusted Relationship). By monitoring these events, security analysts can pinpoint potential malicious activity and investigate further to determine the impact on the environment or the possibility of a compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs**: Review Sysmon logs for any ImageLoaded events that include "mfdetours.dll" and verify the source path of the DLL to assess whether it originated from a legitimate directory.
  - **Validate Process Behavior**: Investigate the process behavior associated with "mftrace.exe" at the time of the event. Use EDR tools to monitor any unusual activity or command-line parameters that suggest an unauthorized use of the tool.
  - **Examine Parent Processes**: Analyze the parent-child relationship of processes involved in loading "mfdetours.dll" to ascertain if any suspicious or unknown parent processes initiated "mftrace.exe."
  - **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Perform a broader threat hunt using network and endpoint telemetry to identify any other indicators of compromise (IOCs) and correlate findings with known threat patterns or actor behaviors involving Sideloading techniques.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as medium, indicating that while the rule may indicate a suspicious activity, further analysis is necessary to determine the actual threat level. In an enterprise environment, detection of potential DLL side-loading should prioritize timely responses due to the possibility of privilege escalation and compromise of trusted processes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One blind spot in this detection could arise from legitimate applications that also utilize "mfdetours.dll" in expected ways, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an adversary has the means to manipulate the process or disguise their activities, this rule may fail to trigger an alert. The rule assumes that the “mfdetours.dll” will not be executed from legitimate paths; however, attackers may find ways to mimic legitimate behavior to evade detection.

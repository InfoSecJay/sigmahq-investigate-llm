title: Clfs.SYS Loaded By Process Located In a Potential Suspicious Location
id: fb4e2211-6d08-426b-8e6f-0d4a161e3b1d
status: experimental
description: Detects Clfs.sys being loaded by a process running from a potentially
  suspicious location. Clfs.sys is loaded as part of many CVEs exploits that targets
  Common Log File.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances of the 'Clfs.sys' driver being loaded by processes located in non-standard or potentially suspicious directories. Clfs.sys, or Common Log File System driver, is a component often exploited in various Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and is indicative of potential malicious activity, particularly in the context of file manipulation and unauthorized data access. The rule relies on Windows Event Logs, specifically focusing on image load events that capture information about DLLs being loaded into processes.
  To function effectively, this rule examines the paths from which 'Clfs.sys' is being loaded. By targeting processes executing from directories such as 'C:\Perflogs\', 'C:\Users\Public\', and other user-specific folders, the rule aims to highlight behaviors that stray from typical system operations. These paths are often associated with user-level activities and could signify attempts by attackers to hide malicious payloads among legitimate user files. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques for Execution (T1059), which encompasses running malicious scripts, executables, or processes, ultimately helping to identify and mitigate threats in enterprise environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Image Load Events:** Investigate EDR logs for any image load events that correspond to 'Clfs.sys' being loaded. Prioritize events that show processes running from the suspicious paths identified in the rule.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Utilize Windows Security and Sysmon process creation logs to trace the parent process of the detected event. Look for unusual parent-child process relationships that could indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Check for Associated Network Activity:** Examine network connection logs in your NDR system to see if the suspicious process attempts to establish outbound connections. This may indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server.
  - **Correlate with User Activity Logs:** Investigate any user activity logs, such as VPN access, to contextualize the usage of the suspicious file path. Check if the user account associated with the suspicious process has a history of anomalous behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with the loading of 'Clfs.sys' from suspicious directories, which could indicate exploitation attempts or malicious payload activity, necessitating further investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate applications load 'Clfs.sys' from the specified paths, leading to false negatives. Additionally, if adversaries utilize techniques such as code signing or launching processes from legitimate system locations, they might evade detection. It is assumed that listed paths will be monitored consistently, and users will not have an excessive amount of legitimate processes in the specified directories, which may skew the alerting mechanism.

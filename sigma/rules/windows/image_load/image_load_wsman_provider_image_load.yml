  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious WSMAN Provider Image Loads" rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity involving the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service, specifically through the Windows Management Instrumentation (WSMAN) provider. The rule focuses on the loading of specific DLL files associated with WSMAN, such as `WsmSvc.dll`, `WsmAuto.dll`, and `Microsoft.WSMan.Management.ni.dll`, by certain processes that are either unfamiliar or not commonly associated with legitimate WSMAN operations. By correlating events such as image loads from the command line and matching them against known benign processes, this rule highlights potential misuse of remote management capabilities, which could indicate lateral movement or malicious remote execution within the environment. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (T1059.001) and Lateral Movement (T1021.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Review the Windows Event Logs or EDR for the creation of processes that loaded the suspicious WSMAN DLLs and cross-reference against known legitimate application executions.
  - **Evaluate Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line parameters of related processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`) to identify any unusual or anomalous execution patterns that may suggest malicious intent.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Utilize the NDR and firewall logs to check for any unusual outbound network activity originating from the affected hosts that might indicate attempted lateral movement or communication with a command and control server.
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Investigate alerts triggered by the EDR regarding the identified processes, focusing on any alerts related to process tampering or suspicious behavior, and correlate them with the detected image loads.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as a medium severity because while the detection of suspicious WSMAN provider image loads does indicate potential malicious behavior, further investigation is required to confirm intent and target, as benign use can also trigger the rule.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where WSMAN activities occur legitimately without any associated anomalies, such as standard administrative tasks. Furthermore, if an adversary utilizes trusted executables or processes to load the WSMAN DLLs, such activities may evade detection. The reliance on specific DLLs means that changes or updates in the environment could lead to missed detections, or if an attacker employs different named processes or methods to execute lateral movement, the rule would not trigger.

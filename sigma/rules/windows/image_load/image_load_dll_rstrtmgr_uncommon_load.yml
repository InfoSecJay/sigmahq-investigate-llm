  Detects the load of RstrtMgr DLL (Restart Manager) by an uncommon process.
  This library has been used during ransomware campaigns to kill processes that would prevent file encryption by locking them (e.g. Conti ransomware, Cactus ransomware). It has also recently been seen used by the BiBi wiper for Windows.
  It could also be used for anti-analysis purposes by shut downing specific processes.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect when the RstrtMgr.dll (Restart Manager) is loaded by an uncommon or suspicious process. The Restart Manager is a Windows service that allows applications to be restarted without any loss of user data. However, its functionality has drawn interest from malicious actors, particularly in ransomware campaigns. For example, ransomware like Conti and Cactus has exploited this DLL to terminate crucial processes that may hinder file encryption. Additionally, the BiBi wiper has been known to use this DLL for destructive purposes, which makes it essential for a security operations center (SOC) to monitor its usage closely.
  The detection criteria focus on specific telemetry from Windows Sysmon, particularly the `image_load` category, which looks for instances where RstrtMgr.dll is loaded. The rule specifies conditions that filter out benign sources, allowing detection of only uncommon processes invoking the DLL. This helps analysts and incident responders identify potential misuse in accordance with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under tactics such as "Impact" (T1486) and "Defense Evasion" (T1562.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate the Process Source:** Use EDR tools to analyze the initiating process that loaded RstrtMgr.dll. Pay particular attention to the execution path and any suspicious behavior.
  - **Review Recent Activity:** Check the Windows Event Logs for the process creation (event ID 4688) surrounding the time of the RstrtMgr.dll load. This may provide context on what other processes were active.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Utilize EDR capabilities to monitor the behavior of the process in question. Look for any actions like process termination or unusual network connections that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Consult Threat Intelligence:** Refer to any known threat intelligence regarding the use of RstrtMgr.dll in ransomware campaigns. Use cloud logs and additional sources to cross-verify any suspicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized with a low severity level but should not be dismissed, as it may indicate preparation for a larger attack, particularly involving ransomware or other malicious tactics aimed at process manipulation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  A potential blind spot for this rule is legitimate processes as false positives that may load RstrtMgr.dll, such as installer applications or maintenance tasks. Analysts should consider the context of the environment since certain custom or internal software may also invoke this DLL legitimately. Additionally, this rule may not fire if the malicious actor uses sophisticated evasion techniques, such as loading the DLL in a context that is not monitored or through code injection methods that don't utilize standard process creation pathways.

  Detects the load of RstrtMgr DLL (Restart Manager) by an uncommon process.
  This library has been used during ransomware campaigns to kill processes that would prevent file encryption by locking them (e.g. Conti ransomware, Cactus ransomware). It has also recently been seen used by the BiBi wiper for Windows.
  It could also be used for anti-analysis purposes by shut downing specific processes.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the loading of the RstrtMgr.dll (Restart Manager) by unusual processes on Windows systems. Historically, this DLL has been exploited by ransomware variants, such as Conti and Cactus, to terminate applications that would hinder file encryption. Additionally, it has been associated with the BiBi wiper, which aims to delete user data during cyber incidents by terminating important processes. The rule leverages image load logs to monitor when RstrtMgr.dll is called by processes that do not commonly initiate this library, filtering out processes from known system directories and typical software installation paths. This helps in identifying potentially malicious activities, particularly attempts at process termination for nefarious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in your EDR tool to identify the parent and child processes involved during the DLL load to gain context on the execution chain.
  - Correlate the time of the alert with any recent alerts for unusual file activity or unauthorized access using the SIEM to spot further signs of compromise.
  - Analyze network traffic through NDR or proxy logs to check for any suspicious outbound connections made by the process which could indicate data exfiltration or command and control activity.
  - If applicable, check cloud logs for any related operations that may have leveraged the Restart Manager for initiating file deletions or shutdowns, particularly in environments utilizing cloud-based applications.

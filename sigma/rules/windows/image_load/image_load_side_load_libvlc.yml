  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potential Libvlc.DLL Sideloading" focuses on identifying potentially malicious manipulation involving the `libvlc.dll`, a dynamic link library utilized by the VLC media player. This rule targets instances where the `libvlc.dll` is loaded from non-standard directories rather than its legitimate installation paths, specifically those within `C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\` or `C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\`. By monitoring Windows image load events, the rule detects if the DLL is loaded from unexpected locations, signaling possible DLL sideloading, which adversaries often use as a technique for persistence or privilege escalation according to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1574.001 and T1574.002.
  This approach leverages Windows event logs related to image loading, allowing detection of attempts to load `libvlc.dll` that violates expected behavior. The rule aims to act as an early warning system against potential threats while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of the legitimate paths where VLC is traditionally installed. An entry detected by this rule should prompt a closer inspection to determine whether the source of the DLL is genuine or an indicator of adversarial activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Image Load Events:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to analyze the image load events associated with `libvlc.dll` and verify the loading path to ensure it aligns with the legitimate VLC installation directories.
  - **Correlate Process Creation Logs:** Check related process creation logs for any suspicious executables that might have initiated the DLL load, especially within unexpected paths.
  - **Inspect Non-Standard VLC Installations:** Investigate any systems with VLC installed outside the typical directories. Determine if these installations were intentional or indicative of malign activity.
  - **Analyze Network Activities:** Utilize EDR solutions to inspect any network connections made by the process loading the DLL to identify potential command-and-control communication or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is medium, as the detection of this potential sideloading attempt indicates possible adversarial activity that could lead to further exploitation or persistence on the system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in environments where VLC is installed in custom directories that are not monitored or if legitimate applications interact with `libvlc.dll` without triggering any suspicious behavior. Additionally, if an adversary has knowledge of the typical load paths and chooses to manipulate the DLL loading outside of these directories in controlled ways, this rule may not detect such actions. This emphasizes the necessity for robust monitoring practices beyond isolated detection rules.

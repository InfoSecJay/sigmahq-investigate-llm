  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious activity involving the `rundll32.exe` process loading a renamed version of the `comsvcs.dll`. By monitoring for this behavior, the rule aims to detect potential credential theft or defense evasion tactics employed by attackers. The rule utilizes Windows event logs, particularly those related to image loading events, which document instances when a process loads a dynamic link library (DLL). The focus is specifically on `rundll32.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility that can be exploited by attackers to execute DLL files with arbitrary code. The identified MITRE ATT&CK techniques include **T1003.001: Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory**, likely indicating an attempt to dump credentials from active sessions. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify `rundll32.exe` execution context**: Use EDR tools to examine the context under which `rundll32.exe` was executed, noting the parent process and any command-line arguments supplied, to understand potential malicious intent.
  - **Analyze loaded DLLs**: Investigate further by using Sysmon logs to check the full list of DLLs that were loaded during the execution of `rundll32.exe`, particularly focusing on any renamed or unauthorized versions of `comsvcs.dll`.
  - **Check for suspicious process behavior**: Utilize process monitoring tools to determine if `rundll32.exe` exhibited any atypical behavior, like high CPU usage or abnormal network connections, which could indicate further malicious activity.
  - **Review user activity**: Examine Windows Security logs to correlate user logins and sessions that occurred around the reported time of the alert, looking for anomalies that may suggest compromised credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for significant asset compromise associated with credential dumping, which could lead to further attacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Prompt investigation is warranted to mitigate the risk of lateral movement within the environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where the hash of the renamed `comsvcs.dll` is altered or unrecognized, as the detection relies heavily on identified hashes. Additionally, if the `rundll32.exe` process is executed under legitimate circumstances, such as through normal system updates or benign administrative scripts, false negatives may occur. The detection could also be bypassed if an attacker employs obfuscation techniques or uses alternative methods to load malicious code, such as direct API calls, circumventing the need for `rundll32.exe`.

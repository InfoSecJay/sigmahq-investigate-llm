  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious DLL sideloading from suspicious locations on Windows systems. Sideloading occurs when a legitimate DLL file is loaded from an untrusted or unauthorized directory, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code by an attacker. The rule looks specifically for the loading of known-abusive DLLs, such as `coreclr.dll` and `libcef.dll`, and matches them against paths commonly abused for this purpose, including user directories (e.g., `\Users\Public\`, `\Users\Favorites\`, `\Windows\Temp\`, etc.). This approach aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Execution (specifically technique T1059â€”Command and Scripting Interpreter), making it crucial to monitor these events to catch potential exploitation attempts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the Source of the DLL:** Use EDR tools to examine the path from which the suspicious DLL was loaded and verify if it is a legitimate operating location.
    
  - **Analyze the Process Tree:** Investigate the parent and child processes associated with the DLL loading event to understand the context and behavior of how the DLL was invoked.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Examine logs from Windows Security to determine if there were any suspicious user activities preceding the DLL loading event, such as unusual logins or unfamiliar actions.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Analyze network connection logs for any outbound connections initiated by the process that loaded the DLL to discover if it attempted to exfiltrate data or communicate with known malicious domains.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized DLL loading, which can lead to system compromise and data breaches. Immediate attention is recommended to assess the situation and prevent possible exploitation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate applications use the detected DLLs for standard operations, possibly leading to false positives. Additionally, it operates under the assumption that side-loaded DLLs are loaded from paths that match the query; however, sophisticated adversaries could utilize different paths or obfuscation techniques to evade detection. Furthermore, environments without adequate logging practices or older systems that do not monitor DLL loading adequately may fail to trigger this alert.

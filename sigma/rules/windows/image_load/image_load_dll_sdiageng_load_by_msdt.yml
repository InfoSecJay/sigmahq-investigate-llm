  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Diagnostic Library Sdiageng.DLL Loaded By Msdt.EXE" is designed to identify potential exploitation attempts of the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (msdt.exe) related to two critical vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-30190 (also known as the "Follina" vulnerability) and the DogWalk vulnerability. This rule specifically looks for instances where `msdt.exe` loads the `sdiageng.dll` library, indicating a potential malicious exploitation. The primary data source utilized for this rule is the image load logs, specifically focusing on the loading of processes and DLLs on Windows systems. By monitoring when `msdt.exe` is executed and subsequently loads `sdiageng.dll`, the rule can identify unauthorized or suspicious activities that could lead to system compromise. This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's tactic for defense evasion under the technique ID T1202, which relates to command and control methods employed by adversaries.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs for the execution of `msdt.exe` to determine the context and source of the initiation, paying special attention to abnormal user accounts or unusual script behavior.
    
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Examine alerts from the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions for any related behaviors following the detection, such as the creation of new processes, file modifications, or suspicious network activity.
  - **Review DNS Queries:** Investigate any DNS queries associated with the system at the time of the alert, as this may provide insights into potential command-and-control servers or other related artifacts.
  - **Examine Associated Network Connections:** Look into the network connection logs for any outbound connections made just before or after the alert, which may indicate data exfiltration attempts or communication with malicious entities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the critical nature of the vulnerabilities it seeks to detect. Successful exploitation of `msdt.exe` could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control over the affected system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that `msdt.exe` is being utilized in a standard manner, where previous behavior is well-documented within the environment. If the binary is commonly used for legitimate tasks without sufficient user education or controls, there may be elevated false positives. Additionally, if an adversary uses alternative methods or tools to exploit these vulnerabilities, such as directly invoking the DLL via other processes or utilizing a non-standard path, this rule may not fire. Understanding the environment's usage patterns of `msdt.exe` and `sdiageng.dll` is critical for tuning this detection and preventing evasion tactics.

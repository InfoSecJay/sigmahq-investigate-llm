  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets potential DLL hijacking within the DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) of the Internet Explorer application, specifically looking for the loading of the "iertutil.dll" file, which is that applicationâ€™s utility library. The rule identifies instances where the Internet Explorer process (`iexplore.exe`) loads a potentially malicious version of its DLL that may have been placed in a user or application directory rather than its intended system directory. The main data sources utilized for this rule include Windows Sysmon logs related to image loading events, which track the processes and DLLs being executed within the Windows environment.
  When the `ierutil.dll` is loaded by `iexplore.exe`, Sysmon captures this event, allowing analysts to investigate whether this loading was legitimate or part of a more nefarious action, like a lateral movement or exploitation attempt. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of "Lateral Movement" and the techniques `T1021.002` and `T1021.003`, which focus on exploitation methods that allow attackers to move across system boundaries and escalate privileges.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Sysmon Logs:** Begin by examining the Sysmon image load logs for instances where `iexplore.exe` has loaded `iertutil.dll`. Check the file path to confirm whether it is a legitimate system path or a possible indicator of compromise. 
  - **Check Process Creation Events:** Look at the process creation logs to determine if there are unusual or suspicious command-line arguments or parent processes associated with the `iexplore.exe` execution that could suggest an attack vector.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Use EDR tools to trace any unusual outbound network connections initiated by the `iexplore.exe` process while it was running. This could reveal communication with external malicious servers.
  - **Inspect File Integrity:** Validate the integrity of the `iertutil.dll` and related system files using your AV or endpoint security solution to ensure they have not been modified or replaced with malicious variants.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as critical severity due to the potential for DLL hijacking to allow an attacker upward system access or lateral movement within the network, making it a priority for immediate investigation to prevent further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where the malicious DLL is not named `iertutil.dll` or is located in a non-standard directory that does not end with the monitored path. Additionally, it assumes that Sysmon is properly configured and logging the appropriate events. Adversaries could defeat detection by utilizing obfuscation techniques, employing legitimate software behaviors, or targeting non-Windows systems or applications that do not use this mechanism.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential DLL hijacking attacks involving the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service. Specifically, it looks for the execution of `wmiprvse.exe`, a legitimate WMI process, that has loaded a malicious DLL named `wbemcomn.dll` from the `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\` directory. By creating this file and loading it, an attacker can manipulate WMI operations to execute arbitrary code, leading to potential system compromise. The primary data source for this detection is Windows Sysmon event logs, particularly focusing on image load events which capture process behavior and interactions. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation) and can also be connected to lateral movement tactics under T1021.002.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:** Investigate the logs of the execution path for `wmiprvse.exe` and confirm if it was started by an unexpected or unauthorized service.
  - **Analyze DLL Load Events:** Review Sysmon logs for any occurrences of `wbemcomn.dll` being loaded into `wmiprvse.exe` and validate the file's hash against known good signatures.
  - **Review Initial Access:** Utilize EDR solutions to determine how the file `wbemcomn.dll` was created within the `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\` directory and assess any network traffic related to its transfer.
  - **Check for Signs of Lateral Movement:** Correlate findings with user activity and other system logs for unusual WMI queries or interactions with remote systems that may indicate compromised accounts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the critical nature of WMI in system administration and its exploitation by attackers for lateral movement, potentially leading to elevated privileges and broader network compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `wbemcomn.dll` file is created and loaded using an alternative method that does not pass through the Sysmon monitoring layer. Additionally, if an attacker renames the malicious DLL or modifies it to evade detection heuristics, it may also go unnoticed. The assumption that `wmiprvse.exe` is always triggered from a legitimate process might be flawed, as attackers can use legitimate contexts to mask their activity.

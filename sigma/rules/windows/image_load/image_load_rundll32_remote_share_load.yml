  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect malicious activity associated with the use of `rundll32.exe` to load Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files from remote locations. The rule specifically looks for instances where `rundll32.exe` is used as a process that loads DLLs externally, indicated by the absence of a local file path (i.e., the path starts with `\\` signaling a remote call). This behavior is of particular concern, as it can signal an attempt by attackers to execute code on a target system by leveraging legitimate but potentially harmful tools. The detection leverages Windows Sysmon's `image_load` telemetry, particularly focusing on process creation logs that capture executable starts and the subsequent DLLs they load. This rule relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Execution tactic (T1204.002), which deals with the exploitation of user-initiated processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review any EDR alerts triggered around the same time as the identified event, focusing on the execution of `rundll32.exe` to confirm if the execution was legitimate or unauthorized.
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Investigate the process tree in the EDR tool associated with the `rundll32.exe` execution to ascertain if it was spawned by a known legitimate process or a suspicious parent process.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Utilize network monitoring tools to evaluate if `rundll32.exe` initiated any unusual outbound connections or if any unexpected remote DLL files were accessed.
  - **Review System Logs:** Correlate findings with Windows Event Logs (particularly Sysmon and Application logs) to identify any associated anomalous activity, including the loading of unknown or suspicious DLLs.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium, as the detection of remote DLL loading via `rundll32.exe` represents a significant potential risk for code execution and lateral movement within the network, warranting timely investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may miss legitimate instances where `rundll32.exe` is used for benign purposes, resulting in false positives, especially in corporate environments where remote DLL loading is a standard practice. Additionally, some attacks might employ alternative methods or utilities to achieve remote code execution that do not utilize `rundll32.exe`. The rule also assumes that Sysmon is properly configured to capture relevant image load events and that no logging mechanisms are bypassed by advanced adversaries.

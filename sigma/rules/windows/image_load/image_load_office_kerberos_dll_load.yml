  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances in which a Kerberos DLL is loaded by various Microsoft Office applications, such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. The underlying logic is based on analyzing image load events, specifically monitoring for actions where the specified Office executables are found to load the `kerberos.dll`. This DLL is often used for authentication processes, and its unexpected loading can suggest potential malicious activity, such as launching unauthorized authentication attempts or facilitating lateral movement by exploiting trusted processes. The relevant technical data sources for this rule include Windows Sysmon Image Load events, which provide information about the processes and their associated DLLs as they are loaded into memory.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution, specifically under the technique T1204.002, which addresses malicious documents that can trigger code execution through trusted applications, enhancing the need for incident responders to be aware of unexpected behavior associated with Office products.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Origins:** Validate the process tree for the Office application that initiated the DLL load to confirm it is running from a legitimate directory, not a suspicious location.
  - **Analyze Recent Activities:** Review logs from the EDR or Sysmon for any recent activities linked to the Office application prior to the DLL loading event to identify any unusual behaviors or processes that could indicate compromise.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Query network connection logs to determine if there were any outbound connections made by the Office application around the same time as the DLL loading, as this may indicate data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Review User Context:** Examine the user activity who executed the Office application to assess if it aligns with their normal behavior patterns and whether the user has administrative privileges that could indicate a higher risk of exploitation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized authentication actions via a trusted office application, which may be a precursor to deeper intrusion attempts or data leakage.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where the Kerberos DLL is legitimately loaded by Office applications as part of regular operations, potentially leading to false negatives. Additionally, if attackers utilize legitimate user accounts or employ techniques to obfuscate their activities, such as process injection or using a different method to load the DLL, the rule would likely fail to trigger. Engineers should be aware that in environments with restrictive application whitelisting, legitimate use cases may also go undetected.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential DLL sideloading activities related to the `EACore.dll` file, which is commonly associated with Electronic Arts (EA) software. The rule focuses specifically on instances where `EACore.dll` is loaded but does not originate from the legitimate path of `C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\EA Desktop\`, which can indicate an attempt to execute malicious code by exploiting the trusted softwareâ€™s environment. The rule looks for events logged in the image load category, specifically monitoring the event where the image file loaded ends with `EACore.dll` while ensuring it does not match the known legitimate executable path. This activity is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of **Defense Evasion** and **Privilege Escalation**, specifically in the techniques of **T1574.001** (DLL Search Order Hijacking) and **T1574.002** (DLL Side-Loading). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Image Load Events:** Use EDR tools to filter and review image load events. Look specifically for instances of `EACore.dll` being loaded and note the source path of the image to identify any anomalies.
  - **Cross-reference Path Validity:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to cross-check the legitimacy of the process loading `EACore.dll`. Investigate whether the process resides in the expected directory or if it has been redirected from an unexpected path.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Examine the behavior of the parent process using the EDR to assess if it exhibits any suspicious activities, such as unauthorized network connections or modifications to system files.
  - **Check for Previous Incidents:** Review historical logs in both SIEM and log management platforms for previous occurrences of similar DLL loading. This can provide context and help establish patterns of potentially malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is prioritized as high severity because DLL sideloading can lead to unauthorized code execution, potentially granting attackers elevated privileges and long-term access to systems, making it critical to investigate promptly in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where `EACore.dll` is loaded from legitimate paths not covered by this detection, or if an adversary uses fileless techniques to avoid loading from disk. Additionally, if a legitimate user executes expected actions (e.g., opening EA software), this may generate false positives. It is assumed that logs from Windows Security and Application sources are configured correctly and that EDR visibility covers image loading activities comprehensively. Adversaries with knowledge of this detection method may choose to load DLLs from inline or unexpected paths, thereby evading detection.

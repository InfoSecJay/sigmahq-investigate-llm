  ### Technical Context
  The "Sysmon File Executable Creation Detected" rule is designed to monitor Windows environments for any instances of executable files being created, as indicated by Sysmon's `FileExecutableDetected` event (EventID 29). When a Portable Executable (PE) file is created, Sysmon will log this event, capturing valuable metadata such as the file path, hash, and the process responsible for the creation. This monitoring is critical for detecting potential malware deployment or the unauthorized creation of malicious executables, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's tactics for defense evasion. By identifying anomalous executable file creations, SOC analysts can investigate and respond to malicious activities more effectively.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Use Sysmon logs to identify the timestamp and details of the `FileExecutableDetected` event. Look for unusual file paths and creation processes that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Correlation with Processes:** Utilize EDR solutions to correlate the creation of the executable with other process activities, checking if the parent process exhibits suspicious behavior or known malicious indicators.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Analyze network connection events surrounding the time of executable creation to identify any data exfiltration or command and control communications (primarily through the use of NDR tools).
  - **Assess File Reputation:** Use threat intelligence tools and AV solutions to assess the reputation of the created executable, ensuring it is not associated with known vulnerabilities or threats.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is considered medium due to the potential for executable files to indicate malicious activities, such as malware installation or unauthorized software deployment, which could lead to threats in the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where Sysmon is not configured to log file executable events, or if an attacker is leveraging anti-forensics techniques to manipulate event logging. Additionally, certain legitimate activities, such as software updates or internal deployments, may trigger these alerts, leading to false positives. Engineers should be aware that adept adversaries might use methods like process hollowing or runtime packing to obfuscate their malicious executables, potentially preventing detection.

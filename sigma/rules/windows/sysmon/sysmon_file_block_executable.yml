  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Sysmon Blocked Executable" is designed to detect any events where the Sysmon service records a "FileBlockExecutable" event with EventID 27. This specific event indicates that a file execution attempt has violated a configured block policy, which is often a mechanism employed as part of an organization's security measures to prevent the execution of malicious or unwanted applications. The detection leverages Windows Sysmon logs, focusing on monitoring file execution activity and ensuring adherence to security policies defined by the organization. By analyzing these logs, security teams can identify potential threats and remediation actions, fitting into the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Defense Evasion" (TA0042) and the technique of blocking executable files (T1203).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Sysmon Logs**: Start by querying the Sysmon logs for EventID 27 to identify the blocked executables, capturing details such as the file path and user attempting the execution.
  - **Check Process Context**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze the context of the blocked process, including parent process details and command-line parameters, to understand the intention behind the execution attempt.
  - **Correlate with Other Events**: Look for any correlated events in other logs (e.g., Security, Application) around the same timeframe to identify if similar behaviors or patterns were occurring that indicate broader suspicious activity.
  - **Assess User Behavior**: Investigate the user account involved in the blocked execution to determine if this is typical behavior or if the account shows signs of compromise or misconfiguration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity due to the potential for circumventing restrictive policies that protect the enterprise from unauthorized or malicious software execution, indicating an active attempt at evasion or exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the user is executing code through non-conventional methods or leveraging other bypass techniques that do not trigger the Sysmon FileBlockExecutable event. Additionally, the assumption is made that the Sysmon configuration is correctly set up to monitor these blocking actions, so discrepancies in Sysmon installation or logging settings could lead to missed detections. Adversaries may also disable Sysmon or alter its configuration to evade detection.

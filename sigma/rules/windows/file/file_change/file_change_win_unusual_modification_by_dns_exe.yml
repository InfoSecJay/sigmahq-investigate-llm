  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Unusual File Modification by dns.exe" is designed to monitor file changes on Windows systems specifically targeting modifications made by the process `dns.exe`. This executable is the Windows DNS Client, which is responsible for DNS resolution in the system. The focus of this rule is on detecting instances where the `dns.exe` process modifies files with names ending in `.log`, specifically `dns.log`. Such unexpected modifications could indicate malicious activities such as remote code execution or exploitation attempts related to vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-1350 (SigRed). By utilizing event data from file change logs, security analysts can identify potential unauthorized activities performed by processes that typically should not modify log files. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic for Initial Access and specifically targets technique T1133.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Activity:** Investigate the command-line arguments and parent process of the `dns.exe` instance that triggered the alert using EDR tools. This could unveil unusual invocation patterns or suspicious parent processes, which may indicate malicious behavior.
    
  - **Review File Modifications:** Examine the timestamps and contents of the `dns.log` file for anomalies or unexpected entries, potentially using Windows Event Logs or file integrity monitoring tools. This helps substantiate whether the modifications were legitimate or indicative of exploitation.
    
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Utilize logs from network detection and response (NDR) tools to look for suspicious DNS queries originating from the affected host. Evaluate if any external communications coincide with the time of file modification that may suggest command and control activities.
  - **Assess Historical Data:** Query security logs (such as Windows Security) to review any previous modifications from `dns.exe` or similar log files. This analysis can reveal patterns or previous incidents that may correlate with the current alert and help establish whether ongoing malicious activity is present.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized file modifications by system processes, which may indicate exploitation attempts or active intrusions in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where file logging is done differently or if logging is turned off. Additionally, legitimate applications or maintenance routines that modify `dns.log` may not trigger the alert, leading to false negatives or less visible malicious activities. Furthermore, adversaries could create new files or use legitimate processes in unexpected ways to evade detection, thereby affecting the rule's effectiveness.

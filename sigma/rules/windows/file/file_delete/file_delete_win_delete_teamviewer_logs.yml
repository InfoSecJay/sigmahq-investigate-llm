  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "TeamViewer Log File Deleted" targets the deletion of log files associated with TeamViewer, which could indicate an attempt by an adversary to erase forensic evidence from the system. This rule scans for events related to file deletions specifically where file names contain "TeamViewer_" and end with the ".log" extension. The logs are monitored through Windows operating system telemetry, focusing on file deletion events captured in the Windows Security log category. By filtering deletion events to only those executed by the `svchost.exe` process, the rule aims to catch potentially suspicious file deletions that are not executed by expected legitimate processes. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** and technique **T1070.004 
  - File Deletion**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Recent Deletion Events:** Use the Windows Security event logs to check for recent deletion events in the timeframe surrounding the alert activation, specifically looking for the `Event ID 4663`, which indicates that an object was deleted.
    
  - **Check the Source Process:** Investigate the context of the process responsible for the deletion by utilizing an EDR tool to trace back any potential malicious activity associated with `svchost.exe`, including parent-child process relationships.
  - **Analyze TeamViewer Usage:** If TeamViewer is installed and utilized in the environment, confirm whether its use is legitimate or tied to known users during the alert period, checking for remote access patterns or signs of misuse.
  - **Cross-reference with Other Logs:** Correlate the deletion alerts with other logs from sources like Proxy and VPN to determine if there were associated remote access attempts or other suspicious activities occurring at the same time.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as low severity due to the possibility of legitimate users deleting these log files; however, it should not be overlooked as it could indicate an ongoing compromise or cover-up effort by a threat actor.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One assumption is that users are not routinely performing maintenance that involves log deletions, which might lead to false positives if such activities are common within the organization. The rule may fail to fire if TeamViewer logs are deleted by processes outside the `svchost.exe` context or if logs are cleared manually without triggering standard Windows filesystem events. Additionally, if adaptive malware is implemented to bypass these log monitoring techniques, the detection capability could be negated.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule monitors for the deletion of IIS WebServer access logs, which are located in the directory `C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\`. These logs are crucial for tracking web server activity and potential unauthorized access attempts. The rule specifically looks for instances where files with a `.log` extension are deleted, which may indicate an effort to remove forensic evidence following a malicious activity. The detection leverages Windows file deletion logs, focusing on events that contain the target file path and end with the `.log` extension. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for defense evasion (T1070), where adversaries may seek to disrupt or erase the logs for ongoing operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Logs:** Start by examining EDR logs for any deletion events related to IIS logs. Look for processes that might have executed the deletion, along with timestamps and user accounts involved.
    
  - **Analyze File System Activity:** Use file system monitoring tools or Windows Security event logs to trace any unusual file deletion activity around the time of the alert. Pay special attention to the user permissions for these actions.
  - **Correlate with Application Logs:** Check IIS and application logs to identify any potentially related suspicious activity that occurred prior to the deletion event. This could provide context if the deletion was linked to a specific event.
  - **Examine User Access and Permissions:** Investigate the permissions of the user account associated with the deletion. Determine if the account has legitimate access to delete these logs or if it shows signs of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level of this alert indicates that while the deletion of IIS access logs is concerning, it may not always denote immediate harm, especially if linked to legitimate actions like log rotation or service uninstallation. However, it requires prompt investigation given the potential implications of evidence tampering.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if IIS access logs are configured to store in a different directory or are not monitored correctly. Additionally, legitimate log management processes, such as automatic log cleans or service troubleshooting, can suppress alerts and create false positives. Responders must consider alternate logging paths or configurations set by administrators that could lead to undetected log deletions.

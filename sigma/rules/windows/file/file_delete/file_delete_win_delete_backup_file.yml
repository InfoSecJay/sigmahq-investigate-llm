  Adversaries may delete or remove built-in operating system data and turn off services
  designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted system to prevent recovery.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Backup Files Deleted" Sigma rule is designed to detect the deletion of files with extensions typically associated with backup data, such as `.bak`, `.vhd`, and `.bkf`. This rule monitors events related to file deletions initiated by common command-line interfaces and scripts, including `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and process loading tools such as `rundll32.exe` or `regsvr32.exe`. Such deletions are often the actions of adversaries trying to obstruct recovery efforts by removing critical backup files that can restore system operations after an attack or data corruption, effectively falling under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Impact (T1490).
  To function, the rule analyzes logs from Windows, specifically targeting file deletion events (`file_delete`). By focusing on particular process identifiers and the targeted file extensions, the detection mechanism aims to identify when potentially malicious actions are taken against backup files. This can significantly help in mitigating risks and facilitating timely responses to potential data compromise incidents.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Source of Deletions:** Examine the event logs in the EDR for the user account and machine where the deletion occurred. Correlate activity with recent logins or unexpected behavior patterns.
    
  - **Analyze Command History:** Check PowerShell or Command Prompt history for the commands executed prior to deletion. Look for any unusual or suspicious command usage that might indicate malicious intent.
  - **Cross-check with Backup Policies:** Review existing data retention and backup policies to determine if the deleted files were part of legitimate operations. This can help differentiate between benign and malicious deletions.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Utilize network logs to determine if there was any unusual activity from external IP addresses around the time of the deletion. It may indicate an attacker leveraging a compromised system.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level primarily due to the importance of backup files in recovery processes within an enterprise environment. Malicious deletion of these files can severely impact recovery efforts following an incident, making rapid investigation critical.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where adversaries use alternative deletion methods that do not invoke standard logging, such as using direct disk access or low-level file manipulation techniques. Additionally, if a legitimate administrator or automated process removes these files during routine maintenance, the rule may generate false positives. There is an assumption that all necessary logs are properly configured and retained, which might not be the case in all enterprise environments.

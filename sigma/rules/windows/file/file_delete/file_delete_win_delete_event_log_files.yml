  ### Technical Context
  The "EventLog EVTX File Deleted" Sigma rule focuses on detecting the deletion of Windows event log files, specifically targeting files with the `.evtx` extension located in the `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\` directory. This action is often a red flag, indicating potential attempts by malicious actors to eliminate traces of their activities and cover their tracks, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host). The rule utilizes file deletion logs to report on instances where these critical event logs have been removed. By monitoring file deletion events, incident responders can gain insights into potentially unauthorized or suspicious activities aimed at undermining the integrity of system-wide audit trails.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Deletion Logs:** Review Windows Security event logs for file deletion events (Event ID 4663) that correlate with the timestamps of the alert to confirm unauthorized deletions.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Using EDR tools, examine user activity and logs leading up to the event to identify any unusual access patterns or accounts that may be implicated in the deletion.
  - **Review System Changes:** Assess recent changes to system configurations or installed applications to determine if any legitimate maintenance activities may explain the log deletion.
  - **Correlate with Other Events:** Investigate related events in Sysmon logs like process creations and command-line arguments to identify any processes that correspond with the deletion of the event log files.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a medium severity level as the deletion of event log files is often part of a larger strategy of evasion by threat actors, warranting prompt investigation to ascertain the intent and extent of the activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if file deletion events are not being logged appropriately due to misconfigured audit policies or if an adversary has established a credible method to delete logs without generating an event (e.g., through low-level API calls). Furthermore, legitimate system maintenance or administrative actions can generate false positives, necessitating careful review of context surrounding findings.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Prefetch File Deleted" Sigma rule is designed to detect the deletion of prefetch files on Windows systems, which typically reside in the `C:\Windows\Prefetch` directory and have a `.pf` file extension. Prefetch files are used by Windows to expedite the boot and application launch processes, but their deletion can signify a potential attack, particularly in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1070.004). This rule monitors deletion events logged by the Windows operating system, specifically focusing on file deletion activities.
  The rule triggers when a file deletion event is logged that includes a target filename containing the string "C:\Windows\Prefetch\" and ending with the ".pf" extension. It also includes a filter to exclude deletions performed by the `svchost.exe` process, which is commonly used for legitimate system activities. By analyzing file deletion logs, incident responders may uncover attempts by adversaries to obfuscate their tracks or thwart forensic analysis by removing evidence of their activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Windows Event Logs:** Review the Security Event Logs for file deletion events (Event ID 11) corresponding to the identified prefetch files. Cross-reference these events with the time of reported suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Utilize your EDR tool to investigate processes running before and after the deletion event. Pay special attention to any anomalous process behaviors or associations with known malicious activities.
  - **Examine User Context:** Look into the user account associated with the deletion event to determine if it aligns with expected usage patterns and permissions. Verify whether the account has elevated privileges that could facilitate unauthorized actions.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check firewall, proxy, and application logs for possibly related user activity. This could provide additional context on whether a broader campaign is occurring or if the deletion was an isolated incident.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity as the deletion of prefetch files could indicate that an adversary is attempting to obliterate traces of their activity, which may hinder forensic analysis and compromise an organization's ability to investigate security incidents.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Potential blind spots for this rule include scenarios where prefetch files are not monitored, or where legitimate processes also perform file deletions under atypical circumstances that aren't captured by the filtering conditions. Additionally, if an attacker uses systems or processes directly tied to legitimate users, monitoring may not reveal suspicious activity. The assumption here is that all relevant telemetry sources are correctly ingesting logs, and that adversaries are not utilizing obfuscation techniques that would prevent detection.

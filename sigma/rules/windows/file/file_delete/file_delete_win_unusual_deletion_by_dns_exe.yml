  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect unusual file deletion activities conducted by the `dns.exe` process on Windows systems. Specifically, it monitors for instances where `dns.exe` is responsible for deleting log files, particularly targeting those ending with `dns.log`. The rationale behind this rule stems from the understanding that legitimate operations involving `dns.exe` should not typically involve the deletion of log files; hence, such an event could be indicative of unauthorized behavior. This behavior may be associated with tactics like Initial Access (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Initial Access, Technique T1133) where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2020-1350 (SigRed), to manipulate or infiltrate systems. The relevant data sources for this detection include the Windows file deletion logs, which track activities that could signify potential exploitation or malicious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution with EDR**: Utilize your EDR solution to validate the `dns.exe` execution context, including its parent processes, command-line arguments, and execution time to determine whether it aligns with legitimate DNS operations.
  - **Review Security Event Logs**: Examine the Windows Security Event Logs for any accompanying alerts related to `dns.exe` around the time of the deletion, which may indicate abnormal activity or patterns consistent with attacks.
  - **Investigate File Access History**: Utilize file system auditing logs to understand the access history of the deleted `dns.log` file, looking for previous writes or reads that could suggest manipulation prior to deletion.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic**: Inspect network logs through your NDR tools for any unusual DNS queries made by the same `dns.exe` process, especially those that may coincide with the file deletion event.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because unexpected deletions of log files, particularly by critical system components like `dns.exe`, may indicate potential exploitation or a compromise of system integrity, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are certain limitations associated with this rule. For instance, if `dns.exe` is executed as a part of legitimate automated scripts or maintenance tasks that delete logs after processing, those events may not trigger the alert. Furthermore, if an adversary compromises `dns.exe` with malicious modifications, it could evade detection. Additionally, scenarios where DNS logging is disabled would lead to no relevant data being captured to support this rule, potentially hindering detection efforts.

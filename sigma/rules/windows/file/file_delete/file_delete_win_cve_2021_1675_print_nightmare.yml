  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potential exploitation attempts of the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675) by monitoring for DLL deletions in the Spooler Service driver folder. The rule specifically looks for instances where the process `spoolsv.exe` (the Print Spooler service) deletes files in the Windows driver path, which could indicate malicious activity attempting to exploit this vulnerability. By targeting the deletion of critical DLL files associated with printing services, the rule addresses techniques under the MITRE ATT&CK framework that focus on persistence, defense evasion, and privilege escalation, specifically tactic T1574. Detecting such actions early can aid in preventing full exploitation and maintaining the integrity of the system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR logs:** Review Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs to identify further details about the context of the deletion events, including associated processes and user activity prior to the deletions.
  - **Analyze Windows Event Logs:** Inspect the Security, System, and Application event logs around the time of the alert to correlate with any unauthorized access attempts or unusual print job activity.
  - **Review File Integrity Monitoring:** Utilize file integrity monitoring tools to evaluate any additional unauthorized changes to critical system files or configurations impacted by the Print Spooler.
  - **Examine Network Traffic:** Analyze network communications involving the spooling service to determine if there are any suspicious connections or attempts to send or receive unusual print jobs.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity of this alert, it indicates a significant threat to the enterprise environment, suggesting potential exploits that could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized system access if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the deletion actions are carried out by legitimate administrative tools or if the attacker employs methods to obscure the activity. Additionally, some environments might have different configurations or access controls that could prevent necessary monitoring or logging of the Spooler service operations. Analysts should also consider false negatives that could arise from rapid response measures like system reboots, which may return the environment to a safe state before the rule is able to fire.

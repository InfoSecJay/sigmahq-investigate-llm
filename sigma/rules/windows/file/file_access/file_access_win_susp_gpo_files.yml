  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets potentially unauthorized access to sensitive files stored on the Windows Sysvol share, which is critical for Group Policy management in Windows environments. The rule specifically monitors access requests to a predefined list of important Sysvol files, such as `Registry.pol` and `GptTmpl.inf`. It captures file access events where the file path begins with `\\`, indicating a network access attempt. The rule employs the ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) provider for kernel file access, leveraging telemetry from the Windows operating system.
  By filtering out common applications such as `explorer.exe` and process paths typical of legitimate system applications (e.g., those in `C:\Program Files`), this rule is designed to identify potentially suspicious or uncommon applications attempting to access sensitive files. The monitoring aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access, specifically technique T1552.006, highlighting the potential threat to credential information stored in these files.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts for Associated Processes**: Look for any alerts related to the processes that triggered this detection to understand if they are part of legitimate user activity or anomalous behavior.
  - **Review File Access Logs**: Inspect file access logs on the Sysvol share to correlate the time and context of the access attempts tracked by the rule with user activity.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic**: Utilize NDR tools to identify any relevant network connections initiated by the suspicious applications accessing Sysvol files, focusing on potential lateral movement within the network.
  - **Examine User Accounts Accessing the Sysvol Share**: Validate the account activity against known legitimate users and service accounts to determine if there is any unauthorized access or unusual patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity is categorized as medium due to the detection of file access requests that may indicate credential harvesting attempts; however, this can also represent legitimate administrative tasks in some contexts. It's crucial for the SOC to prioritize investigation based on the application behavior and the users involved.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that access to Sysvol files by commonly used applications is benign, which may not account for all scenarios. Additionally, it relies on correct ETW logging, so if Sysmon or ETW tracing is misconfigured or disabled, the detection will not fire. Adversaries may also evade detection by using legitimate applications or tools that are not included in the filters, highlighting the importance of regular auditing and context in interpreting alerts.

  Detects the creation of a binary file with the ".sed" extension. The ".sed" extension stand for Self Extraction Directive files.
  These files are used by the "iexpress.exe" utility in order to create self extracting packages.
  Attackers were seen abusing this utility and creating PE files with embedded ".sed" entries.
  Usually ".sed" files are simple ini files and not PE binaries.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of files with the ".sed" extension, which are associated with the Windows utility "iexpress.exe". IExpress is commonly used for creating self-extracting packages, and attackers have been observed misusing this functionality to embed malicious payloads within PE files that reference simple INI-like configuration files. The key technical data sources involved in this rule include Windows file system logs that capture executable file creations. The rule references the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218, which relates to the exploitation of system tools for defensive evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Events:** Check the file creation logs on the endpoint to confirm the details of the ".sed" file, including the timestamp and user account that initiated the creation.
    
  - **Analyze Related Processes:** Use your EDR tool to trace any processes spawned as a result of this file creation, specifically looking for instances of "iexpress.exe" and any parent processes that may indicate unusual behavior.
    
  - **Conduct Threat Hunting in Logs:** Correlate the event with other security logs, such as Windows Security and Sysmon logs, to identify any suspicious activity patterns or connections to known malicious IPs or domains.
  - **Evaluate the Context of Supposed Usage:** Determine if the user account that created the file typically utilizes IExpress or similar tools, as this can aid in distinguishing legitimate usage from potential malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for misuse of IExpress by adversaries, which may indicate a preparatory step for further malicious actions. Underlying unsanctioned activity involving self-extracting files should not be ignored as it may signify an escalation in a broader attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where the creation of ".sed" files is legitimate and common, or if the attacker utilizes alternative file extensions to obscure their activity. Additionally, if logs are misconfigured or not preserved for a sufficient duration, relevant events could be lost, leading to missed detections. The use of various obfuscation techniques or malware that does not utilize ".sed" files can also bypass this detection entirely.

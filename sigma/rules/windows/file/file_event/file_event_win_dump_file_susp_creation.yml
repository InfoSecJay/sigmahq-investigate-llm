description: Detects the creation of a file with the ".dmp"/".hdmp" extension by a
  shell or scripting application such as "cmd", "powershell", etc. Often created by
  software during a crash. Memory dumps can sometimes contain sensitive information
  such as credentials. It's best to determine the source of the crash.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of files with the ".dmp" or ".hdmp" extensions by shell or scripting applications such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or their variants. Memory dumps, which are typically generated during application crashes, can contain sensitive information including user credentials, application data, and other critical information. The rule monitors file creation events, particularly looking for those processes that are more commonly associated with executing such scripts. This monitoring leverages Windows file event logs to track the source application responsible for generating these dump files. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic for this rule falls under "Defense Evasion" (T1203), as malicious actors may use dump files to obscure their activities or capture sensitive data.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Collect File Creation Events**: Review file creation logs to identify the specific dump files generated, ensuring to note their locations and timing in relation to other activities on the system.
  - **Correlate Process Logs**: Investigate the process creation logs in EDR to determine which user initiated the dump and assess whether it correlates with legitimate administrative tasks or unusual behavior.
  - **Analyze Associated Memory Dumps**: If accessible, analyze the content of the generated memory dumps with forensic tools to search for sensitive information or indicators of malicious activities.
  - **Investigate Source Systems**: Use log data from relevant sources (e.g., Sysmon, EDR) to trace back and analyze any precursors to the dump file creation, including system errors or unauthorized access attempts leading to application crashes.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level assigned to this alert is due to the potential for memory dumps to harbor sensitive information and the possibility of their use in malicious activities. Prompt investigation is essential to ascertain whether the dump creation is legitimate or part of a nefarious attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the creation of the ".dmp" or ".hdmp" files does not occur through the monitored processes or if file system activity is not sufficiently logged. An assumption exists that operations utilizing trusted administrative scripts, which may collect dumps, account for false positives, suggesting that additional context and safeguards are necessary to minimize unwarranted alerts. Additionally, adversaries may employ sophisticated techniques to manipulate legitimate processes or utilize less common scripting applications to evade detection.

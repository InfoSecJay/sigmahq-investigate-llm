  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential User Account Control (UAC) bypass attempts leveraging a specific path parsing vulnerability within the `winsat.exe` executable. The context of this rule lies in how an adversary may exploit improper handling of paths to execute malicious code with elevated privileges, thus circumventing security measures. When an attacker performs this type of exploitation, they commonly manipulate file paths to redirect the execution of legitimate processes or DLLs that reside in temporary folders. This rule focuses on monitoring file event logs for any access to `winsat.exe` or `winmm.dll` found in the temporary application data directory alongside `C:\Users\`. 
  The relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with this rule are `T1548.002 
  - Abusing Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control`. Detecting and responding to these alerts is critical for maintaining compliance with security protocols, as they reveal attempts to gain unauthorized escalated privileges within a Windows environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Context:** Examine the parent-child relationship of the `winsat.exe` or `winmm.dll` processes using EDR solutions. Confirm that they were executed from an expected or legitimate source.
  - **Review User Activity:** Utilize logs from Windows Security to trace the user activity leading up to the alert. Look for any unusual user behavior or access patterns.
  - **Analyze File Path:** Check if the same paths appear in the user's file activity through the File Integrity Monitoring tools. This can help determine if the alert was a result of a malicious attempt or regular activity.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Investigate any associated network connections that occurred during the same timeframe via NDR logs. This may uncover communication with known malicious entities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the implications of privilege escalation it suggests. A successful bypass of UAC mechanisms can lead to significant risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data or control of critical systems within the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary employs alternate methods of UAC bypass that do not involve the specified executables or if the paths have been modified. Additionally, if necessary logging levels are not implemented or file access is obfuscated through steganography techniques, the detection could fail. It assumes that file event telemetry is correctly configured and that users are not privy to potential detection methods.

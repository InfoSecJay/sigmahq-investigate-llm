  malware as a method to abuse the fact that Windows hide default extensions by default.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Double Extension Files" Sigma rule is designed to identify potentially malicious files that employ double extension naming conventions, a common technique used by attackers to disguise executable files. This technique exploits the Windows operating system's default behavior of hiding known file extensions, allowing an attacker to save a malicious file as, for example, "document.pdf.exe," misleading users into believing it is a harmless document. The rule analyzes file creation events on Windows systems, specifically looking for files with target filenames that end with executable extensions (such as .exe, .iso, .rar, or .zip) and contain certain legitimate document extensions (like .docx., .jpg., or .pdf.). By monitoring categorized file events, it can capture suspicious activities indicative of defense evasion tactics (MITRE ATT&CK tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique T1036.007).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Events:** Query the file event logs on the affected systems to identify the creation of files with suspicious double extensions, checking the time and context around their creation.
  - **Analyze File Properties:** For identified files, inspect their properties, including size, hash values, and digital signatures using your EDR solutions to determine if they are legitimate or hazardous.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Use your SIEM to correlate the file creation events with any related events such as process creation and command-line execution to assess whether these files were executed immediately after creation.
  - **Conduct Threat Research:** Search for any known indicators of compromise (IoCs) tied to the identified filenames in threat intelligence platforms or databases to evaluate if they are linked to known malware campaigns.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered high due to the potential risk posed by double extension files, which are frequently employed by attackers to deliver malicious payloads while masquerading as benign files. Rapid response is essential to mitigate potential breaches or successful attacks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where security measures like file extension visibility are configured differently, or where legitimate applications utilize similar double extension naming without malicious intent. Additionally, the rule relies on accurate file event logging; if file creation events are not logged due to misconfiguration or if an attacker uses unconventional methods for executing malicious code (e.g., memory-based techniques), the detection may fail. Analysts should also be aware that advanced adversaries may refine their tactics to avoid detection by using valid processes or obfuscating their file naming conventions further.

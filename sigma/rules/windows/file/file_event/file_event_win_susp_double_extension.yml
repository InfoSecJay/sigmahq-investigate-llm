description: Detects dropped files with double extensions, which is often used by
  malware as a method to abuse the fact that Windows hide default extensions by default.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious file behaviors associated with double extension files, a common tactic used by malware authors to disguise malicious executables as benign documents or media files. The rule inspects file creation events in a Windows environment, particularly looking for files that end with common extension patterns such as `.exe`, `.iso`, `.zip`, and `.rar`, but also contain secondary extensions like `.doc.`, `.jpg.`, or `.pdf.`. By leveraging process creation logs and file event logs, it focuses on identifying potentially harmful files that could bypass user scrutiny due to Windowsâ€™ default behavior of hiding extensions.
  The detection logic uses two main selection criteria: the first identifies files with potentially valid double extensions, while the second narrows it down to specific harmful combinations like `.rar.exe` and `.zip.exe`. The use of these double extensions indicates a likelihood that a malicious actor is attempting to deceive users into executing harmful binaries, posing a high threat to systems if left unmonitored.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Search the EDR logs for the identified filenames related to the alert, focusing on the process tree and execution context to understand how the file was executed.
  - Review file creation events in the file event logs to ascertain the origin and behavior of the suspicious files, noting their paths and any associated parent processes.
  - Check the web proxy logs for any downloads leading to the creation of these files, investigating the domains accessed to identify potential phishing or malware distribution sites.
  - Inspect any related AV alerts or cloud activity logs to see if any subsequent actions were taken by endpoint protection solutions, indicating whether the suspicious files were flagged or quarantined.

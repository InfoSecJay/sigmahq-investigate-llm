  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Office Macro File Download" is designed to detect the creation of macro-enabled Office files (e.g., `.docm`, `.xlsm`, etc.) through common applications such as email clients and web browsers. This rule leverages logs from Windows file events to monitor for specific executable processes known to facilitate the download and creation of these files. It specifically looks for file creation events where the target file name ends with the extensions typically associated with Office macro files. Additionally, it recognizes filenames that include a 'Zone' identifier, which indicates that the file originated from an untrusted location. This detection corresponds with MITRE ATT&CK tactic *Initial Access* and technique *T1566.001: Spear Phishing Attachment*, highlighting the importance of monitoring for potential phishing attempts that deliver malicious macros.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine the EDR logs:** Check the process creation logs for any instances of monitored applications (e.g., Outlook, Chrome) running at the time the macro file was created, and verify if they correlate with legitimate user activity.
  - **Investigate the file's metadata:** Utilize file analysis tools to examine the properties of the detected macro files, looking for unusual attributes that might indicate malicious intent or tampering.
  - **Review email attachments and browsing history:** Cross-reference the identified email clients and browser history to ascertain whether the macro files were downloaded from suspicious or unfamiliar sources.
  - **Assess network activity:** Use the NDR or proxy logs to analyze outbound connections made by the related applications, identifying any connections to known malicious domains at the time of the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with macro-enabled documents, which can serve as delivery mechanisms for malware. In an enterprise environment, timely investigation is crucial as successful exploitation could lead to further compromise.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot is the rule's reliance on specific file extensions and process names; if a malicious actor uses less common applications or obfuscates the file types, the detection may fail. Additionally, legitimate use cases (like authorized downloads of macro files) may lead to false positives, requiring analysts to carefully assess context. It's assumed that all tracked processes will log relevant file events; however, environments with customized or limited logging configurations might not capture these events.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Startup Folder Persistence" Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of files with specified suspicious extensions within the Windows Startup folder. This folder serves as a common place for ensuring programs automatically launch when a user logs into their account. The rule specifically monitors file creations, focusing on extensions commonly associated with scripting, such as `.vbs`, `.ps1`, and executable file types including `.msi` and `.dll`. By leveraging file event logs, the rule assesses whether any new entries in the Startup directory match the criteria, indicating a potential persistence mechanism employed by adversaries as part of the MITRE ATT&CK technique for "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547.001). 
  The primary data source involved in this detection is the Windows File Event logs, which track file-related activities, enabling the SOC to identify unauthorized or potentially malicious modifications to the startup behavior on systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Assess the Alert Context:** Review the alert details in the SIEM for the file path, filename, and timestamp. Cross-reference these with known legitimate applications to determine the validity of the file creation.
  - **Correlate EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs around the time the suspicious file was created. Look for abnormal command-line parameters or parent-child process relationships that may indicate malicious activity.
  - **Check for User Activity:** Investigate the user account that generated the file using Windows Security logs. Determine if the user's account shows signs of compromise or if they were acting anomalously.
  - **Analyze the Startup Folder:** Directly review the contents of the Startup folder on the affected system. Assess whether any additional suspicious files exist, or if modifications were made to legitimate entries that could indicate tampering.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a high severity due to the potential for persistence mechanisms that allow adversaries to maintain access to compromised systems, making it critical for timely investigation to prevent further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the monitoring of file event logs is properly configured and that the suspicious file extensions list includes all potential malicious extensions applicable to the environment. There may be blind spots related to variations in legitimate software behavior that use the same extensions, which could lead to false positives. Moreover, sophisticated adversaries may employ techniques to disguise their payloads or utilize legitimate files, bypassing this detection.

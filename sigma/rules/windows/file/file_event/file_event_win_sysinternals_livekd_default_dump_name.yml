  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "LiveKD Kernel Memory Dump File Created" is designed to detect the creation of a specific file named 'livekd.dmp' in the Windows operating system. The presence of this file often indicates that an unauthorized user may be attempting to perform kernel memory dumping, which is a common technique used by attackers to extract sensitive information from the system's memory, or perform privilege escalation. The rule leverages file event logs to monitor for this specific target filename, which corresponds to a known and potentially malicious activity. This detection fits within the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of "Defense Evasion" (as attackers may attempt to mask their presence) and "Privilege Escalation" (as enabling access to kernel memory can lead to elevated privileges).
  To gather the necessary data for this detection, the rule utilizes Windows Security event logs that provide insights into file creation events. By focusing on the creation of the 'livekd.dmp' file, this detection aims to flag suspicious activities that could compromise system integrity and confidentiality.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Creation Context:** Investigate the context of the file creation by reviewing the file creation event in Windows Security logs. Look for any user accounts and processes that were active at that time.
  - **Analyze Related Process Activity:** Use EDR tools to analyze process activity around the time the 'livekd.dmp' file was created. Look for any suspicious or unauthorized processes that may have initiated the file creation.
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters:** If available, examine the command-line parameters of processes associated with the file creation. Check for any arguments that may indicate malicious intent or this fileâ€™s creation as part of an attack.
  - **Assess User Accounts Involved:** Investigate the user accounts involved during the time of file creation. Focus on any accounts that are not typically associated with administrative actions to assess potential unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerting on the creation of 'livekd.dmp' is assigned a high severity level due to the potential risk that arises from an attacker having kernel access. This activity often indicates an attempt to bypass security mechanisms and extract sensitive data from memory.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the file is created using methods that do not generate standard file creation events, such as advanced techniques used by skilled adversaries. Additionally, false positives could occur in environments where authorized administrators are executing live kernel debugging, though this practice should ideally be restricted in production systems. It's crucial for engineers to recognize that legitimate administrative usage may need to be filtered out, thus requiring context-aware analysis during investigations.

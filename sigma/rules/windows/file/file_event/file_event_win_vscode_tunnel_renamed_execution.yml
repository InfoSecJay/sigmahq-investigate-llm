  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Renamed VsCode Code Tunnel Execution 
  - File Indicator" is designed to detect anomalous activity associated with the execution of the Visual Studio Code (VsCode) tunneling utility. Specifically, the rule focuses on identifying the creation of a file named "code_tunnel.json," which suggests that some process is leveraging VsCode's tunneling capabilities without being recognized as either the legitimate VsCode executable or its expected associated processes. This is significant because malicious actors sometimes use these tools to create command-and-control (C2) tunnels to bypass network security measures. 
  To effectively monitor for this activity, the rule utilizes telemetry from file events on Windows systems, specifically focused on filenames that end with “\code_tunnel.json.” It further filters for the image path of the process invoking the file creation to ensure that the detected behavior does not hail from recognized VsCode instances. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Command and Control** under the technique of **Application Layer Protocol** since the potential misuse of legitimate applications can facilitate an attacker's remote control and obfuscation efforts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Events:** Check Windows file event logs to confirm the creation of "code_tunnel.json" and capture the corresponding process ID and user context.
  - **Analyze Process Creation:** Utilize an EDR tool to examine the process tree for the executing process associated with the file creation, determining if it stems from any known VsCode images.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Investigate network connections established by the relevant process during the timeframe of the file's creation to identify any anomalous outbound traffic that could indicate a command-and-control tunnel.
  - **Correlate with User and System Logs:** Cross-reference the identified process with user activity logs and system events to assess whether the execution pattern aligns with standard operational behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is categorized as high because the creation of a tunneling utility file by an unexpected process indicates potential misuse of legitimate software that can enable unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration, escalating the urgency for investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in scenarios where the file creation occurs via legitimate or expected processes that were not included in the whitelist. Additionally, if the adversary renames the executable or utilizes obfuscation techniques to mask their activity, this rule could potentially miss identifying malicious behavior. It assumes that file monitoring is adequately configured and that key telemetry points are being collected.

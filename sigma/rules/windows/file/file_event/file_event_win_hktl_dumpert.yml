  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the creation of the default dump file, `dumpert.dmp`, utilized by the Outflank Dumpert tool, a known process dumper used for extracting sensitive information, including credentials, from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory on Windows systems. When an adversary deploys this tool, it typically generates a memory dump file that may include sensitive data, making it a critical indicator of potential credential theft. The rule specifically monitors for file events that correlate to process memory dumping, leveraging the capabilities of Windows Security to track file creation actions. The associated MITRE ATT&CK technique for this behavior is T1003.001 (Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory), which pertains directly to unauthorized access to credential information on a target system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Alert:** Use EDR to investigate the process tree and confirm that the `dumpert.dmp` file creation is linked to unauthorized or suspicious processes, such as instances of Dumpert or related tools. Look for any corresponding parent processes that may indicate how Dumpert was executed.
  - **Inspect File Contents:** If possible, examine the `dumpert.dmp` file for suspicious content or patterns that could indicate the recovery of credentials or other sensitive information. Utilize memory analysis tools for in-depth inspection.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Review Windows Security event logs to assess any unusual activity around the time of the dump file creation. Assess surrounding events for possible lateral movement or other malicious actions that may have preceded the creation.
  - **Check for Remnants of Compromise:** Utilize network detection tools to examine outbound connections from the affected system that could indicate exfiltration attempts or command and control communication after the dump was created.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the critical nature of this alert, the creation of a `dumpert.dmp` file suggests a potential compromise of sensitive credentials, warranting immediate investigation. This could indicate an active attack scenario with severe implications for account security and data integrity.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the dumpert tool is configured to use a different naming convention or if there is obfuscation involved in its execution. Furthermore, if the process-relative permissions are altered before executing a dump, it may succeed without generating alerts. It's crucial to assume that adversaries might use alternative methods or tools to achieve similar outcomes, which could bypass detection entirely.

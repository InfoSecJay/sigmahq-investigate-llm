  ### Technical Context
  The "Legitimate Application Dropped Archive" Sigma rule focuses on detecting instances where certain well-known applications on Windows systems, such as Microsoft Office products and various utilities, write archive files (e.g., `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, etc.) to disk. This behavior is typically unexpected and can indicate misuse of these applications for malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration or the delivery of malicious payloads. By monitoring file events on the end hosts, the rule identifies when these applications trigger actions leading to the creation of archives that they are not ordinarily expected to handle. 
  The technical data sources involved include file event logs, which will capture the activities associated with the specified processes. The understanding of how legitimate applications might be exploited aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of “Defense Evasion,” specifically the technique T1218, where an adversary may use trusted tools to perform malicious activities without raising immediate suspicion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Events:** Check relevant Windows Security logs for file creation events tied to the flagged applications, specifically looking for any logs indicating the creation of archive files.
    
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the process tree of the identified applications to see if any unusual parent-child relationships exist that suggest process injection or lateral movement.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use your NDR solution to correlate network connections made by the identified applications to detect any suspicious outbound communication that may indicate data exfiltration.
  - **Validate Application Integrity:** Check the integrity of the flagged applications to ensure they haven’t been altered or replaced with malicious versions by analyzing file hashes against known good baselines or using application whitelisting solutions.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as high since any unexpected behavior exhibited by trusted applications can potentially indicate malicious activities, such as data theft or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the flagged applications do not have permissions to create files, or if data exfiltration activities are achieved through other means not logged within the monitored system. Additionally, if an adversary is using a legitimate version of software that is not included in the monitored list, or if configurations are altered to suppress log generation, the detection may fail. Analysts should also be aware of the risk of false positives stemming from legitimate administrative activities involving these applications.

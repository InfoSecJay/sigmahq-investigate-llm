  Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity.
  Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for "Suspicious Screensaver Binary File Creation" aims to detect potentially malicious binaries executed as screensaver files, typically having the `.scr` extension. Adversaries can abuse screensavers to achieve persistence by executing malicious content when a user is inactive, thus remaining undetected during normal operations. The rule specifically identifies events related to the creation of screensaver files in Windows environments and analyzes file events associated with the execution of common legitimate processes that might be abusedâ€”these include `TiWorker.exe` and services related to Symantec Endpoint Protection. The data sources leveraged in this detection include Windows file event logs capturing file creations and modifications, along with process-related events that can indicate whether the execution was legitimate or potentially malicious. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence, specifically technique T1546.002.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify File Creation**: Check your file event logs for any recent entries that indicate the creation of `.scr` files, particularly during periods of user inactivity.
  - **Examine Process Parentage**: Analyze the process tree in your EDR for any suspicious parent-child relationships involving the creation of the `.scr` files, looking for unauthorized or unexpected parent processes.
  - **Assess Command-Line Arguments**: Review the command-line parameters associated with any identified processes related to the suspicious `.scr` file creation to identify anomalies or malicious intent.
  - **Review User Activity**: Confirm user activity logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs) to correlate the timing of `.scr` file execution with user inactivity to rule out legitimate usage.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of the alert is medium, as the creation of a suspicious screensaver binary could indicate an attempt by an adversary to establish persistence on the system. This malicious activity presents a risk to enterprise security, warranting timely investigation to prevent further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses unconventional filenames or exploits other less common persistence mechanisms outside the defined conditions. Additionally, the effectiveness of the rule is contingent upon proper logging configuration within the Windows environment. If file event logging is not enabled or if the logs have been tampered with, the rule could fail to capture relevant events. Analysts should also consider user behavior; an alert might be generated for legitimate screensaver files created in an educational or testing context.

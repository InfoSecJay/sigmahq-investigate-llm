  ### Technical Context
  The "VsCode Powershell Profile Modification" Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation or modification of the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) PowerShell profile file, specifically named `Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1`. This file serves as a configuration file for PowerShell sessions initiated from within VSCode, allowing users to define custom settings, aliases, functions, and other preferences. Because this profile can be manipulated for malicious purposes—including establishing persistence mechanisms—its alteration may indicate suspicious or unauthorized activity. 
  This rule leverages file event logs from Windows, monitoring changes to the specific PowerShell profile file associated with VSCode. When a file is created or modified, this log captures the relevant metadata, such as the path, time of the event, and the user account responsible for the change. The detection ties into the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of Persistence and Privilege Escalation, specifically technique T1546.013, which relates to the use of scripting and configurations to maintain access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Event Logs:** Examine Windows file event logs for evidence of creation or modification events related to `Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1`, noting the user account and process initiating the change.
    
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check logs from EDR solutions to assess the activities of the user associated with the profile change, looking for any unusual execution patterns or remote access events around the time of modification.
    
  - **Examine PowerShell Command History:** Utilize PowerShell command history logs to see if any suspicious commands were executed that could leverage the modified profile for malicious intents, such as command obfuscation or execution of unexpected scripts.
    
  - **Assess for Legitimate Usage:** Determine whether the modification aligns with legitimate user activities by consulting with the relevant teams or individuals who may have a valid reason to alter the PowerShell profile, thereby ruling out false positives.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for an adversary to use the modification of the PowerShell profile as a means of establishing persistence within the environment. Detection of such modifications warrants timely investigations to ensure that there is no malicious intent behind the changes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Please note that this rule may not trigger if the profile modification occurs through legitimate administrative actions, thereby producing false positives in active development environments. Furthermore, it assumes that file logging is enabled and capturing relevant events. Attackers may also avoid detection by altering the profile under accounts with legitimate permissions or by directly manipulating files on the system without going through PowerShell, which could bypass this monitoring.

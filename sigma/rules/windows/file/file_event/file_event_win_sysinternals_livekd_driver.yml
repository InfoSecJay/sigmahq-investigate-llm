  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "LiveKD Driver Creation" is designed to detect the instantiation of the LiveKD kernel debugging driver (`LiveKdD.SYS`) on Windows systems. This rule specifically monitors file events where the target filename matches the path to the LiveKD driver, which is frequently used for live kernel debugging. It looks for processes that are executing `livekd.exe` or `livek64.exe`, which are the executables responsible for loading this driver. This detection relies on file event sources, notably from Windows Security logs, to capture attempts to create or load this driver, indicating potential privilege escalation or defense evasion tactics being employed by malicious actors. The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics include "Defense Evasion" (T1562) and "Privilege Escalation" (T1068). 
  Detecting the creation of this driver is crucial because it can signal an attempt by unauthorized users to gain elevated privileges or manipulate kernel-level settings, making it a significant red flag for SOC analysts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Creation Logs:** Review the details of the file creation logs for `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\LiveKdD.SYS` to confirm if it aligns with any authorized activities or scheduled processes. Look for timestamps around suspicious behavior to correlate the incidents.
  - **Examine Related Process Activity:** Utilize your EDR tool to investigate the execution history of `livekd.exe` and `livek64.exe`. Identify the parent processes and the command-line arguments used during their execution to understand the context in which they were launched.
  - **Review User Privilege Changes:** Query the Windows Security logs to check for any recent privilege escalations or unauthorized changes to user roles that occurred around the time of the alert. This can help identify if a legitimate user account is being misused.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Look into any network connections made by the processes associated with LiveKD during the time frame of the alert. This could highlight any nefarious external communication that might indicate further malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the contexts in which the LiveKD driver is typically used. While it can be executed legitimately for debugging purposes, its presence in an unauthorized environment may indicate a compromised system attempting to perform kernel-level modifications or manipulate processes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that all instances of LiveKD usage are suspicious; however, legitimate usage for debugging might occur in certain environments. Additionally, the rule may not trigger if the driver is loaded by means other than file creation logs, such as if the executable type is altered or if obfuscation techniques are used by adversaries to disguise the driver. This highlights the importance of correlating additional telemetry to avoid false negatives in detection.

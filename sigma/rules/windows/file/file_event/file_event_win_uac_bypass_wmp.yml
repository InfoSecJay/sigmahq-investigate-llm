  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect a method of User Account Control (UAC) bypass via the Windows Media Player, specifically leveraging the `osksupport.dll` component. The attack utilizes `DllHost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, to execute the malicious `osk.exe` file located in the temporary files directory: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\OskSupport.dll`. By monitoring file events, this rule identifies instances when a target filename matches the expected patterns that are indicative of this type of attack. 
  The technical data sources involved in this detection include file event logs that capture file creations and modifications on Windows systems. The detection aligns with two relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Defense Evasion (T1548.002) and Privilege Escalation (T1548.002), which refer to techniques adversaries may use to elevate their permissions and bypass security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the EDR Alerts:** Check your EDR for alerts or events related to `DllHost.exe` execution, particularly within the timeframe of the alert. Look for any associated process trees that show this process interacting with `osk.exe`.
  - **Correlate Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs, particularly the file event logs, to determine if the specified `osksupport.dll` file anomaly occurred. Specifically, analyze logs for file creations or modifications in the `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\` folder.
  - **Examine the Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to inspect any outbound network connections initiated by `osk.exe` or related processes. Check for any unusual or unauthorized domains that the processes may be trying to communicate with.
  - **Conduct File Analysis:** If `osksupport.dll` is detected, perform an in-depth analysis using antivirus or other file analysis tools to determine whether itâ€™s a known malicious file. Ensure to check its file hash against threat intelligence sources.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the UAC Bypass technique allows attackers to elevate privileges silently, the alert carries a high severity level, warranting prompt attention from SOC analysts. A successful exploit of this nature could lead to significant breaches of sensitive systems or data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where file event monitoring is disabled or if the attack is performed with custom file paths not specified by the detection logic. It also assumes that the naming conventions for legitimate files and processes remain consistent and that appropriate permissions are in place for monitoring file events effectively. Additionally, advanced adversaries may employ obfuscation or alternate techniques to bypass detection, rendering this rule ineffective.

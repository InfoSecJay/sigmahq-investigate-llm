  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting the HackTool 
  - RemoteKrbRelay SMB Relay Secrets Dump Module Indicators functions by identifying the creation of specific temporary files that are commonly utilized during a RemoteKrbRelay SMB Relay attack. These files, named `sam.tmp`, `sec.tmp`, and `sys.tmp`, are created in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory when an attacker attempts to dump sensitive information from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database. The rule analyzes file events within the Windows environment to capture the creation of these suspicious files. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique of Command and Control (T1219), highlighting the threat posed by adversaries leveraging SMB relay attacks to compromise credentials and gain unauthorized access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze File Events**: Use your SIEM to search for file creation events corresponding to `sam.tmp`, `sec.tmp`, and `sys.tmp` in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory. Cross-reference these with the timestamps of user activity to identify inconsistent or unauthorized file creations.
    
  - **Examine Process Creation**: Investigate the processes that triggered the file creation events. Utilize your EDR to analyze the command-line parameters, parent-child process relationships, and any unusual parent processes that might indicate malicious activity.
  - **Assess User Activity**: Review Windows Security logs to determine the user context under which the file creation occurred. Check for any accounts that exhibited suspicious behavior leading up to the file creation events.
  - **Monitor Network Connections**: Look into network logs for any suspicious SMB traffic that correlates with the file creation events. Pay special attention to outgoing connections that may indicate the exfiltration of credentials or other sensitive data.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential implications of a successful SMB relay attack, which can lead to credential harvesting and significant security breaches within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger under certain conditions, such as if the filenames are changed by an adversary to avoid detection or if alternative dumping methods are utilized that do not involve file creation in the specified directory. Additionally, there may be legitimate processes that inadvertently generate these files, which could result in false positives. Assumptions also include that necessary event logging is enabled on endpoints; if logging is insufficient, the rule may fail to detect these events.

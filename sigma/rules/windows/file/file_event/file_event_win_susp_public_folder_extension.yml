  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Binaries and Scripts in Public Folder" detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activity by monitoring file creation events within the Public folder of Windows systems. Specifically, it focuses on files with suspicious extensions such as `.bat`, `.dll`, `.exe`, `.hta`, `.js`, `.ps1`, `.vbe`, and `.vbs`. The rule leverages Windows file event logs to capture details about these files as they're created, especially in a location often accessible by multiple users, which can pose a security risk. The detection is built around the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (T1204), which encompasses various methods adversaries use to execute their malicious payloads. By detecting unexpected files with these extensions, security teams can more readily respond to potential threats and anomalies within the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Context**: Utilize EDR or file event logs to identify when and how the suspicious file was created, noting the user account and the application that initiated the creation process.
  - **Assess File Origin and Behavior**: Retrieve additional details about the suspicious file using tools like VirusTotal or your organizationâ€™s AV/EDR to evaluate if the file has a history of being flagged as malicious.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Examine Windows Security logs to investigate the user sessions around the time of file creation, analyzing login history to determine if any unauthorized access occurred.
  - **Monitor for Subsequent Actions**: Check for any further actions associated with the suspicious file, such as execution or modification events, which could indicate whether it was utilized maliciously.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity level because the creation of executable or script files in a commonly accessible location can lead to rapid exploitation of the environment. This is particularly concerning as it provides an opportunity for adversaries to execute code on targeted systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if an adversary uses obfuscation techniques to bypass standard extensions or if legitimate administrative activities involve deploying files to the Public folder. Additionally, if the alert criteria are altered by a threat actor, such as by renaming files with non-suspicious extensions, the rule may not trigger. It's assumed that not all legitimate activities are accounted for in false positive scenarios, such as administrative tasks.

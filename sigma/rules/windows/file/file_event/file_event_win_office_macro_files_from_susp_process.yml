  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying instances where malicious Office macro files are created from suspicious processes. It examines process creation events to find parent-child relationships between specific potentially harmful scripting engines (such as `cscript.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `wscript.exe`) and the creation of Office macro file formats (including `.docm`, `.dotm`, `.xlsm`, `.xltm`, `.potm`, and `.pptm`). The detection is reliant on the Sysmon logs, specifically Event ID 11, which captures process creation information. However, to achieve its full functionality, it's important to ensure that Sysmon logs are enriched with the ParentImage data, as it is not enabled by default. This rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Initial Access (T1566.001 
  - Phishing: Malicious File).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check for entries in Sysmon logs for the involved suspicious processes (`cscript.exe`, `mshta.exe`, etc.) to understand the 
  - context of their execution and any command-line parameters that were used.
    
  - **Analyze Parent-Child Relationships:** Use EDR tools to investigate the parent process of the Office macro file creation event, determining whether it was initiated by one of the identified suspicious scripts or executables.
  - **Examine File Creation Events:** Look for relevant file creation events in Windows Security logs to confirm the timestamp and details of the created Office macro files.
  - **Query Network Activity:** Utilize network logs to assess any outbound connection attempts from the suspicious processes that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it warrants prompt attention as it indicates a potential initial access vector that could lead to further compromise if a malicious actor is creating and executing macros within Office documents.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious process does not utilize the targeted suspicious executables or if it employs a different method for macro creation that evades detection. Additionally, if Sysmon logging has not been configured to capture ParentImage data, this correlation will be ineffective. Furthermore, it is assumed that telemetry is enabled for the covered file types and that malicious activity may utilize obfuscation techniques to hide its presence.

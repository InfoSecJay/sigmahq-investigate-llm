  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potential bypass attempts of application whitelisting controls through the exploitation of Windows Remote Management (WinRM) using attacker-controlled XSL files, specifically `WsmPty.xsl` and `WsmTxt.xsl`. The rule inspects file creation events to identify instances where these files are executed outside of their expected directories (`C:\Windows\System32\` and `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\`). By looking for these files in unauthorized locations, the rule highlights potentially malicious activity as adversaries may use `winrm.vbs` along with copied or renamed instances of `cscript.exe` to execute unauthorized code. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1216, which addresses the evasion of application whitelisting measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Execution Path:** Use EDR or Sysmon logs to investigate the execution path of `WsmPty.xsl` and `WsmTxt.xsl` to confirm if they were executed from a non-standard directory. 
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Review process creation logs for any instances of `cscript.exe` that coincide with the execution of the suspicious XSL files to trace back to the initial command line parameters used.
  - **Review WinRM Activity:** Investigate the Windows Event Logs related to WinRM (Event ID 4104) to identify any anomalous remote management activity that may correlate with the detection alert.
  - **Assess Endpoint Security Alerts:** Coordinate with AV or EDR tools to analyze if any security alerts triggered during the time of the execution to gather further insights on the scope and impact of the potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the nature of the detection, indicating potential evasion of application whitelisting which could lead to unauthorized execution of malicious code on endpoints within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker has already gained trusted access to use legitimate tools or if the malicious XSL files are executed from a whitelisted directory. Additionally, the efficiency of this detection is contingent on the appropriate logging being enabled and retained in the Windows environment, specifically Sysmon for file events. It also assumes that the attacker does not alter the naming conventions of the scripts or employ other stealth techniques to mask malicious file activity.

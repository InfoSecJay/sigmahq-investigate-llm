  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "HackTool 
  - Inveigh Execution Artefacts" is designed to detect potential malicious activity associated with Inveigh, a tool often used for intercepting and relaying network authentication protocols, particularly NTLM. This detection is triggered when specific artefacts related to Inveigh are identified in file events. The rule searches for files that are characteristic of Inveigh's operations, such as log files (`Inveigh-Log.txt`, `Inveigh-Cleartext.txt`), user lists (`Inveigh-NTLMv1Users.txt`, `Inveigh-NTLMv2Users.txt`), and executable scripts (`Inveigh.exe`, `Inveigh.ps1`). The relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques tied to this detection involve command and control (T1219), highlighting the risk posed by these tools in an attacker's arsenal. By monitoring file events that indicate the presence and operation of Inveigh, security teams can identify potential misuse and mitigate threats before they escalate into more significant incidents.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze File Events:** Review the identified file events in the Windows Security logs to trace the creation and execution of the Inveigh-related files. Confirm if these files were created by legitimate processes or if they are associated with suspicious activity.
  - **Check Process Listings:** Utilize EDR tools to inspect the active processes on affected hosts for any instances of `Inveigh.exe` or other related scripts. Ensure that these processes are not running in unexpected contexts or locations.
  - **Network Traffic Evaluation:** Use NDR tools to analyze outbound network traffic from the affected machine for any suspicious connections, especially those initiating NTLM authentication requests. Look for unusual communication patterns indicative of a man-in-the-middle attack.
  - **Review User Activity:** Cross-reference user activity logs to identify any unauthorized or anomalous login attempts that coincide with the detection of Inveigh artefacts. Highlight any accounts that may have been targeted or compromised.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as critical due to the significant risk associated with tools like Inveigh, which can facilitate unauthorized access and credential harvesting, potentially leading to wider network compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if Inveigh artefacts are handled or named differently, or if the files are created and executed with techniques designed to evade detection. Additionally, environments with custom scripts or legitimate applications that may create similarly named files could generate false negatives. Itâ€™s essential for detection engineers to consider the variety of ways malicious actors might obfuscate their actions to bypass such monitoring.

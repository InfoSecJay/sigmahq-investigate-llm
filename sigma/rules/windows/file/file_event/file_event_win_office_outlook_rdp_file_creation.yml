  Detects the creation of files with the ".rdp" extensions in the temporary directory that Outlook uses when opening attachments.
  This can be used to detect spear-phishing campaigns that use RDP files as attachments.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect when files with the ".rdp" extension are created within the temporary directories utilized by Microsoft Outlook, particularly when handling email attachments. The presence of such files can often signal malicious activities, especially in the context of spear-phishing campaigns, where attackers may leverage RDP files to enable remote connections to compromised systems. The rule specifically looks for the creation of RDP files in locations associated with Outlook, including various paths under the AppData directory for Microsoft Outlook. 
  When invoked, this rule monitors file events, focusing on the `TargetFilename` parameter to identify any instances where the file path contains specific Outlook-related directories and ends with the ".rdp" extension. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Defense Evasion**, as threat actors may use such techniques to disguise their malicious intent within seemingly benign email communications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Event Logs:** Initiate a review of the endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs on the affected hosts to identify the context of the Outlook process that created the ".rdp" file and any associated processes that were active at that time.
  - **Analyze File Metadata:** Investigate the properties of the created ".rdp" file, including the user who created it, the time of creation, and any subsequent access or modification that may provide clues about its use or intent.
  - **Review Outlook Activity:** Examine Outlook logs or perform a search on the email attachments within the timeframe of the alert to correlate the specific email(s) from which the RDP file originated, identifying potential phishing attempts.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Utilize network detection and response (NDR) tools to analyze any anomalies in outbound connections or traffic related to the IP address specified in the RDP file, confirming whether it was used to establish a remote session.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of an RDP file being created through Outlook, which may indicate a successful phishing attempt. If exploited, such files can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where users legitimately receive and handle RDP files without malicious intent, such as in response to legitimate business needs. Additionally, users might have automated processes to handle such files, resulting in normal usage patterns that could avoid detection. It assumes that Outlook is the primary email client being used; in environments with different clients or older versions of Outlook, this rule may fail to trigger. Lastly, if an adversary uses an RDP file created through non-Outlook channels or manipulates the original file before delivery, this detection may also be evaded.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) in Windows using NTFS reparse points and DLL hijacking via the `wusa.exe` process. The rule specifically looks for file events where the target filename starts with `C:\Users\` and ends with `\AppData\Local\Temp\api-ms-win-core-kernel32-legacy-l1.DLL`. The targeted use of this malicious DLL in the Local Temp directory is indicative of an attacker trying to exploit the way Windows loads dynamic link libraries, allowing them to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The technical data sources involved in this detection include file system events logged by Windows, particularly those captured in the context of the file access by the `wusa.exe` process. This detection corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques focused on defense evasion and privilege escalation, specifically T1548.002.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Events:** Check the file event logs in your SIEM to identify access attempts to the specified DLL within the `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp` directory.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to search for instances of `wusa.exe` running around the same time as the detected file events, which may indicate an attempted UAC bypass.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Examine network connection logs, especially if there were any external connections made by `wusa.exe` that could indicate command and control activity.
  - **Check for Other Indicators:** Review Sysmon logs, looking particularly for unusual process tree executions or other anomalous behaviors associated with user account modifications or privilege escalations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as high severity due to the potential for severe impact to the enterprise environment, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems through privilege escalation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious DLL is renamed or if the UAC bypass is executed through a different method or without using the `wusa.exe` process. Additionally, if the file access logging is misconfigured or not capturing the relevant events, the detection may fail. Analysts should also consider the possibility of legitimate applications that could inadvertently generate similar file events, leading to false positives.

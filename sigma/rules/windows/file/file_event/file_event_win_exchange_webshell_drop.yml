  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the dropping of suspicious ASPX files by the Microsoft Exchange component running under the IIS web server. The rule focuses on monitoring Windows file events, specifically looking for instances where the process `w3wp.exe` (IIS worker process) uses `MSExchange` in the command line to store these files in specific directories commonly associated with malicious activity, such as `FrontEnd\HttpProxy\` and `\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\`. By targeting file types like ASPX, ASP, and ASHX, the rule aims to catch potentially harmful web applications that could be exploited during a persistent threat scenario. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence and specifically targets ATT&CK technique T1505.003, which focuses on exploiting web servers to maintain access. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate File Creation Events:** Check the filesystem for newly created or modified files in the directories mentioned in the rule (`FrontEnd\HttpProxy\`, `\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\`) around the time of the alert. Use Sysmon logs or file event logs to track file activity.
  - **Review Process Command Lines:** Utilize EDR tools to review command-line arguments for the `w3wp.exe` process to confirm if it includes `MSExchange` and check for any unusual parameters that might indicate exploitation.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Examine network connections associated with the identified processes for any unusual outbound requests or communications with known malicious domains. Use NDR and proxy logs to correlate suspicious activity.
  - **Cross-reference Event Logs:** Check Windows Security and System event logs for any user credential activity around the time of the alert. Look for unusual login attempts or privilege escalation that could indicate a compromise of the Exchange environment.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of malicious ASPX file execution on a web server, which could lead to further persistence and lateral movement within the network. Responding promptly to this alert is critical to prevent exploitation of the Exchange server.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule relies on correct logging configurations in the Windows environment; if logs from Sysmon or other relevant sources are not being captured or are misconfigured, this rule may not trigger. Additionally, if an adversary modifies the default file drop locations or obfuscates command lines, this rule might fail to identify the activity. Furthermore, the use of legitimate file types for malicious purposes could evade detection, meaning that context surrounding file behavior needs to be closely monitored in conjunction with this rule.

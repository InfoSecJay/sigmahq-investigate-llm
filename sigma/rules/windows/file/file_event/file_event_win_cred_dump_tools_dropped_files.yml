  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the creation of files associated with credential dumping toolsâ€”a common tactic employed by attackers to harvest sensitive authentication information from systems. It specifically looks for filenames that are indicative of such tools or the output files they generate, including 'fgdump-log', 'pwdump', and 'NTDS.out'. To monitor this behavior, the rule leverages Windows File Event Logs to track the creation and modification of files that match specific naming patterns. By identifying these suspicious file activities, organizations can proactively respond to potential credential harvesting attempts, which align with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1003.001 (Credential Dumping: Local Files), T1003.002 (Credential Dumping: Credentials from LSASS), T1003.003 (Credential Dumping: NTDS), and others under the credential-access tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Events:** Check Windows File Event logs for entries matching the suspicious filenames in the rule to establish the timeline of the file creation.
  - **Correlate with Process Logs:** Utilize EDR to examine process creation logs around the same time the suspicious files were created to identify if a credential dumping tool was executed.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Analyze user activity logs (e.g., from VPN or Proxy) to verify whether legitimate administrative activities correspond to the file creations or if there are anomalies.
  - **Check for Malicious Patterns:** Search for known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to credential dumping within EDR and AV systems to see if the environment has been previously targeted.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of credential harvesting attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The detection may not trigger if attackers use non-standard filenames or modify the default file paths associated with credential dumping tools to evade detection. Additionally, the rule assumes that file creation events are logged appropriately, and any log configuration issues could prevent detection. Another consideration is that legitimate administrators performing password recovery activities might inadvertently trigger the alert, leading to false positives.

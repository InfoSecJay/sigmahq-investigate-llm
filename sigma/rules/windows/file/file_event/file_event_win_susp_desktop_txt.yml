  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious file creation activity on Windows systems, specifically targeting .txt files created on user desktops. The rule focuses on identifying the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) as the process responsible for the creation of these files, which is often indicative of ransomware behavior, such as creating ransom notes. The targeted file path is specified to be within the user’s desktop directory, where malicious files are commonly dropped to capture user attention. The primary data source for this rule is file event logs from Windows, which provide insights into file creation actions, including the process responsible and the specific target filename.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact, which highlights how adversaries may leverage file creation to inflict damage by disrupting access to vital information or leaving ransom notes. Analysts should remain vigilant for this activity as it may indicate a broader compromise or operational threat in the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the Windows Security logs to identify instances of `cmd.exe` in proximity to the file creation event. Correlate the timestamps to confirm if the command prompt was used to create the file.
  - **Analyze Created File:** Check the content of the .txt file created on the desktop. Look for typical ransom note patterns and identify any unique strings or phrases that may assist in understanding the nature of the activity.
  - **Check User Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the actions of the user whose desktop file was created. Investigate their recent logins, application usage, and any potentially suspicious activities around the time of the incident.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Inspect network connection logs for any outbound connections that coincide with the time of the file creation. Pay special attention to connections to known malicious IPs or domains that may indicate communication with a Command and Control (C2) server.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high level of the alert, the creation of a suspicious .txt file on a user’s desktop is a significant indicator of potential ransomware activity. In an enterprise environment, this requires immediate attention as it may suggest an ongoing attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where the adversary uses alternative methods for file creation that do not involve `cmd.exe`, such as utilizing other scripting languages or applications. Additionally, if file activity is masked using encryption or if logs are cleared by the attacker, detection may fail. The assumption here is that investigation may not reveal a comprehensive picture of user actions if dwell time is long or if lateral movement occurred without trace.

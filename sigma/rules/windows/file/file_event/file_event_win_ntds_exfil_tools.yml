  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential file exfiltration events related to the NTDS (NT Directory Services) in Windows environments. Specifically, it looks for file creation events involving filenames that match certain patterns commonly associated with tools used to export the NTDS.DIT file. The targeted filenames include `All.cab` and `.ntds.cleartext`, both of which have been tied to post-exploitation activities utilizing tools such as Metasploit and Impacket. By analyzing Windows file event logs, particularly focusing on file creation activities, the rule aims to detect behaviors indicative of unauthorized access and extraction of sensitive directory data, which fall under the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Credential Access" tactic (T1003.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Creation Logs:** Review Windows Security logs for file creation events with the specified target filenames. Look for unusual timestamps or file creation locations that may indicate exfiltration attempts.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Analyze EDR logs to identify processes that triggered these file creation events. Investigate the parent processes for signs of malicious activity or known exploitation tools.
    
  - **Network Activity Review:** Utilize network logs to search for outbound connections made by the processes that created the flagged filenames. Verify if any unauthorized data transfers occurred during the timeframe of the file creation.
    
  - **Examine User Accounts and Permissions:** Review user account access logs to check if the actions originated from accounts with appropriate permissions. Look for anomalies in user behavior, especially from accounts that shouldn't have direct access to NTDS data.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the sensitive nature of the NTDS data, which includes user credentials and other valuable information. The exfiltration of such data poses significant risks to the organization, including potential data breaches and unauthorized access to systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where the file creation activity is blocked or altered by security solutions prior to logging, or if the malicious users employ different filename patterns that are not covered by this detection. Additionally, if the exfiltration occurs through alternative methods that bypass traditional file systems, such as using memory-based techniques or file-less malware, the rule will likely fail to detect those activities. It's essential for other engineers to understand that proactive measures need to be in place to monitor for deviations in user behavior and unexpected network traffic patterns that could indicate attempts at data exfiltration.

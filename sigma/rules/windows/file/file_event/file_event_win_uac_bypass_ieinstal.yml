  ### Technical Context
  The UAC Bypass Using IEInstal rule is designed to detect an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) protections on Windows systems by utilizing the application `IEInstal.exe`. This rule specifically looks for scenarios where the `IEInstal.exe` process is used to create a file named `consent.exe` in a userâ€™s local AppData Temp directory, which is a common tactic employed by attackers to escalate privileges without alerting security measures. The primary data sources involved in this detection include file event logs indicating process creation and file manipulation activities. This behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for "Exploitation for Client Execution" (T1548.002), falling under the broader tactics of "Defense Evasion" and "Privilege Escalation."
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check for alerts related to the process creation of `IEInstal.exe` and subsequent file activities within the `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory, focusing on `consent.exe` files.
  - **Analyze File Integrity:** Utilize file integrity monitoring to verify the legitimacy of the `IEInstal.exe` executable and the circumstances that led to the creation of any suspicious files.
  - **Inspect User Activity:** Examine user activity logs for any unauthorized access patterns or attempts to disable UAC settings prior to the detection event. 
  - **Investigate Network Connections:** Verify recent outbound connections from the user's machine to identify any associated command and control (C2) communications linked to this alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to its association with privilege escalation tactics that can lead to significant compromise of user systems and potential access to sensitive corporate resources.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where the `IEInstal.exe` executable is not present or allowed in normal operations. Additionally, it assumes that the file naming convention has not been altered by attackers to evade detection. A determined adversary might employ alternative methods or legitimate administrative tools to bypass UAC, which this rule does not account for.

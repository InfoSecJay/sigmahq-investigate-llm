  ### Technical Context
  The Octopus Scanner Malware detection rule identifies malicious activities associated with a specific piece of malware known as Octopus Scanner. It focuses on monitoring file events generated on Windows systems, specifically looking for the presence of certain files that are indicative of this malware's operation. The rule is designed to detect file activities related to `Cache134.dat` and `ExplorerSync.db`, which are commonly utilized by the malware to store and manage stolen data. It leverages logs generated by file events, enabling security analysts to pinpoint unauthorized file changes that may signify a compromise.
  This rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for "Credential Access" (TA0006) and the technique "Credential Dumping" (T1195), which outlines strategies for adversaries to gather account credentials. By detecting file event changes tied to malicious artifacts, security teams can investigate and mitigate the impacts of this type of malware in their environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate the Alert:** Review the triggering file events in your SIEM or EDR to confirm the presence of `Cache134.dat` or `ExplorerSync.db` files. Check for multiple instances of modification or creation timestamps to ascertain potential malicious behavior.
  - **Analyze File Properties:** Utilize tools like Sysinternals' File Explorer or PowerShell commands to inspect properties and metadata of the identified files. Look for anomalies such as unusual file size, creation history, or any signs of suspicious conduct.
  - **Check Process Activity:** Investigate related process creation logs for any executables that interacted with the detected files. Correlate these with other indicators of compromise such as command-line arguments often associated with malware behavior.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Examine network logs for any connections initiated by the processes found associated with the malicious files. Monitor for suspicious outbound traffic that might indicate data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity primarily due to the critical nature of credential access techniques and the potential impact of Octopus Scanner on an organizationâ€™s security posture. Quick identification and remediation can prevent significant data breaches and further compromise within the network.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  Some of the recognized blind spots include scenarios where the alert may not fire if the malware uses different file names or locations that are not accounted for in the rule. Additionally, if the files are obfuscated or deleted before detection, the rule may fail to capture these indicators. It is assumed that relevant logs for file events are being appropriately collected and stored within the designated timeframe; if logging is misconfigured or lacking, crucial evidence may not be available for this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of files named "WerFault.exe" or "wer.dll" in uncommon directories. Typically, these files are legitimate components associated with Windows Error Reporting, which is used to troubleshoot and report issues within the OS. By monitoring file creation activities, particularly in locations that do not align with standard Windows paths (such as `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\`, `C:\Windows\System32\`, `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\`, and `C:\Windows\WinSxS\`), the rule can effectively highlight potential DLL hijacking attempts. Attackers may exploit this method to introduce malicious payloads under the guise of legitimate Windows processes. The rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactics of persistence and defense evasion, specifically targeting technique T1574.001 (DLL Search Order Hijacking).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check the Windows Security and Sysmon event logs for file creation events related to "WerFault.exe" and "wer.dll," noting the timestamp and user context of the actions.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize EDR solutions to examine any related alerts around the same time as the file creation event; look for anomalous process activities that may indicate compromise.
  - **Search for Related Artifacts:** Look for additional suspicious files or event logs that may correlate with the unusual folder; consider examining process parent-child relationships to identify any malicious execution chain.
  - **Investigate Network Connections:** Use proxy and network traffic logs to search for any unusual outbound connections originating from the detected processes, which may indicate communication with a command-and-control server.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be considered medium severity, as the creation of “WerFault.exe” or “wer.dll” in unconventional directories typically indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Prompt investigation is crucial to determine if it signifies a potential compromise of the system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where legitimate applications modify these files in unusual directories without following standard practices. Additionally, if an attacker is proficient, they may delete or obfuscate the malicious files prior to detection or utilize process injection techniques that do not involve file creation. It's essential for detection engineers to remain aware of evolving tactics used by adversaries which may evade such detection mechanisms.

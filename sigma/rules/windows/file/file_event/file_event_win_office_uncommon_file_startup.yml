  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of files with uncommon extensions within Microsoft Office application startup folders. Specifically, it focuses on the `STARTUP` directory for Microsoft Word and Excel, both located in the standard Office installation paths. The rule looks for file events where a newly created file doesn't match common Office document extensions, such as `.docx` or `.xlsx`, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as the execution of unauthorized macros or scripts. The detection mechanism utilizes file event logs from Windows to monitor the creation of files and checks them against predefined criteria regarding their locations and extensions.
  By ensuring that only files with uncommon extensions trigger alerts, responders can effectively filter out benign activity while focusing on incidents that may warrant further investigation. This rule is particularly important in a corporate environment where Office file formats are ubiquitous, and any unusual behavior within these application startup folders can be indicative of an attempt to leverage Office software for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review file creation events in the companyâ€™s EDR solution to identify the specific process that created the uncommon file and its associated command-line parameters.
  - Check the logs of Microsoft Office applications in use to determine if the detected file was accessed or executed, which could suggest further malicious activity.
  - Analyze the context around the file creation by correlating events within the SIEM to identify any suspicious user behavior or relationships between multiple alerts involving the same user.
  - Investigate the network activity using NDR logs to see if any known files or domains associated with malicious Office exploits were contacted following the creation of the file.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the creation of files with uncommon extensions in the startup folders of Microsoft Office applications, specifically Word and Excel. The rule monitors specific file paths, such as `\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP` and `\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART`, and employs a set of exclusion criteria to filter out common file types, such as `.docx` for Word and `.xlsx` for Excel. By focusing on the creation of files that do not belong to the standard set of extensions used by these applications, the rule aims to detect potential malignant activity that may be indicative of resource development (T1587.001) by attackers, as they may utilize unusual file types to evade detection.
  The underlying telemetry for this rule leverages Windows file event logs. The condition captures a file creation event if it occurs in the specified Office startup directories and has an uncommon file extension that does not match the pre-defined exclusions. This methodology aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics concerning resource development, where adversaries may attempt to drop or execute malicious payloads through leveraging trusted application folders.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the alert source:** Check the Windows file event logs for any file creation events that triggered this rule. Confirm the file path and extension against the rule's criteria.
  - **Analyze the file content:** If an alert is generated, analyze the content of the created file using an EDR solution. Look for malicious indicators, such as scripts or unexpected payloads.
  - **Review user context:** Investigate the account that created the file to determine if it has a legitimate purpose or if it was accessed by a potentially compromised user account. Correlate with other logs for abnormal behavior.
  - **Assess system impact:** Conduct a broader assessment within the environment using your EDR or AV tools to check if any further malicious activities are linked to the file creation or if similar alerts have occurred elsewhere.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a high severity level due to its focus on file creations in trusted directories, which is a common behavior exhibited during the early stages of an attack, such as installing persistence mechanisms. Any occurrence of uncommon file types can indicate an immediate need for investigation to mitigate potential threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses common file extensions that are excluded in the filter, such as standard Office document types. Furthermore, if the attack employs indirect methods, such as bypassing the startup folder or using legitimate applications in an unintended way, the rule may also remain silent. It assumes that the monitored paths are standard configurations, which may not hold true in all environments, especially with custom Office setups or organizational policy deviations.

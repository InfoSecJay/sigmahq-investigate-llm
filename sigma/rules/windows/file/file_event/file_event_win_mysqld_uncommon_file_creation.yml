status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the creation of files with scripting or executable extensions by Mysql daemon.
  Which could be an indicator of "User Defined Functions" abuse to download malware.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies potentially malicious behavior stemming from the MySQL daemon process (mysqld.exe) that creates files with specific scripting or executable extensions. The detection is premised on the understanding that an adversary may exploit User Defined Functions (UDFs) within MySQL to execute or download malicious payloads, thereby bypassing traditional security measures. The logging sources utilized for this detection include Windows file event logs capturing file creation activities, specifically monitoring the MySQL daemon's behavior for the creation of files with extensions like .bat, .dll, .exe, .ps1, and others. By correlating these events with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for "Defense Evasion," specifically the use of UDFs, analysts can better understand the tactics employed by attackers aiming to craft effective exploits or maintain persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Logs:** Investigate the relevant file creation events in the Windows Security logs, focusing on entries from the MySQL daemon's process ID to confirm the creation of any suspicious files.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Use EDR tools to investigate the MySQL daemon's behavior around the time of the file creation, checking for unusual command-line arguments or processes spawned that may indicate exploitation.
  - **Check for Known Threat Indicators:** Query any external threat intelligence feeds for the identified file names or associated hashes, confirming whether any of them are known malware.
  - **Collect Sample Files:** If suspicious files are found, collect them for further analysis, including using antivirus tools and malware sandboxes to determine their nature and potential impact.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the potential risk of malware installation and exploitation of the MySQL service, which can compromise entire systems or networks. Immediate investigation is necessary to mitigate any potential breach resulting from this activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where MySQL is not utilized or misconfigured, leading to missed detections of malicious activities. Additionally, attackers may use alternative processes or benign-looking file names to carry out similar activities, thus evading detection. Assumptions include that the MySQL daemon is running with standard permissions and that file creation events are being logged adequately; any deviation may lead to gaps in detection.

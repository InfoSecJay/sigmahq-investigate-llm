  ### Technical Context
  The "Office Macro File Creation" detection rule monitors for the creation of Office macro files, which can be a vector for malware delivery and exploitation. Specifically, this rule looks for file events where the target filenames end with specific extensions associated with macro-enabled documents such as `.docm`, `.xlsm`, `.pptm`, and others. These extensions signify that the files may contain macros, which can execute commands automatically when opened. The rule utilizes Windows file event logs to capture the activities surrounding file creation, focusing particularly on macro-enabled documents that could be leveraged for malicious purposes. The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic is "Initial Access," specifically technique T1566.001, which covers malicious email attachments as a vector for threat actors to penetrate an organization.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Creation Logs:** Investigate the creation events of macro-enabled files in the relevant directories using Windows Security logs to understand the context and possible sources of the files.
  - **Review User Interaction:** Use EDR to analyze user interactions with these macro files, including any suspicious execution paths or behavioral anomalies that could indicate exploitation attempts.
  - **Correlate with Email Traffic:** Cross-reference email logs in the organizationâ€™s email gateway or proxy with the timestamps of file creation to identify any potentially malicious attachments that were delivered shortly before the detection.
  - **Assess Preceding Activities:** Examine the process creation and execution logs around the time the macro files were created to identify any unusual activity or known malicious processes that might have attempted to exploit these files.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a low severity level as the creation of macro-enabled files is a common occurrence in many business environments. However, it is critical to assess the context of these files, as they could present a risk if created in unusual circumstances.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if macro files are created under legitimate workflows, especially in environments where these files are standard practice. Additionally, if an adversary uses a different method to create these files or if the necessary Windows event logging is not enabled, detection will be limited. It is also assumed that macro files are not being created through administrative or system-level processes which may not be logged in the same way.

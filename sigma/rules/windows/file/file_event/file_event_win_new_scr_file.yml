title: SCR File Write Event
id: c048f047-7e2a-4888-b302-55f509d4a91d
status: test
description: Detects the creation of screensaver files (.scr) outside of system folders.
  Attackers may execute an application as an ".SCR" file using "rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver"
  for example.

  ### Technical Context
  The "SCR File Write Event" detection rule monitors for the creation of screensaver files with a ".scr" extension outside of designated system folders on Windows systems. Attackers may leverage screensaver files to execute arbitrary code, often using the command `rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver`, which can lead to unauthorized access and defense evasion techniques as documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011. The rule analyzes file event logs, specifically looking for instances where target filenames end with ".scr" and excluding those created in system directories such as `C:\Windows\System32` and other protected system paths. By focusing on file creation events, this rule aids in identifying potential malicious activity that could go unnoticed in typical user workflows.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs:** Examine Endpoint Detection and Response logs for recent file activity, specifically related to ".scr" files, to determine if the file was executed or if any associated processes were initiated.
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Investigate process creation events linked to the observed ".scr" file, focusing on any command lines that include `rundll32.exe` or other suspicious executables that may indicate exploitation.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Use network detection tools to inspect outbound connections initiated by the processes corresponding to the ".scr" file, identifying any communications that may suggest exfiltration or coordination with external malicious actors.
  - **Correlate with User Activity Logs:** Cross-reference the file creation event with user activity logs to discern whether the action correlates with legitimate user behavior or if it appears to be anomalous or unauthorized.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for a successful exploitation via executable screensaver files, which could compromise endpoint security and facilitate further attacker movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses other methods to create ".scr" files directly in the monitored paths, if they rename non-executable files to ".scr," or utilize techniques to delete logs before detection. Additionally, the rule assumes that the proper telemetry is enabled and that no other security software interferes with file monitoring or event logging. It's essential to consider that legitimate applications or user actions may generate alerts, necessitating thorough investigation to avoid false positives.

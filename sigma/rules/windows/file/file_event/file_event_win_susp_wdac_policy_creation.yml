title: Potentially Suspicious WDAC Policy File Creation
id: 1d2de8a6-4803-4fde-b85b-f58f3aa7a705
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects suspicious Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy file creation from abnormal processes that could be abused by attacker to block EDR/AV components while allowing their own malicious code to run on the system.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Potentially Suspicious WDAC Policy File Creation" detection rule aims to identify anomalous file creation events associated with Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies. This rule focuses on the detection of unauthorized or abnormal processes attempting to create WDAC policy files within the "\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity\" directory. Such file creations can indicate attempts by malicious actors to block legitimate EDR/AV components, potentially allowing harmful code to execute without detection. The primary technical data sources for this rule include file event logs that capture file creation in the specified directory, process and command-line parameters, particularly from PowerShell or other scripting tools, and filtering out legitimate processes known to manage WDAC for normal operations. This detection ties closely to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion and the associated technique of “Indicator Removal on Host (T1070).”
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Source Process:** Investigate the process that triggered the file creation alert using EDR data. Confirm whether this process has legitimate reasons to perform operations within the specified directory.
  - **Analyze Command Line:** Review the command-line arguments associated with the process. Specifically, look for usage of commands such as `ConvertFrom-CIPolicy`, `CiTool --update-policy`, or any suspicious PowerShell commands that may indicate misuse.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference the file event logs with Windows Security logs to check for any anomalous user logins or privilege escalations that corresponded with the timing of the alert.
  - **Assess Environment Context:** Review any group policy changes, recent WDAC policy updates, or legitimate administrative actions that were performed around the timestamp of the suspicious event, as these may provide context to the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because while suspicious file creation is serious, the presence of legitimate administrative activities can often lead to false positives. However, a confirmed detection should invoke further investigation due to the potential implications of bypassing security controls.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that only abnormal processes will attempt to create files in the specified directory. It may not fire in scenarios where legitimate administrative tools are misused, or if threat actors leverage techniques to obfuscate their activities, such as using non-standard paths or processes to create the files. Additionally, if the WDAC configurations or group policies are misconfigured or overly permissive, these activities may go undetected. Further, reliance on specific command-line patterns may lead to rule evasion if adversaries use alternative commands or scripts that do not match the defined contingencies.

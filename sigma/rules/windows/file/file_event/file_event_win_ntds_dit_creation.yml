  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "NTDS.DIT Created" is designed to detect the creation of a file named "ntds.dit," which corresponds to the Active Directory database associated with Windows Server environments. The creation of this file could indicate unauthorized access or manipulation of Active Directory, potentially setting the stage for further attacks such as credential dumping or privilege escalation. The rule primarily focuses on file creation events that specifically target this filename, leveraging data sources that capture file system events on Windows endpoints.
  The detection mechanism involves monitoring file events that report on the creation of files within the operating system. In this context, enterprise logging tools, such as Windows Security, are crucial as they track file-related activities and provide valuable insights into potentially malicious behavior. The rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Credential Access" tactic and specifically the technique T1003.003, which targets the extraction or manipulation of sensitive credential material stored in the Active Directory database. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Logs:** Check file creation logs in Windows Security or EDR tools for the "ntds.dit" file creation event. Take note of the time and user context to determine if it aligns with any legitimate administrative activities.
  - **Inspect Process Creation Events:** Use Sysmon or EDR to determine the processes that were active at the time of the file creation. Look for suspicious or unexpected processes that may indicate an unauthorized access attempt to the system.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Investigate the account that initiated the file creation for any unusual login activity or anomalies within user behavior patterns. Cross-reference against known administrative accounts and their activities.
  - **Query Network Activities:** Examine network connection logs from NGFW or Proxy to identify any abnormal traffic patterns that coincide with the file creation event. Pay special attention to any outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is classified as low; however, it warrants timely investigation due to the potential implications related to credential access and integrity of Active Directory data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where auditing is improperly configured, or when "ntds.dit" is created in a legitimate anomaly during maintenance activities. Additionally, attackers may employ techniques that obscure or rename the executable responsible for file creation, evading detection. Itâ€™s also possible that certain security settings prevent log retention or visibility into the event logs required for the rule to function effectively.

title: Suspicious Binary Writes Via AnyDesk
id: 2d367498-5112-4ae5-a06a-96e7bc33a211
status: test
description: |
  Detects AnyDesk writing binary files to disk other than "gcapi.dll".
  According to RedCanary research it is highly abnormal for AnyDesk to write executable files to disk besides gcapi.dll,
  which is a legitimate DLL that is part of the Google Chrome web browser used to interact with the Google Cloud API. (See reference section for more details)

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect suspicious binary writes to disk by AnyDesk, a remote desktop application. It specifically looks for instances where AnyDesk (identified by its executable name, e.g., `AnyDesk.exe` or `AnyDeskMSI.exe`) writes executable files (.exe) or dynamic link libraries (.dll) to the disk, with the exception of `gcapi.dll`. The rule leverages file event logs that capture file creation actions, specifically monitoring the `TargetFilename` for executable file extensions. Executable files and additional DLLs beyond the expected `gcapi.dll` can indicate malicious behavior, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Command and Control (T1219). In this context, the presence of unusual file writes can suggest potential compromise or misuse of the AnyDesk application by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify AnyDesk Activity:** Check the EDR for AnyDesk activity in conjunction with the file creation events. Look for any unauthorized executable or DLL files and review their source and purpose.
    
  - **Review File Origin:** Investigate the origin of the suspicious files written to disk. Utilize the file path and hash values to determine if these files are part of a known malicious file or artifact.
  - **Audit User Accounts:** Analyze user account activity associated with the binary write events. Verify whether the user has legitimate reasons to use AnyDesk and check historical access logs for anomalies.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Examine network logs for AnyDesk-related connections, particularly any communications to unrecognized or suspicious external IP addresses. This can help identify potential command and control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated from this rule are categorized as high severity due to the potential risk of remote access compromises that could allow adversaries to gain control over systems, execute malicious payloads, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in scenarios where the adversary has obfuscated binary writes through legitimate processes or if AnyDesk has been configured to write to unexpected locations. Additionally, if the environment employs file integrity monitoring tools that block such writes, the detection may not trigger. Adversaries might alter the AnyDesk installation or configuration to avoid detection. Analysts should remain aware that false positives may arise, particularly in environments where legitimate software update mechanisms might unintentionally trigger the rule.

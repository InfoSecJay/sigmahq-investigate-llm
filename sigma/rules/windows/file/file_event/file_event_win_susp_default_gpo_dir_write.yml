  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Suspicious Files in Default GPO Folder" targets malicious activity where suspicious executable (EXE) or dynamic link library (DLL) files are copied into the default Group Policy Object (GPO) storage folder on Windows systems. This folder, identified by the GUID `{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}`, is critical for the application of Group Policies across the enterprise. The rule leverages file event logs to monitor for any creation of EXE or DLL files in this sensitive directory, suggesting potential malicious behavior such as software installation that may evade detection. This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1036.005 (Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location) and encompasses the tactic of Defense Evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Integrity:** Verify the hashes of detected files against known malware databases using EDR or AV tools to determine if they are legitimate or potentially malicious.
  - **Analyze File Metadata:** Review the creation and modification times, as well as user account associated with the file creation, to establish whether it aligns with normal operations or indicates compromise activity.
  - **Review GPO Application Events:** Utilize the Windows Event Logs to check for recent Group Policy application events which could indicate unauthorized changes to policies or scripts running from the GPO folder.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Analyze any associated network connections to understand if the suspicious files are communicating externally, which could indicate exfiltration of data or command and control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is considered medium, as the presence of suspicious files in the GPO folder may indicate an attempt at evading defenses or manipulating system configurations, warranting further investigation to assess potential risk.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot is the possibility of legitimate applications unintentionally placing files into the GPO folder, leading to false positives. Additionally, the rule may fail to trigger if the files are obfuscated or renamed, thereby evading detection. It is also assumed that all monitored systems adhere to standard configurations, and variations in GPO paths or policies may lead to differing results.

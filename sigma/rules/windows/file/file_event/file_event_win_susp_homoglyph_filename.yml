title: Potential Homoglyph Attack Using Lookalike Characters in Filename
id: 4f1707b1-b50b-45b4-b5a2-3978b5a5d0d6
status: test
description: |
  Detects the presence of unicode characters which are homoglyphs, or identical in appearance, to ASCII letter characters.
  This is used as an obfuscation and masquerading techniques. Only "perfect" homoglyphs are included; these are characters that
  are indistinguishable from ASCII characters and thus may make excellent candidates for homoglyph attack characters.

- File names with legitimate Cyrillic text. Will likely require tuning (or not be

  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential Homoglyph Attack Using Lookalike Characters in Filename" detection rule is designed to identify instances where file names contain Unicode characters that closely resemble ASCII characters, commonly known as homoglyphs. These homoglyphs can be exploited by adversaries to obfuscate file names, making malicious files appear legitimate at first glance. The rule actively looks for specific Unicode characters that appear identical to standard ASCII characters, using Windows file event logs as the primary data source. These logs, particularly `TargetFilename`, are monitored to flag file names that contain any of the designated homoglyphs, such as Cyrillic characters that mimic Latin characters. This detection is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1036) and specifically focuses on the sub-technique T1036.003, which highlights such character manipulation for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Utilize EDR for File Analysis**: Use the EDR to investigate the file details, check for previous execution history, and review any associated behaviors which might indicate malicious intent.
  - **Cross-Reference with Proxy Logs**: Analyze proxy logs to see if the flagged file was accessed or downloaded through web traffic. Look for any connections to known malicious domains that could provide context to the alert.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs**: Investigate related Windows Event logs (Security, System, Application) to assess any unusual user or process activity that coincided with the time the file was created or accessed.
  - **Assess Known Good Software**: Compare the flagged file name against a known good software library or common acceptable file names to determine if the file in question is benign or should be flagged for further analysis.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity due to the potential for evasive tactics utilized by adversaries. While not all instances indicate malicious activity, the presence of homoglyphs in file names suggests possible deceptive practices that warrant investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments where legitimate applications use Cyrillic or similar Unicode characters regularly, resulting in false positives. Additionally, if an adversary employs inventive naming conventions that do not adhere to the designated Unicode counterparts listed, the detection may fail to identify the malicious files. The effectiveness of this rule also assumes that event logging is properly configured and monitoring is active across file operations.

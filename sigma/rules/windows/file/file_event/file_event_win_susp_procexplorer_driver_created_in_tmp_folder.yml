title: Suspicious PROCEXP152.sys File Created In TMP
id: 3da70954-0f2c-4103-adff-b7440368f50e
status: test
description: |
  Detects the creation of the PROCEXP152.sys file in the application-data local temporary folder.
  This driver is used by Sysinternals Process Explorer but also by KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU) or Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs), which uses KDU.

- Other legimate tools using this driver and filename (like Sysinternals). Note -
  Clever attackers may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the driver filename.
  Therefore just Medium-level and don't rely on it.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of a file named `PROCEXP152.sys` in the application data local temporary folder, specifically under `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Temp\`. The rule leverages file event logs from Windows, specifically looking for file creation events that match the patterns indicating an unauthorized creation of this driver file, which is typically associated with Sysinternals Process Explorer. While `PROCEXP152.sys` is a legitimate driver used by Process Explorer, it can also be misused by attackers employing tools like KDU or Ghost-In-The-Logs for malicious purposes. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001), highlighting the need to monitor for suspicious use of legitimate system tools as a potential indicator of compromised environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Logs:** Investigate Windows file event logs to confirm the creation of `PROCEXP152.sys` within the specified temporary directory and check the event timestamp for correlation with user activity.
    
  - **Identify Associated Processes:** Use EDR tools to examine the processes that created the file. Specifically, look for `procexp64.exe`, `procexp.exe`, `procmon64.exe`, or `procmon.exe` in the process tree leading up to the fileâ€™s creation.
  - **Evaluate User Context:** Check Windows Security logs for the user account that initiated the process. Determine if there are any indications of unauthorized access or anomalous behavior associated with that account.
  - **Perform Endpoint Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the endpoint in question using endpoint protection and detection solutions (EDR) to identify additional suspicious behavior or artifacts that may correlate with malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been assigned a medium severity level due to the presence of both legitimate and potentially malicious uses of the `PROCEXP152.sys` driver. Analysts need to exercise caution, as the rule may produce false positives when legitimate tools are in use; however, any unexpected creation warrants immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an attacker renames the driver file or utilizes other methods to achieve similar outcomes. Additionally, legitimate processes or administrative actions may inadvertently result in similar file creations that could be flagged mistakenly. It is assumed that there is an established baseline of normal activity for users in the environment to effectively distinguish between legitimate and suspicious file creations.

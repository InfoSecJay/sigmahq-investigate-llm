  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious MSExchangeMailboxReplication ASPX Write" is designed to monitor specific file creation events that may indicate exploitation attempts linked to the ProxyShell vulnerability. It focuses on detecting the MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe process, which is responsible for mailbox replication in Microsoft Exchange environments. The rule identifies instances where this process attempts to write files with .aspx and .asp extensions to the disk. This behavior is considered unusual and potentially malicious, as it aligns with exploitation techniques aimed at establishing unauthorized persistence or initial access into an environment. The relevant data sources involved in this detection include file event logs from Windows, specifically tracking activities related to the creation or modification of files.
  This rule is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactics of Initial Access (T1190) and Persistence (T1505.003), indicating its relevance in identifying indicators of compromise related to initial entry vectors and maintaining unauthorized access within the system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Related EDR Alerts:** Review the EDR console for any alerts associated with the MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe process. Look for any abnormal behavior or additional context that could indicate a compromise.
  - **Examine File Integrity:** Investigate the .aspx and .asp files that were created by correlating file creation timestamps with other relevant logs. Determine their content to assess if they contain malicious scripts or commands.
  - **Review Process Activity:** Analyze process creation logs for the MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe instance to identify any parent processes or related activities that could suggest further exploitation efforts.
  - **Monitor Network Connections:** Utilize network detection tools to examine outbound connections initiated by the same process or other suspicious processes. Look for anomalous connections to external domains or IP addresses that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a high severity level due to the critical nature of the MSExchangeMailboxReplication process and its association with known exploitation techniques. Prompt attention is necessary to mitigate potential threats that could compromise sensitive organizational data or lead to broader network breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe binary is altered or renamed by an adversary attempting to evade detection. Additionally, if file system activity is being filtered by security configurations or if file event logging is disabled, relevant actions may go uncollected. It's crucial to ensure that all logging components are correctly configured and that baseline behaviors are well understood to minimize false negatives related to this detection rule.

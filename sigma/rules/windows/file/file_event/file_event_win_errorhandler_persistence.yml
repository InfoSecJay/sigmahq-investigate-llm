title: Potential Persistence Attempt Via ErrorHandler.Cmd
id: 15904280-565c-4b73-9303-3291f964e7f9
status: test
description: |
  Detects creation of a file named "ErrorHandler.cmd" in the "C:\WINDOWS\Setup\Scripts\" directory which could be used as a method of persistence
  The content of C:\WINDOWS\Setup\Scripts\ErrorHandler.cmd is read whenever some tools under C:\WINDOWS\System32\oobe\ (e.g. Setup.exe) fail to run for any reason.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential persistence mechanisms by monitoring the creation of a file named "ErrorHandler.cmd" in the "C:\WINDOWS\Setup\Scripts\" directory. Adversaries may leverage this file to maintain persistence on Windows systems, as its content can be executed whenever specific tools, such as Setup.exe, from the “C:\WINDOWS\System32\oobe\” path encounter errors. The rule primarily analyzes Windows file event logs to track the creation of this specific file. This activity is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Persistence** (T1547.001), which highlights various methods attackers may use to maintain access to compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Metadata:** Utilize your EDR to investigate the creation event of "ErrorHandler.cmd" by checking the timestamp, user account, and associated processes to determine the context of the file’s creation.
  - **Inspect File Content:** Examine the contents of "ErrorHandler.cmd" to ascertain its purpose and whether it contains potentially malicious commands or scripts that could affect system integrity.
  - **Check for Related Events:** Correlate events from Windows Security and Sysmon logs to identify any suspicious activities that coincide with the file creation, such as unusual process executions or access attempts.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Investigate the user account under which the file was created to see if it has any prior suspicious activity or if it aligns with expected administrative behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium due to the potential implications of an established persistence mechanism. While the file could be benign, its presence indicates a method that adversaries might exploit, necessitating further investigation before conclusions can be drawn.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that there is no legitimate use for the "ErrorHandler.cmd" file in the monitored environment. It may not trigger if the file is created remotely or via a different execution context that does not pass through the monitored file event logs. Additionally, adversaries could employ techniques to obfuscate or delete the file shortly after creation, which may lead to missed detections.

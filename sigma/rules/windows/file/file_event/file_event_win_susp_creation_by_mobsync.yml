  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activities associated with Microsoft Sync Center (mobsync.exe), specifically monitoring for the creation of suspicious file types, such as `.dll` and `.exe`. The rule works by analyzing file event logs generated within Windows environments, focusing on instances where the mobsync.exe process creates files that may indicate malicious behavior. The motivation behind monitoring mobsync.exe stems from its potential misuse for executing harmful payloads or evading security controls, as attackers might leverage legitimate system processes to blend in with normal operations. This rule aligns with MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1055 (Process Injection) and T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), indicating it addresses tactics related to execution and defense evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Activity:** Confirm that mobsync.exe was indeed the process responsible for creating the detected files by examining your EDR tool for process creation events corresponding to the timestamp of the alert.
    
  - **Analyze Created Files:** Check the properties of the created files (e.g., hashes, digital signatures) to determine their legitimacy by comparing them against known good signatures in your AV/EDR system.
    
  - **Review System Context:** Investigate the system context in which the creation occurred by examining related logs from Windows Security or Sysmon to identify any suspicious commands or unusual user behavior associated with the process.
  - **Evaluate Network Activity:** Utilize network connection logs to determine whether mobsync.exe initiated any external connections or communicated with known malicious IP addresses or domains that could indicate command and control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is set to medium due to the potential for legitimate tools to be misused by adversaries for executing malicious code; however, further contextual investigation is required to assess the true nature of the alert.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where Microsoft Sync Center is disabled or where mobsync.exe is absent. Additionally, the rule relies on the standard behavior of system processes, assuming that file creation is unusual within the context of mobsync.exe activities. Adversaries may utilize techniques to disable or spoof the behavior of this process, leading to missed detections.

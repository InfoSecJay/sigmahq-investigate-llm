  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma detection rule identifies potential persistence mechanisms via Microsoft Office Add-Ins. Specifically, it looks for the presence of files with extensions related to Microsoft Word and Excel (.wll, .xll, .xlam) located in specific startup directories. These files can be automatically loaded by their respective applications without user intervention, making them attractive to attackers seeking to maintain access or execute malicious code with minimal detection. The data sources involved primarily include file event logs that capture activities related to the creation or modification of files within the designated Microsoft Office directories. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Persistence" and technique T1137.006 ("Office Application Startup Item").
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Origins:** Review the creation and modification logs of the identified add-in files using EDR tools. This can help determine whether these files were created as part of legitimate user activity or potential malicious actions.
  - **Analyze Command Line and Process Activity:** Investigate any associated processes that executed Microsoft Office applications around the time the add-ins were modified or created. This could reveal if malicious scripts or PowerShell commands were involved in their installation.
  - **Review Office Application Add-Ins:** Use the management features of Microsoft Office to list currently enabled add-ins. Cross-reference this list with the detected files to identify any unauthorized or suspicious entries.
  - **Conduct Endpoint Behavior Monitoring:** Monitor the behaviors of the Office applications post-detection for anomalies, such as unexpected network connections or interactions with sensitive files. This will help assess the potential impact of the detected add-ins on your environment.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity as it indicates a potential method for attackers to establish persistence on a system, which could lead to further exploitation or data breaches if not promptly investigated.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if legitimate add-ins have been installed by users, as they can fall into the false positive category. Additionally, adept adversaries might obfuscate their persistence mechanisms by utilizing less common file locations or benign add-in names, thus bypassing detection. Security teams should also be cautious about the environment configuration, as users may have permissions to install add-ins that could mask malicious activity.

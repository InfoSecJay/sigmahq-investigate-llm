title: LSASS Process Dump Artefact In CrashDumps Folder
id: 6902955a-01b7-432c-b32a-6f5f81d8f625
status: test
description: Detects the presence of an LSASS dump file in the "CrashDumps" folder.
  This could be a sign of LSASS credential dumping. Techniques such as the LSASS Shtinkering
  have been seen abusing the Windows Error Reporting to dump said process.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying unauthorized dumps of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, which may reside in the "CrashDumps" folder. Such dumps can potentially contain sensitive credentials and are often a target for malicious actors using techniques like "LSASS Shtinkering," which exploits the Windows Error Reporting system to extract sensitive information from running processes. The rule monitors specific file events, particularly looking for files that start with the "C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\CrashDumps\" path, contain "lsass.exe," and have a ".dmp" extension. By doing so, it enables the detection of incidents where attackers may be attempting to extract credentials for lateral movement within the network, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Credential Access (T1003.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Presence:** Search for any entries in the event logs or file inventory for LSASS dump files within the specified CrashDumps folder path.
  - **Analyze File Content:** If a dump file is detected, utilize forensic analysis tools to examine the contents and determine if sensitive information was extracted.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate previous process creation events leading up to the dump file creation to identify any suspicious activities or anomalous process executions.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use EDR tools to assess any associated network connections or communications that may correlate with the LSASS dump file creation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential exposure of sensitive credentials that can compromise the security of the entire enterprise environment. The presence of LSASS dump files is a critical risk indicator that necessitates immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate system processes result in creating LSASS dumps, as rare legitimate crashes can occur. Additionally, adversaries may employ techniques to obscure their activities or delete dump files after creation. It assumes that all necessary logging and monitoring configurations are in place. If file event logging is not properly configured, potentially malicious activities may go undetected.

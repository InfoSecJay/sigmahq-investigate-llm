description: |
  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "GoToAssist Temporary Installation Artefact" is designed to detect potential misuse of legitimate remote access software, specifically GoToAssist, which may be exploited for malicious purposes by adversaries. This rule monitors for specific file activity in the Windows file system, particularly within the %AppData% folder under Local\Temp, where GoToAssist installs its temporary files. By focusing on the path containing `LogMeInInc\GoToAssist Remote Support Expert\`, the detection helps identify unauthorized installations or usage of the software that may facilitate a command-and-control (C2) channel in a compromised environment. This behavior is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219 (Remote Access Software) under the Command and Control tactic, highlighting the risk associated with legitimate software being employed for malicious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform for alerts related to the GoToAssist installation and examine the corresponding timestamps and device information.
  - **Analyze File Activity:** Investigate the file events in Windows Security logs to confirm the creation of suspicious files in the specified GoToAssist directory; verify if any users initiated the installation.
  - **Cross-reference User Accounts:** Identify the user accounts associated with the installation events and determine if the behavior aligns with their job roles; look for any deviations from expected usage patterns.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Utilize the network traffic logs to monitor for any outgoing connections from the endpoint after the installation, particularly to known C2 servers associated with GoToAssist.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity because while there may be legitimate reasons for the presence of GoToAssist on an endpoint, the unexpected installation or usage patterns can indicate potential unauthorized access or compromise requiring further scrutiny.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary disguises their activities using different directories or renames the files to evade detection, therefore, itâ€™s essential to monitor for other indicators of compromise associated with remote access tools. Additionally, legitimate use cases of GoToAssist within the organization may lead to false positives, thereby requiring context from user behavior analysis to accurately assess alerts.

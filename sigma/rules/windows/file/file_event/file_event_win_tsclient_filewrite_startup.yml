  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the potential misuse of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to lateral movement within an organization. Specifically, it focuses on instances where the legitimate Remote Desktop Client application (`mstsc.exe`) is utilized to create a backdoor by placing unauthorized executables into the startup folder of the RDP source machine. By monitoring file events for any creations in the `Startup` folder indicative of this behavior, this rule aids in detecting malicious activities that align with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics related to Command and Control (T1219). Key data sources for this detection are file event logs that register activities associated with file modifications and program executions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check RDP Sessions:** Review the RDP session logs in your environment to determine if there are any unusual or unauthorized connections to the affected machine during the timeframe of the alert.
    
  - **Analyze Startup Folder Contents:** Investigate the contents of the `Startup` folder on the compromised machine by utilizing file system interrogation through your endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool, noting any suspicious entries.
  - **Evaluate File Event Logs:** Examine the file event logs for `mstsc.exe` activity that corresponds to the alert, ensuring to correlate times and behaviors with legitimate user operations or known business processes.
  - **Conduct Malware Scans:** Utilize your enterprise antivirus (AV) solution to perform a comprehensive scan on the affected machine to identify any malicious files that may have been placed in the startup folder.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered high due to the potential for unauthorized lateral movement within the network, which may lead to a more significant compromise if left unaddressed. Quick investigation and mitigation are crucial to prevent further exploitation and to protect sensitive assets.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses non-traditional methods for lateral movement or if the legitimate RDP client application is misused in a non-malicious context. Additionally, if RDP logging is disabled or if file event logging is misconfigured, the detection may fail to capture unauthorized activities. Engineers should also be aware that sophisticated attackers may employ techniques to bypass detection, such as using encrypted communication or altering timestamps on files.

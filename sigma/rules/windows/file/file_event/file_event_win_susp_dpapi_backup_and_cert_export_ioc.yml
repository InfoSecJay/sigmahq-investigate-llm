  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity related to the export or theft of DPAPI (Data Protection API) backup keys and certificates. The rule specifically looks for file names that are indicative of such operations, commonly associated with tools like Mimikatz and DSInternals. It monitors file events for specific patterns in file names, including those that contain "ntds_capi_", "ntds_legacy_", or "ntds_unknown_", and have extensions that typically denote certificate or key files (such as .cer, .key, .pfx, .pvk). The rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1555 (Credentials from Password Managers) and T1552.004 (Unsecured Credentials 
  - DPAPI).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Related File Events:** Use the EDR to review file events around the time of the alert to understand the context and identify any anomalous file operations related to the detected patterns.
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Investigate process creation logs for any processes that interacted with the files identified in the alert to assess whether they originate from known malicious tools or unexpected sources.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Analyze user activity within Windows Security logs to determine if the actions were performed by legitimate users or if there are signs of account compromise or lateral movement.
  - **Search Proxy and Network Logs:** Inspect proxy and network logs for any unusual outbound connections that may correlate with the suspicious file activity, indicating potential data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the sensitivity of the detected file types and the potential risk associated with the unauthorized export of credentials, which can lead to significant security breaches.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious activity is conducted by directly manipulating files without utilizing standard processes that generate file events, or if attackers use alternative methods to store or extract keys that do not match the specified patterns. Additionally, there may be legitimate applications generating similar file names, leading to false positives. We assume that the enterprise environment has baseline knowledge about normal file activity and user behavior, which is essential for effective detection.

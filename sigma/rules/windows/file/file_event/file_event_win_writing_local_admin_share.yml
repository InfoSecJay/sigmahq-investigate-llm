  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Writing Local Admin Share" focuses on detecting attempts by adversaries to interact with remote network shares using Server Message Block (SMB). Specifically, it looks for file events where the target filename includes specific references to local admin shares, such as `\\127.0.0` or `\ADMIN$\`. This activity is commonly associated with post-exploitation frameworks and is indicative of lateral movement, allowing an attacker to transfer files or execute commands on a compromised host via the SMB protocol. The relevant technical data sources for this rule include Windows file event logs, which provide visibility into file operations and access attempts across the enterprise. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Lateral Movement, particularly under the technique T1546.002.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Event Logs:** Utilize the Windows file event logs to identify events related to access or modifications of local admin shares, focusing on timestamps and user context to determine the legitimacy of the access.
  - **Correlate EDR Alerts:** Investigate any EDR alerts triggered around the same time as the file event; look for anomalous process behavior or patterns that suggest compromise, including unexpected PowerShell execution or process creations.
  - **Evaluate Network Activity:** Check the network logs for any unusual connections to SMB shares from remote or internal IPs to assess the source of the file operations and validate whether they align with expected activity.
  - **Assess User Credentials:** Analyze the user or service account associated with the file activity to determine if the credentials were compromised or if the user should have legitimate access to the admin shares in question. 
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential indication of lateral movement within the network, which could lead to significant data exfiltration or further compromise. Quick investigation is necessary to determine if the activity is part of normal operations or indicative of an active attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary uses alternative file transfer methods or encrypted connections that bypass traditional logging mechanisms. Additionally, if users have legitimate administrative access, such activities could produce false positives, complicating analysis. It is also assumed that file event logging is enabled and properly configured across all relevant endpoints; otherwise, the rule may miss crucial telemetry.

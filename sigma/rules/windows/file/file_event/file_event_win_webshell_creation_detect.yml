  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the creation of files with certain extensions on static websites, an indication of potential webshell uploads. It specifically looks for files being created in common web directory paths such as `\inetpub\wwwroot\`, `\www\`, and `\htdocs\` that possess extensions typically associated with webshells, including `.ashx`, `.asp`, and `.ph`. By utilizing Windows File Event logs, the rule can discern when these specific file creations occur, ensuring that instances are indicative of potential malicious activity rather than legitimate actions. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of persistence, specifically focusing on technique T1505.003 (Web Shell).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Inspect File Creation Events:** Review the Windows File Event logs for the creation of files with the specified extensions in the targeted web directories to understand the context and potential intent behind the file creation.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Check related security logs to determine which user account initiated the file creation and assess whether this action aligns with their role and typical behavior.
  - **Review Endpoint Security Alerts:** Utilize EDR tools to identify if any alerts were raised during the file creation events, such as anomalous process execution or suspicious network traffic.
  - **Correlate with Web Traffic Logs:** Examine web server logs or proxy logs to see if there were any unusual requests or file accesses that coincide with the creation of these files, which may indicate exploitation attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been marked as medium severity due to the possible risk that an adversary is attempting to install a web shell to maintain persistent access. While not all instances may be malicious, the presence of file creation in web directories warrants immediate investigative response to determine legitimacy.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an attacker uses less common file extensions or if file creation is attempted in directories not covered by this rule. Additionally, legitimate developers or administrators might create files that match the criteria while conducting normal activities, potentially leading to false positives. It's also assumed that file system monitoring is appropriately configured to capture and alert on these specific events.

title: ISO or Image Mount Indicator in Recent Files
id: 4358e5a5-7542-4dcb-b9f3-87667371839b
status: test
description: |
  Detects the creation of recent element file that points to an .ISO, .IMG, .VHD or .VHDX file as often used in phishing attacks.
  This can be a false positive on server systems but on workstations users should rarely mount .iso or .img files.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the creation of shortcut files (.lnk) that reference disk image formats such as .ISO, .IMG, .VHD, and .VHDX in the Windows Recent Files directory. These types of compressed image files are frequently abused by attackers, particularly in phishing campaigns, to deliver malicious payloads or gain unauthorized access to systems. The detection leverages Windows file event logs, focusing on file creation events and specifically filtering for shortcut files that are intended to quickly link to these image files. By monitoring for these activity indicators, the rule aims to identify potential initial access strategies employed by adversaries as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Initial Access (T1566.001: Spear Phishing Attachment).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Endpoint Activity**: Utilize EDR tools to inspect the endpoint where the alert was triggered. Check for any unusual processes or recent activity related to the shortcut file creation.
  - **Analyze File Access**: Examine the contents of the detected .lnk files to identify any malicious file paths leading to downloaded ISO or image files. Cross-reference these paths against known malicious indicators.
  - **Check User Behavior**: Consult user activity logs to determine if the file creation aligns with legitimate user actions or if it appears anomalous within the context of their roles.
  - **Evaluate Network Connections**: Use firewall and NDR tools to scrutinize any outbound connections made from the involved endpoint around the time of the alert. This can help identify potential data exfiltration or communication with suspicious external addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the detection specifically targets potentially malicious activities associated with phishing, the severity level is set to medium. This reflects the need for timely investigation but also acknowledges that false positives can occur due to legitimate file usage in certain environments.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where users frequently mount image files for legitimate purposes, particularly on server systems where such activities may be normal. Additionally, if the shortcut files are created or modified through non-standard methods or automated scripts, they may evade detection. Engineers should be aware that malicious actors might obfuscate their activities by utilizing less common file extensions or directories, undermining the effectiveness of this detection rule.

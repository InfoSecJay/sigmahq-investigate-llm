  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The "ScreenConnect Temporary Installation Artefact" detection rule is designed to identify suspicious file activity associated with the installation of ScreenConnect, a remote desktop software commonly used for providing remote assistance. Adversaries may leverage such legitimate software to gain unauthorized access to systems within an enterprise, establishing a command and control (C2) channel. This rule specifically looks for files with names containing '\Bin\ScreenConnect.', which indicates potential unauthorized installations or modifications related to the ScreenConnect application. The rule utilizes file event data from Windows systems to monitor for this specific file pattern, allowing detection of potentially malicious usage of remote desktop tools.
  The identification of this abnormal activity is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Command and Control tactic (ID: T1219), which refers to the use of remote services to establish a control channel by adversaries. By monitoring these activity patterns, organizations can enhance their security posture against threats that exploit trusted remote assistance tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review EDR logs for any recent alerts on the target systems that correlate with the detected ScreenConnect file activity. Assess if there are any signs of unauthorized access or abnormal behavior from user accounts.
  - **Investigate Process Creation Logs:** Utilize Sysmon logs to look for process creation events related to the ScreenConnect executable or associated components. Confirm if any suspicious parent processes initiated these actions.
  - **Examine Network Activity:** Inspect network logs for outbound connections made to known ScreenConnect domains or IP addresses during the time frame of the alert. Analyze traffic patterns for any unauthorized or unusual connections.
  - **Audit User Activity:** Review security logs to track user actions before and after the installation event. Identify whether legitimate users executed the installation or if it aligns with any known support operations.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is classified as medium due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized installations of remote access software, which can lead to significant security incidents if exploited by malicious actors. Prompt investigation is necessary to mitigate potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the adversary uses alternative methods to install or execute the ScreenConnect software that do not include the specified file patterns. It also assumes that file auditing is enabled and properly configured to capture these events. Additionally, the rule may generate false positives during legitimate use, such as authorized IT support team activities, which may not be immediately recognizable. Security teams should be aware of environments where application control lists may exempt this software from logging.

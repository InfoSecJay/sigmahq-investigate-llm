  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect unusual activities involving the creation of temporary files that are associated with the PCRE.NET package, specifically looking for the presence of a specific filename pattern within the `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp` directory. The rule monitors file event logs on Windows systems, particularly for file creation events targeting this specific directory, which can be indicative of potentially malicious behavior, such as the execution of unauthorized or unmonitored programs. 
  This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques of Execution (T1059), highlighting the importance of monitoring file changes that may signify the execution of scripts or applications through malicious means. By capturing these file creation events, SOC analysts can identify and respond to potential threats leveraging the PCRE.NET package as part of an attack vector.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Suspicious Processes:** Examine the EDR console for processes that created the identified temporary files, reviewing their parent processes and command-line arguments for any signs of exploitative behavior.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Security, System, and Application logs to identify any related event IDs at the time of the detected file creation; look for abnormal logins or service accounts that could indicate misuse.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Utilize NDR and firewall logs to trace any outbound connections made by the suspicious process, paying particular attention to connections made immediately after temp file creation which could suggest data exfiltration or communication with command-and-control servers.
  - **Check Antivirus and Proxy Logs:** Review the AV logs and proxy server activity for any blocked or flagged interactions related to the process or its associated files, as these may provide additional context on the scope and nature of the incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as "high" severity because the creation of executable files in the temporary directory can often be a precursor to a successful exploitation or malware deployment, potentially impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of enterprise systems.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger under certain conditions if the malicious activity does not generate temp files in the expected directory or uses obfuscation techniques, such as renaming or hiding files in alternative locations. Additionally, if legitimate applications create temp files as part of their normal operation, this may lead to false positives. It is assumed that all relevant telemetry is being collected and that there are no users intentionally avoiding detection through advanced techniques. Consequently, analysts should remain vigilant for anomalous behavior across other operational areas in conjunction with this detection.

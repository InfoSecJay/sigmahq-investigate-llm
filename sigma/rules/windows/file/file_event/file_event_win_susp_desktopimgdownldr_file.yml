  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the creation of suspicious files by Microsoft's `desktopimgdownldr` process, specifically targeting files that are stored in atypical locations or have potentially harmful file extensions. The rule is particularly focused on any instances where the process creates image files (like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png`) within the `Personalization\LockScreenImage\` directory. It utilizes Windows file event logs to monitor behaviors surrounding the `svchost.exe` image, which is commonly utilized by various Windows services. When the process generates image files in these specified conditions without legitimate file paths or extensions associated with it, an alert is triggered. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK framework technique for this behavior is **T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer**, which refers to the method by which adversaries move files into a target environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs**: Review the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) logs for the `svchost.exe` process to identify any abnormal command-line arguments or parent processes that may suggest malicious activity. Pay particular attention to the context of where the process initiated.
  - **Analyze File Events**: Utilize the SIEM and filter for file creation events linked to `desktopimgdownldr`, focusing on the `C:\Users\*\Personalization\LockScreenImage\` directory. Verify the legitimacy of the files created, including examining their previous usage or the creation timeline.
  - **Review Process Tree**: Investigate the process tree associated with `svchost.exe` at the time of the alert. Understanding which parent processes launched `svchost.exe` can help reveal if it was initiated from a legitimate or malicious source.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs**: Query network logs for any unusual outgoing connections or DNS queries correlated with the timestamp of the file creation. This can reveal whether the process was attempting to communicate with a command-and-control server.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity level due to the risk of file-based attacks which may exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate processes like `svchost.exe`. The creation of suspicious files in critical directories may indicate an attempt to establish persistence or to execute further malicious actions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the monitored environment utilizes administrative tools or scripts that also create files with similar extensions in the `LockScreenImage` directory, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an adversary employs methods to obfuscate their file creation paths or uses process hollowing techniques, the rule might be evaded. It's assumed that all relevant logging is enabled and properly configured in the enterprise environment; any misconfigurations may result in a failure to capture the required events.

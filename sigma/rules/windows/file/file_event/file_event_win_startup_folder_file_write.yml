  ### Technical Context
  The "Startup Folder File Write" detection rule is designed to identify unauthorized file creations within the Windows Startup directory. This directory is a common target for adversaries aiming to achieve persistence on compromised systems. The rule specifically looks for file events where the `TargetFilename` contains the path to the Startup folder (`\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`). By filtering out legitimate processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and specific filenames that start with `C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\NewOS\`, the rule aims to minimize false positives associated with normal system operations. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for persistence, specifically T1547.001, which highlights methods adversaries use to maintain access to systems by creating persistent executables in Startup locations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Utilize your endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to investigate the alert triggered by this rule. Look for related process activities that occurred around the time the file was created in the Startup folder.
  - **Analyze Windows Event Logs**: Check Windows Security and Sysmon logs for process creation events and file modification logs. Cross-reference timestamps and user account activities with the files created in the Startup folder.
  - **Inspect File Attributes**: Conduct a thorough examination of the file attributes of the new entries in the Startup folder. Investigate the digital signatures or creation contexts of these files to determine their legitimacy.
  - **Query Proxy and VPN Logs**: Search the proxy and VPN logs for any unusual outbound connections made by accounts that accessed the system around the same timeframe. This will help in identifying potential Command and Control (C2) communication.
  ### Prioritization
  When this alert is fired, it should be treated with medium severity as it indicates potential unauthorized changes that could lead to persistent malicious activity. Prompt action is essential, as unchecked persistence mechanisms can compromise the integrity of an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if legitimate applications create files in the Startup directory without interactions that would trigger alerts, such as using methods that bypass standard logging or monitoring layers. Additionally, if an adversary employs stealth techniques, such as modifying legitimate applications to write to this directory, the alerts may not fire. There is an assumption that the endpoints are adequately logging file events, which may not be the case in all environments due to log configuration settings or resource limitations.

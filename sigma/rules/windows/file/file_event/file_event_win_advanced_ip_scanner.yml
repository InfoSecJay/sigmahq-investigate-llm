  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Advanced IP Scanner 
  - File Event" is designed to detect the presence of the Advanced IP Scanner application, which is often misused by threat actors, particularly ransomware groups, to map out network resources and identify potential targets. Specifically, this rule monitors the Windows file event logs for file activity indicating that the Advanced IP Scanner has been executed, looking for patterns where the executable is present in the userâ€™s temporary files directory, specifically within the path `\AppData\Local\Temp\Advanced IP Scanner 2`. The technical data sources involved in this detection are primarily Windows file events that capture file creation or modification activities. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic 'Discovery' and technique 'Network Service Scanning' (T1046), as it seeks to identify reconnaissance activities that could precede more malicious actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Event Logs:** Use Windows file event logs within the SIEM to identify any recent activities related to `Advanced IP Scanner` to gather context on when and how it was executed.
  - **Conduct EDR Investigations:** Check your EDR solution to correlate any detected processes with the file events, focusing on whether the Advanced IP Scanner was executed in a suspicious manner or alongside other malicious indicators.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Utilize network logs and EDR telemetry to verify any unusual outbound connections made by the system that had the scanner running, which can point to potential data exfiltration or further exploitation.
  - **Assess User Behavior:** Investigate user activity around the time of the scan by checking user logs in Active Directory or the cloud platform to see if the execution aligns with common administrative tasks or if it appears anomalous.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert's severity is considered medium due to the potential association of the Advanced IP Scanner with reconnaissance efforts by malicious actors, particularly in environments where its use is not typical for legitimate administrative activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the Advanced IP Scanner is executed from another directory or if the activity occurs outside normal logging periods. Furthermore, legitimate administrative use may lead to false positives, and there could be cases of adversaries renaming or modifying the binaries to evade detection. It's important for other engineers to understand that obfuscated or modified executables could evade the simple string match in this rule, highlighting the need for additional contextual analysis beyond this detection.

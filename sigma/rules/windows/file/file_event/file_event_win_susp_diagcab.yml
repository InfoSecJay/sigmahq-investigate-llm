  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of `.diagcab` files within a Windows environment. The `.diagcab` file extension is associated with diagnostic cab packages often utilized by installation and troubleshooting processes in Windows. However, its creation may also signify suspicious activities, such as malware attempting to leverage legitimate file types for nefarious purposes, particularly during exploitation phases. The rule primarily inspects file event logs to capture when any file with the `.diagcab` extension is created. Relevant data sources include Windows file event logs, which provide insights into file operations, allowing investigators to examine the context of such file creations. This detection corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK technique of Resource Development, where adversaries prepare tools that can facilitate their operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Context:** Investigate the creation of the identified `.diagcab` file by checking the file path and ensuring it aligns with legitimate use cases related to Microsoft software installations or diagnostics.
    
  - **Analyze Surrounding Events:** Correlate the timestamp of the `.diagcab` file creation with other log sources, such as process creation logs, to detect any abnormal processes or unauthorized access that may have preceded the creation event.
    
  - **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Utilize EDR tools to look for known malicious indicators related to `.diagcab` files or associated processes, and assess whether any related artifacts are present in the system.
    
  - **Engage Endpoint Security Solutions:** Leverage antivirus and endpoint detection solutions to scan for any additional malicious payload or behavior associated with the `.diagcab` file, and verify the integrity of surrounding files.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a medium severity level due to the potential for exploitation techniques being associated with the creation of `.diagcab` files, warranting timely investigation to determine legitimacy and to mitigate potential threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is important to note that this detection rule may not fire if the `.diagcab` files are created through legitimate software installations or if the monitoring policies are not comprehensive in logging relevant file events. Additionally, attackers may utilize techniques to obfuscate their actions, such as renaming files or creating `.diagcab` files in non-standard environments that may not be covered by the existing rules.

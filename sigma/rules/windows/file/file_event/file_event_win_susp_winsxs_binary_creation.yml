  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of executable files (.exe) within the Windows Side-by-Side (WinSxS) folder by non-system processes. The WinSxS folder is typically used by Windows to store multiple versions of shared utilities, and executable file creation in this directory by non-standard processes can indicate potential malicious activity, such as malware attempting to hide or persist within system files. The rule leverages file event logs from the Windows operating system to capture relevant activities, specifically looking for events where the target filename starts with 'C:\Windows\WinSxS\' and ends with '.exe'. By filtering out actions performed by known system processes located in 'C:\Windows\System32\', 'C:\Windows\SysWOW64\', or the WinSxS directory itself, this detection focuses on unauthorized attempts to manipulate system files, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (T1203: Exploitation for Client Execution).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts related to the specific device that triggered the rule to investigate the originating process and its behavior for any anomalies or indicators of compromise.
    
  - **Inspect File Creation Events:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to look for event ID 4688 indicating process creation during the time of the suspicious file creation, verifying if it corresponds with the identified non-system process.
  - **Review Process Chain:** Investigate the parent-child process relationships through Sysmon logs to determine how the suspicious executable was spawned, and whether it is part of a larger attack pattern.
  - **Leverage File Integrity Monitoring:** Cross-reference the created executable against known malicious hashes and maintain a line of inquiry regarding any other files created or modified in the timeframe surrounding the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the creation of executables in the WinSxS folder can be indicative of malicious activity, the severity level is classified as medium. Alerts warrant prompt investigation, as they can signal an attempt to employ persistence mechanisms or bypass security controls.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the non-system process uses a legitimate Windows service to create files or if the malicious executable is created through alternative user paths or methods not captured by the specified logs. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions that create executables in the WinSxS folder may generate false positives. Engineers should consider refining the detection logic if such activities are common in the operational environment, as adversaries may attempt to blend malicious activity with legitimate use cases.

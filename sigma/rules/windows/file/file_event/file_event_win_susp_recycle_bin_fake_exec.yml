  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious file creation activities in folders resembling the Windows Recycle Bin (e.g., `C:\$RECYCLER.BIN`), often used by attackers as a staging area to conceal malicious files or execute persistence techniques. The rule monitors for file write events, inspecting the characteristics of the targeted file paths that include variations of "RECYCLERS.BIN" and associated paths. By leveraging the Windows file event logs, it is capable of capturing abnormal activity tied to illegitimate or malicious use of these folder structures. This activity is in line with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of persistence and defense evasion, specifically focusing on evasion methods through misleading directory naming.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Context of the Alert:** Check the file creation event details in Windows File Event logs to ascertain the user account involved, the application used, and the timestamp to understand the context of the activity.
  - **Assess User Account Activity:** Use EDR and Windows Security logs to track the actions performed by the concerned user account prior to and after the alert, noting any unusual behavior or indicators of compromise.
  - **Cross-reference with Other Logs:** Review network connection logs and proxy logs to identify if any external communications were established post file creation, particularly with known malicious IPs or domains.
  - **Scan for Malware:** Execute a full scan using AV tools across the endpoint where the suspicious activity was detected, looking for known signatures that may correspond with malware samples.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to its association with potential malware staging and persistence mechanisms, which can indicate an ongoing attack or compromise, requiring immediate investigation to mitigate risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if the attacker uses randomized or uncommon folder names that do not resemble the Recycle Bin naming convention. It also assumes that relevant file event logging is enabled and that any changes to file creation paths are being accurately monitored. Misconfigured logging systems or advanced threats employing stealthy tactics could evade detection, emphasizing the necessity for comprehensive monitoring strategies.

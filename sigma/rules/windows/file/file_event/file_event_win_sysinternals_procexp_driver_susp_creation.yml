title: Process Explorer Driver Creation By Non-Sysinternals Binary
id: de46c52b-0bf8-4936-a327-aace94f94ac6
status: test
description: |
  Detects creation of the Process Explorer drivers by processes other than Process Explorer (procexp) itself.
  Hack tools or malware may use the Process Explorer driver to elevate privileges, drops it to disk for a few moments, runs a service using that driver and removes it afterwards.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled **"Process Explorer Driver Creation By Non-Sysinternals Binary"** targets the unexpected creation of drivers associated with Process Explorer (PROCEXP) by processes that are not the legitimate Process Explorer executable itself. Typically, attackers may exploit the functionality provided by these drivers to gain elevated privileges or perform malicious actions without detection. The rule monitors for file events that indicate a driver file (with a `.sys` extension) is being created with a filename that contains "PROCEXP," while specifically excluding any creation attempts originating from the official Process Explorer binary (either `procexp.exe` or `procexp64.exe`). This detection leverages various Windows Event Logs, particularly focusing on file event logs related to driver creation, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for persistence (T1068) and privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process Source:** Utilize EDR to check the originating process of the driver creation. Ensure it is not from a legitimate `procexp` instance and investigate any unknown or suspicious process associations.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Review behavior patterns of the identified process using Windows Sysmon logs, focusing on any anomalous process creation or unusual command-line arguments that indicate potential misuse.
  - **Inspect Driver Usage:** Check for any ongoing or recent operations using the flagged driver via system logs. Look for instances of service creation tied to it that may signify attempts to persist malicious activity.
  - **Correlate Network Activities:** Utilize the NDR and firewall logs to assess any network connections made by the suspect process. Identify potential callback or communication with external malicious infrastructures.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for serious threats associated with unauthorized driver creation, which may indicate malicious intent to escalate privileges and maintain persistence within the network environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule is effective in detecting unauthorized driver creations, it may not fire if an adversary renames or obfuscates the legitimate Process Explorer binaries to evade detection. Additionally, the rule assumes that the file system monitoring correctly captures all file creation events and that security measures are in place to flag observable deviations. Environments without Sysmon or insufficient event collection may also miss critical log entries necessary for detection.

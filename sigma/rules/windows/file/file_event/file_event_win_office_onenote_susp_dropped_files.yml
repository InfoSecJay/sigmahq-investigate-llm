  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets suspicious file creation activities initiated by the OneNote application on Windows systems. Specifically, it logs events where OneNote (identified by the executable image path such as `\onenote.exe`, `\onenotem.exe`, and `\onenoteim.exe`) produces files in the temporary OneNote directory located at `\AppData\Local\Temp\OneNote\`. The rule checks for specific file extensions typically associated with malicious activities, such as `.bat`, `.exe`, `.vbs`, and others. Recent trends in malware deployment have seen threat actors exploiting OneNote's capabilities to deliver malicious files, providing a new avenue for attacks and bypassing traditional security measures. This alert corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and leverages file event logs from Windows to identify potentially harmful file creations associated with OneNote.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Endpoint Activity:** Utilize your EDR tool to examine the endpoint where the alert was triggered, focusing on the OneNote process and any related activities that may indicate malicious intentions.
  - **Analyze File Creation Details:** Investigate the specific file created by OneNote by examining its properties and hash values, checking against known malware databases or your organizationâ€™s threat intelligence.
  - **Check for Previous Incidents:** Look through security logs and historical data for similar incidents involving OneNote to understand the potential persistence of this threat or if it is part of a broader attack pattern.
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to analyze outbound network connections from the affected endpoint, particularly around the time of the file creation, to determine if there was any ulterior motive, such as data exfiltration or command and control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert is classified as high severity, it underscores the potential risk of malware deployment and the need for immediate investigation to mitigate any adverse impact on enterprise operations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger alerts if OneNote is heavily utilized for legitimate purposes within the organization, leading to potential false positives, particularly if users share various legitimate documents or scripts through OneNote. Additionally, if an adversary obfuscates the file creation or exploits a less common extension not listed in the rule, the detection could fail. Awareness of varying user behaviors and potential malware evolution is crucial for analysts to contextualize the alerts effectively.

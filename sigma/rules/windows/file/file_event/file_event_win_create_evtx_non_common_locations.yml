title: EVTX Created In Uncommon Location
id: 65236ec7-ace0-4f0c-82fd-737b04fd4dcb
status: test
description: |
  Detects the creation of new files with the ".evtx" extension in non-common or non-standard location.
  This could indicate tampering with default EVTX locations in order to evade security controls or simply exfiltration of event log to search for sensitive information within.
  Note that backup software and legitimate administrator might perform similar actions during troubleshooting.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of files with the ".evtx" extension in locations that are not commonly associated with event log files. Typically, Windows event log files are stored within the `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\` directory. By monitoring for the creation of ".evtx" files elsewhere, such as in temporary directories or user directories, this rule helps identify potential evasion tactics employed by adversaries seeking to manipulate or exfiltrate important log information without detection. The rule leverages Windows Sysmon's file event logging to capture relevant telemetry, looking for any instances where ".evtx" files are created outside expected paths, thus aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.002 (Impair Defenses: Indicator Removal on Host).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs**: Review Sysmon logs for file event creations related to ".evtx" files to determine the source and context of the creation event.
  - **Examine Process Activity**: Investigate the process associated with the creation of the ".evtx" file by utilizing your EDR tool to assess its behavior and shadow history.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Analyze activity logs from the system or application to identify any legitimate administrative actions or backup processes occurring around the same timeframe.
  - **Search for Related Network Activity**: Utilize network logs to determine if there were any outbound connections or suspicious behaviors that align with the creation of the ".evtx" file.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity due to the potential of tampering with event logs, which could impede incident response efforts. However, its context may also reflect legitimate administrative activities, necessitating careful investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if the process responsible for file creation has the appropriate permissions or is a whitelisted application. Additionally, if malicious actors leverage legitimate tools or create ".evtx" files under conditions mimicking administrator activity, it could defeat the detection. The rule assumes that Sysmon is correctly configured to monitor ".evtx" files and that the monitored file paths are sufficient to cover potential evasion strategies.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the creation of ISO (disk image) files in specific temporary directories associated with Microsoft Outlook and user application data. The rule specifically looks for files created in either the `AppData\Local\Temp` directory or the `AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook` directory, both of which are common locations for temporary files used by various applications. An ISO file created in these locations can indicate potentially malicious behavior, particularly tactics employed by Qakbot—a malware strain known for side-loading malicious DLLs, which can often exploit legitimate application behavior to remain under the radar.
  The relevant technical data sources for this rule include file event logs from Windows, which capture detailed information about file creation activities, such as the file names and paths involved. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Initial Access (T1566.001) by monitoring for potentially suspicious files that may act as triggers for further compromise or exploitation within an enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify File Path:** Check the target file path in the detected alert to confirm it falls within the `AppData\Local\Temp` or `INetCache\Content.Outlook` directories, ensuring that the alert is pertinent to the expected locations.
  - **Review Process Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate any processes that created or accessed the suspicious ISO files. Look for anomalies such as unrecognized process names or unusual command-line arguments.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Monitor the network traffic logs (NDR) for any connections made shortly after the ISO file creation, especially to known malicious domains or unusual external IPs that could indicate further malicious activity.
  - **Check User Context:** Review the user’s recent activity in the proxy logs or via VPN logs to determine if the user behavior aligns with known patterns, especially if the alert is triggered on a service account or unattended machine.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential risk associated with malware like Qakbot that exploits these conditions to gain access to the target environment. ISO files in these directories have a high potential for being part of a malicious attack chain, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where an attacker employs obfuscation techniques, such as renaming or moving files post-creation, or if legitimate processes create ISO files without malicious intent (e.g., system administrators handling ISO files). Additionally, environments that have strict file-type restrictions on these directories might see fewer legitimate cases leading to missed alerting opportunities. Assumptions include the reliability of file event logs and that files are created under user accounts rather than service accounts that may not trigger similar alerts.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Wmiprvse Wbemcomn DLL Hijack 
  - File" is designed to detect a specific type of malicious activity associated with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This rule watches for the creation of a file named `wbemcomn.dll` in the `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\` directory. Malicious actors often use DLL hijacking as a technique to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, thereby gaining unauthorized access or control over the system. The rule operates on file event logs that capture the creation of files within the specified directory. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution and Lateral Movement, specifically techniques T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation) and T1021.002 (Remote Services: WMI). Detecting this file creation is crucial, as it is commonly a precursor to further lateral movement or exploitation within the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Confirm File Creation**: Use a SIEM tool to query for file creation events in `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\`, specifically looking for `wbemcomn.dll`. Verify the timestamp and source of the event, particularly focusing on network-related actions.
    
  - **Analyze Network Activity**: Investigate the network logs to identify any suspicious communications that might have facilitated the file transfer or creation. Correlate these with the timestamp of the file creation event to uncover any potential external connections.
  - **Inspect WMI Activities**: Utilize EDR tools to monitor and analyze any WMI-related activities around the time the `wbemcomn.dll` file was created. This can help detect unusual or unauthorized calls that may indicate exploitation.
  - **Review Malware Signatures**: Scan the system and network for indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with known malware that employ DLL hijacking techniques. Leverage your AV solutions and threat intelligence feeds for additional context.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as critical due to the potential for significant impact associated with DLL hijacking, which can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise if not acted upon swiftly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if the file is created under a different name or in a different directory, or if the creation occurs via legitimate administrative actions. Additionally, if file logging is disabled or compromised, this detection could be entirely bypassed. Adversaries may also use techniques to mask their actions, such as using obfuscation methods or delivering the payload through alternative mechanisms.

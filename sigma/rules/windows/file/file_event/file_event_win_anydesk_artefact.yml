title: Anydesk Temporary Artefact
id: 0b9ad457-2554-44c1-82c2-d56a99c42377
status: test
description: |
  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The "Anydesk Temporary Artefact" detection rule aims to identify potential misuse of AnyDesk, a remote desktop application often leveraged for legitimate remote support. Adversaries may exploit such software to establish control over target systems while masquerading as legitimate users. This Sigma rule focuses on detecting the presence of specific configuration files—`user.conf` and `system.conf`—which are typically located in the AppData Roaming directory of Windows systems. Monitoring file events related to these artifacts aids in identifying instances where this remote access tool may be improperly employed, serving as an indicator of potential command-and-control (C2) activity as outlined in MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219 (Remote Access Software).
  The rule utilizes data sources that record events related to file creation and modification, significantly enhancing visibility into unauthorized use of remote access tools. By focusing on configuration files that signal the setup of AnyDesk, this detection provides a specific lens through which incident responders can identify and investigate potentially malicious activity in real-time.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Events:** Check the Windows file event logs for any entries regarding access or changes to `user.conf` and `system.conf` files. Note the timestamps and associated user accounts for any unexpected patterns.
    
  - **Utilize EDR Tools:** Use EDR solutions to trace the process lineage and behavior associated with AnyDesk's execution. Pay attention to any unusual network connections or process interactions that may indicate malicious activity.
    
  - **Cross-Reference User Accounts:** Investigate user accounts associated with the detected events to ensure they correspond to familiar legitimate users. Check for any accounts that may not conform to established naming conventions or security practices.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic logs for any outbound connections originating from devices running AnyDesk, particularly to abnormal or non-business-related destinations. Assess whether this traffic aligns with legitimate use or suggests unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized remote access that could lead to data breaches or system compromise. Given the commonality of legitimate usage in many IT support environments, it requires careful examination to distinguish between normal and suspicious actions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire under several circumstances, such as when adversaries delete or modify the targeted configuration files before it's logged, or when users employ obfuscation techniques to hide unauthorized installations. Additionally, systems where AnyDesk is legitimately used might lead to false positives, complicating investigation efforts. It is also assumed that appropriate logging settings are configured on endpoint devices to capture relevant file events effectively.

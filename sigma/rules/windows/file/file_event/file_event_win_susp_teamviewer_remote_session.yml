  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets the creation of log files related to TeamViewer remote sessions on Windows systems. It identifies file event logs where specific filenames stem from the TeamViewer directory, particularly focusing on log files such as `tvprint.db` and any `_Logfile.log` created in the TeamViewer directory. The rule uses Windows File Event logs as the primary data source to filter events by examining whether the filenames match the specified patterns. Given the goal of monitoring for unauthorized access or misuse of TeamViewer, this rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics related to Command and Control (T1219), which covers the use of remote access tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Creation Logs:** Review the file events within the Windows Security logs for the associated entries detailing the creation of the identified log files, especially focusing on timestamps relevant to user activity.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Use EDR tools to investigate the user and session activity on the endpoints where the alerts were triggered, assessing whether unauthorized remote access has occurred during the timeline of the log file creation.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Examine network logs and activity to determine if a remote connection via TeamViewer was established, identifying any suspicious IP addresses or unexpected geographic locations.
  - **Assess Legitimate Usage:** Contact relevant business units to confirm if TeamViewer was being used for intended purposes during the noted timeframes, which may help validate or dismiss the findings.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium because while legitimate use cases exist for TeamViewer, unexpected log file creation can signal potential misuse or unauthorized access, warranting a timely investigation to mitigate risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if an organization does not utilize TeamViewer or if remote sessions occur without generating the expected log files. Additionally, if an adversary is adept at obscuring their tracks, such as deleting logs immediately post-creation or manipulating permission settings, vital evidence may be lost. Analysts should also consider the possibility of legitimate administrative actions leading to the same log file creation, which could introduce false positives in the detection.

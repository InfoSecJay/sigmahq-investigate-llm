  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious File Created In PerfLogs" is designed to identify potentially malicious files created in the "C:\PerfLogs\" directory on Windows systems. This location is predominantly used for storing performance telemetry logs, which are typically in the ".etl" format. By monitoring for file creations in this directory with non-standard extensions—such as compressed files, executable scripts, and potentially harmful formats—the rule aims to detect suspicious activities that could indicate an attempt by an adversary to obfuscate malicious file types or payloads. The rule leverages Windows file event logs as its primary data source to capture the necessary file creation activities. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of execution, specifically technique T1059, which focuses on command and script execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Creation Events**: Query the enterprise EDR for recent file creation logs specific to the "C:\PerfLogs\" directory to identify any unusual extensions that triggered the alert. Pay special attention to timestamps and associated processes.
    
  - **Examine Process Behavior**: Investigate the parent processes that initiated the file creations. Use the EDR's process tree view to trace back any anomalies to their origin, especially focusing on processes with suspicious command-line arguments.
    
  - **Cross-Reference with AV/EDR**: Check the alert against the indicators and intelligence provided by your AV and EDR solutions to see if the created files are recognized as malicious or have a known association with adversary tactics.
    
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: If network activity is detected around the time of the file creation, review relevant network connection logs to determine if there were any suspicious outbound connections related to the file or its originating process.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is categorized as medium due to the potential risk associated with anomalous file creations in a directory that typically contains system performance logs. Malicious files in this location could signal an attempt to compromise system integrity or facilitate further malicious actions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses uncommon file extensions not specified in the detection list or if they directly manipulate file creation timestamps to evade detection. Furthermore, it assumes that Sysmon is configured correctly to log file events. Organizations should also consider that legitimate tools could create files in this directory with non-standard extensions, thus leading to potential false positives.

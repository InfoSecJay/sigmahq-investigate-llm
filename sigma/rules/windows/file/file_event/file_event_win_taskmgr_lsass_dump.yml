  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential credential theft activity through the monitoring of the Windows Task Manager (taskmgr.exe). The rule triggers when a memory dump of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process is created, specifically looking for the generation of a file named "lsass.dmp" in the user's temporary files directory. The LSASS process contains sensitive information related to user credentials, and its unauthorized memory dumping is a tactic often employed by attackers to harvest this data. The detection relies on file event logs, particularly the detection of file creation actions linked to the taskmgr.exe process. The applicable MITRE ATT&CK technique related to this detection is T1003.001, which focuses on "Credential Dumping" via LSASS memory.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review File Activity:** Check the file creation logs for any lsass.dmp files created within the AppData\Local\Temp directory, noting the timestamps and the user account involved.
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Utilize your EDR tool to analyze the process tree related to taskmgr.exe, verifying if it was executed by legitimate administrative actions or if it appeared suspiciously during an unexpected timeframe.
  - **Investigate User Activity:** Look for any concurrent or earlier user activity related to the account that created the memory dump, paying attention to any unusual logins or accounts accessing sensitive resources.
  - **Cross-reference with Alerts:** Check if there are other security alerts or logs in the system, such as network connections from unusual IP addresses, which could correlate with the potential breach indicated by the memory dump creation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity due to its direct relationship with potential credential theft exploits, which could lead to broader access across the enterprise network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses a different method or tool for performing the memory dump instead of taskmgr.exe, or if the LSASS process is dumped using processes with non-standard naming conventions. The detection relies heavily on the apparatus of taskmgr.exe, and sophisticated adversaries may avoid using common utilities, opting instead for custom or in-memory payloads that do not generate recognizable signatures in the logs. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions, such as troubleshooting, could potentially trigger false positives, necessitating further investigation.

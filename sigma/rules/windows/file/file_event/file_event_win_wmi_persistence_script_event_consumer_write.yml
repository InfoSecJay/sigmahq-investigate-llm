  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious file write activities involving the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) script event consumer. Specifically, it monitors for file writes executed by `scrcons.exe` located in `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\`. The presence of this executable writing files may indicate an attempt to establish persistence mechanisms commonly exploited by adversaries. By observing this behavior, incident responders can potentially identify unauthorized script event consumers that could be utilized for nefarious purposes, aligning with the ATT&CK technique for persistence (T1546.003). The key data sources involved in this detection are file event logs that record file creation and modification actions on Windows systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review file event logs in the SIEM to identify any recent writes involving `scrcons.exe`, noting the timestamps and target file paths.
  - Utilize EDR tooling to investigate the process tree around `scrcons.exe`, assessing any unusual parent processes or execution chains that led to the file write.
  - Search for related logs in the Windows Event Viewer, specifically targeting WMI activity, to identify other potential indicators of compromise or abnormal behavior.
  - If applicable, cross-reference the findings with any existing detections from anti-virus tools or endpoint telemetry that may flag persistent WMI scripts or similar behaviors.

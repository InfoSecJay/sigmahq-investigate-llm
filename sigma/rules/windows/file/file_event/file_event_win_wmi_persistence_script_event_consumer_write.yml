  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious file write operations performed by the WMI Script Event Consumer, specifically targeting the executable located at `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\scrcons.exe`. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a powerful feature in Windows that allows for the automated management of system resources and configuration settings. Adversaries may leverage this capability to establish persistence on a compromised system by creating or modifying event consumers to execute malicious scripts. By monitoring file write events associated with `scrcons.exe`, this rule aims to surface potentially unauthorized modifications that may indicate persistent malware behavior, correlating with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence (T1546.003). The primary data sources used in this detection are file event logs, specifically focusing on file system changes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Alert**: Check the specifics of the alert in your SIEM, including timestamps and source processes to confirm if the file creation or modification was unexpected or part of normal operations.
  - **Examine File Metadata**: Use your EDR or any file integrity monitoring tools to review the file's properties (e.g., creation date, last modified date) and verify whether it has known hashes or signatures that match legitimate software.
  - **Review WMI Event Logs**: Query the WMI logs via PowerShell or your centralized logging platform to examine recent script events, identifying any unusual or unauthorized activity associated with the identified executables.
  - **Conduct Network Analysis**: Utilize network detection tools (NDR/NGFW) to analyze outbound connections from the affected host, checking for any irregular or malicious traffic patterns that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been marked as high severity due to the potential exploitation of WMI for persistence, which is a common tactic among threat actors seeking to maintain access to a compromised system. The presence of unauthorized file writes, particularly in a critical system directory, warrants immediate investigation to prevent potential escalation or data compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in scenarios where the executable has been renamed or relocated by an adversary, leading to missed detection of persistence mechanisms. Additionally, there are assumptions regarding legitimate operations from known applications that utilize `scrcons.exe`, such as Dell Power Manager. Properly tuning the rule may be necessary to reduce false positives while maintaining its effectiveness against real threats.

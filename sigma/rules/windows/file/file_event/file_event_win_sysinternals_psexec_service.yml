  ### Technical Context
  The "PsExec Service File Creation" detection rule is designed to identify the creation of the PsExec service executable file, specifically targeting the filename `PSEXESVC.exe`. PsExec, developed by Sysinternals, allows remote execution of commands on Windows systems, which can be leveraged by attackers for lateral movement and privilege escalation. This rule works by monitoring specific file events for the creation of `PSEXESVC.exe`, a default name associated with the PsExec service installation. The primary data sources involved in this detection are file event logs from Windows, specifically focusing on the creation of files in the system. This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Execution (T1202) and the detailed technique of "Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell" (T1569.002), highlighting the potential for misuse of legitimate tools to execute malicious actions on the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Creation Logs:** Use EDR or Windows Event Logs to search for file creation events associated with `PSEXESVC.exe` to confirm an occurrence.
  - **Identify Process Relationships:** Analyze the parent-child process relationship for the creation event using process creation logs to determine if it was spawned by a legitimate program or a potential threat.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Investigate any network activity associated with `PSEXESVC.exe` using Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to check for unauthorized outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Examine Related PowerShell Activity:** Search PowerShell logs for any commands that may have invoked PsExec or similar tools to provide context to the execution and potential misuse.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked with a low severity level, suggesting that while the creation of the PsExec service file is suspicious, it may be a common occurrence in environments where legitimate administrative tasks are performed remotely. However, additional context surrounding the file creation can elevate the level of concern.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where PsExec is not commonly used or where its execution is closely monitored and controlled. It also assumes that the monitoring of file creation events is configured correctly across endpoints. An adversary could defeat this detection by renaming the executable or using alternative tools to achieve similar execution capabilities, making detection through filename alone insufficient.

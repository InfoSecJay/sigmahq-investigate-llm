  ### Technical Context
  The PSEXEC Remote Execution File Artefact rule is designed to detect the creation of PsExec key files, which occur whenever the PsExec tool is executed on a target Windows system. PsExec is a powerful utility used for executing commands on remote systems, often leveraged in privilege escalation and lateral movement attacks. When PsExec is utilized, it generates a file with a `.key` extension at the specified path (C:\Windows\PSEXEC-<process_id>.key). This file serves as a signal that PsExec has been activated, and the action is logged in the USN Journal, which tracks changes to the file system. 
  This rule falls under several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, including Lateral Movement (T1136.002), Privilege Escalation (T1543.003), and Execution (T1570). By monitoring for the presence of these key files, SOC analysts can identify potential misuse of the PsExec utility, which could indicate that an adversary is attempting to exploit the environment for unauthorized access or control.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts**: Look for alerts on the endpoint where the PSEXEC key file was created. Correlate these alerts with the timestamp of the file creation to identify any suspicious processes that may have initiated the action.
  - **Review Security Event Logs**: Investigate Windows Security Event Logs for logon events around the time of the key file creation. Specifically, look for any unusual account activity or logins that may indicate unauthorized access.
  - **Analyze System and Application Logs**: Examine the System and Application event logs for any events related to the execution of PsExec. This can provide context about the command that was run and the account under which it was executed.
  - **Inspect USN Journal**: Query the USN Journal for entries related to the created key file. This may reveal additional information on the file's creation date, the process responsible, and any other relevant file operations that occurred.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it is crucial to treat any detection of a PSEXEC key file as a potential indicator of malicious activity or internal misuse. The ability to execute commands remotely suggests significant risk, highlighting the need for immediate investigation to prevent potential data breaches or further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the consistent logging of file events, specifically the creation of PSEXEC key files. However, if PsExec is executed in a way that circumvents logging (e.g., using built-in Windows utilities or manipulation of command-line inputs), the detection could fail. Additionally, environments with strict auditing configurations may not log this event accurately. It is also assumed that attackers may utilize less detectable methods for remote execution which will evade detection altogether. Understanding these limitations will help detection engineers in tuning this rule for better efficacy.

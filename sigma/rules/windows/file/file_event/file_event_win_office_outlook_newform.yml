  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential persistence mechanisms via Outlook forms. Specifically, it monitors for the creation of files within certain directories associated with Microsoft Outlook where forms are stored, particularly focusing on the `\AppData\Local\Microsoft\FORMS\IPM` and `\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Forms` paths. These locations are commonly exploited by threat actors who create custom Outlook forms to embed malicious code, enabling unauthorized persistence on the system. When the rule is triggered, it indicates that an Outlook process, identified by `outlook.exe`, has created a file that could potentially indicate malicious activity, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence (T1137.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Activity:** Check the EDR for the `outlook.exe` process creation and any associated parent processes to assess the context of the form creation and identify any suspicious activities leading up to the event.
  - **Analyze File Details:** Use file analysis tools to examine the newly created files in the specified paths, reviewing their headers and contents for indicators of malicious code or an unusual structure.
  - **Check User Context:** Investigate the user account that triggered the creation of the Outlook form to determine if it aligns with expected user behavior or if it appears to be an unauthorized account.
  - **Monitor for Other Indicators:** Search Security and Application event logs for additional activities related to Outlook, such as unusual login times or simultaneous access from foreign IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be considered high priority due to the potential implications of an attacker establishing persistence on a system through benign-looking applications like Outlook, increasing the risk of extended compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the creation of Outlook forms occurs via legitimate administrative tasks or if a threat actor uses methods to obfuscate the form creation process. Additionally, the rule assumes monitoring is correctly implemented and that other legitimate processes are not creating forms in these directories. If malware deletes or modifies the log files before they can be captured, or if Outlook runs with escalated privileges, such actions could evade detection.

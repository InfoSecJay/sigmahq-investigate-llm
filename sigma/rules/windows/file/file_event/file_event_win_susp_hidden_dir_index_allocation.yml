  Detects the creation of hidden file/folder with the "::$index_allocation" stream. Which can be used as a technique to prevent access to folder and files from tooling such as "explorer.exe" and "powershell.exe"

  ### Technical Context
  This rule is designed to detect the creation of hidden files or directories using the NTFS "::$INDEX_ALLOCATION" stream technique, which can obscure these files from conventional file management tools like "explorer.exe" and "powershell.exe." By utilizing special streams in NTFS, an attacker can create files or directories that remain hidden from standard file browsing utilities, making them a stealthy method for storing malicious payloads or data. The detection leverages telemetry from Windows file event logs, specifically monitoring for occurrences of the '::$INDEX_ALLOCATION' stream as part of the target filename. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1564.004), which outlines techniques adversaries may employ to hide their presence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check File Event Logs:** Review Windows file event logs for any entries related to file creation that include the string '::$INDEX_ALLOCATION', noting the context of the files created.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Use the EDR (e.g., CrowdStrike) to review any command line history or process information that may indicate how the hidden files were created or if they were accessed by malicious processes.
  - **Verify with Sysmon Logs:** Inspect Sysmon logs for additional context surrounding the file creation event, including process IDs and parent-child relationships in the process tree.
  - **Conduct Endpoint Review:** Assess affected endpoints for any anomalous behavior or patterns around file access or process execution related to the identified event.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert's medium severity level indicates a potential security risk, as hidden files can be indicative of adversarial tactics to evade detection and maintain persistence in the system. Investigating these alerts promptly is crucial for preventing potential data breaches or malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where NTFS streams are not properly logged or where the file creation is executed using authenticated administrative privileges that bypass standard logging mechanisms. Furthermore, environments lacking appropriate EDR configuration might not capture necessary context (e.g., command-line history), leading to potential missed detections. Engineers should remain aware that sophisticated adversaries could employ techniques to remove or obfuscate traces of hidden file creation.

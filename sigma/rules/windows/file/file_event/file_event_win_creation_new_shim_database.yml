title: New Custom Shim Database Created
id: ee63c85c-6d51-4d12-ad09-04e25877a947
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.
  The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "New Custom Shim Database Created" is designed to detect the creation of malicious shim database files in Windows environments. Application shims are a feature in the Microsoft Windows operating system that allows applications to run in a compatibility mode, which can be exploited by attackers to maintain persistence and potentially elevate privileges. This detection rule focuses specifically on the file events that involve the custom shim databases located in the directories 'C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\' and 'C:\Windows\apppatch\CustomSDB\'. By monitoring file creation events in these directories, the rule uncovers attempts by adversaries to leverage shims for malicious purposes, tagged under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Persistence** (T1547.009).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify File Creation Events:** Use your EDR tool to examine the file creation logs for events that correspond to new files being created in the 'C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\' or 'C:\Windows\apppatch\CustomSDB\' directories.
  - **Analyze File Metadata:** Review the details of the created shim databases, including hashes and associated processes, to determine if they are legitimate or suspicious entities.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Investigate related process creation events in Sysmon logs to establish a timeline and context for when the custom shim database was created and by which application or service.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Check firewall logs and network connection events to identify any unusual outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration or command and control (C2) activity connected to the shim database's execution.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that shim databases represent a method for attackers to establish persistence and manipulate system behavior, it is crucial to treat alerts for this rule with medium severity. Investigating these alerts promptly can help prevent potential compromise and mitigate risks before they escalate.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in instances where legitimate applications utilize custom shim databases for compatibility. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries can avoid detection by creating shim databases in non-standard directories or altering the creation patterns of these files. It assumes that file system monitoring is enabled and correctly configured to capture relevant events; thus, environments with restrictive logging practices may miss legitimate detections.

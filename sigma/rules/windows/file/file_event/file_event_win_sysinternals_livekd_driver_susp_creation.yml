  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "LiveKD Driver Creation By Uncommon Process" aims to detect potentially malicious activity through the creation of the LiveKD driver, specifically targeting the LiveKdD.SYS file in the system's drivers directory. This rule is particularly focused on instances where the driver is created by process images other than the expected "livekd.exe" or "livek64.exe." The creation of this driver by an uncommon process can indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or an evasion tactic by an adversary, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (TA0005) and the technique of "Driver Load" (T1131). The primary data source for this detection is Windows Sysmon file_event logs, tracking specific file creation actions related to driver files.
  This detection mechanism hinges on the monitoring of files and the processes associated with their creation. The rule evaluates process image names and correlates them with the event of interest, flagging instances that diverge from the norm. In environments where the LiveKD tool is legitimately used (such as for debugging or diagnostic purposes), this detection rule helps to identify any unusual or potentially harmful behavior by warning SOC analysts when a non-standard process attempts to create this driver.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Investigate any EDR alerts or logs related to the processes attempting to create the LiveKdD.SYS file. Focus on the execution paths and the command-line arguments used.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Creation Logs:** Review Sysmon process creation logs to understand the context in which the unusual process initiated the driver creation. Pay attention to parent-child relationships between processes.
  - **Review File System Activity:** Use file_event logs to identify any strange patterns or activities around C:\Windows\System32\drivers, particularly related to LiveKdD.SYS. Look for any abnormal timestamps or unexpected file modifications.
  - **Examine User Activity:** Analyze user account activity via Windows Security logs, especially looking for accounts that executed the suspicious process. Cross-reference with the user permissions to ensure proper access levels.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized privilege escalation or evasion tactics in an enterprise environment, which could lead to significant security breaches or data exfiltration.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the legitimate users rename the LiveKD executable prior to usage, which could lead to bypassing the detection. Additionally, the rule assumes that the standard naming conventions for the LiveKD driver remain intact, making it critical for detection engineers to understand the specific operational context and naming conventions within their organization. Adversaries may also employ file obfuscation techniques or similar drivers with compliant names to avoid triggering this rule, challenging detection efficacy.

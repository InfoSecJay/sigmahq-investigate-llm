  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,
    https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular. How to test detection? You can

detection:
  selection:
    PipeName|contains:
    - '\pipe\'
    - '\pipe\srvsvc'          # more specific version (use only this one if the other causes too many false positives)
  filter_optional_ctx:
    PipeName|contains: '\CtxShare'
  filter_optional_default:
    PipeName|startswith: '\pipe\'     # excludes pipes that start with \pipe\*
  condition: selection and not 1 of filter_optional_*
falsepositives:
- \pipe\LOCAL\Monitorian     # https://github.com/emoacht/Monitorian

  ### Technical Context
  The HackTool 
  - EfsPotato Named Pipe Creation rule is designed to detect the malicious behavior associated with EfsPotatoâ€”a hack tool that utilizes named pipes for privilege escalation and defense evasion. Specifically, the rule targets the creation of named pipes containing `\pipe\`, focusing on instances where pipe names relate to the Server Service (identified by `\pipe\srvsvc`) while excluding known benign uses such as those for the Monitorian application. The underlying technical data sources include Sysmon event logs, specifically Event ID 17 (Named Pipe Created) and Event ID 18 (Named Pipe Connected), which must be enabled in the Sysmon configuration to gather the necessary telemetry. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion and technique T1055 (Process Injection), indicating the use of named pipes to perform unauthorized actions on the system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs**: Review Sysmon Event ID 17 and 18 logs for named pipe creation events matching the pipe name patterns described in the rule, specifically looking for anomalies on endpoints.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data**: Use EDR tools to assess the processes associated with the detected named pipes, correlating them with process execution history to identify any suspicious activity or known hack tools.
  - **Review Process Creation Events**: Investigate Windows Event Logs for process creation events leading to the invocation of the suspicious named pipes, paying close attention to command-line arguments for additional context.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Check if there are any unusual network connections or communications that coincide with the named pipe creation events, as they may indicate lateral movement or other malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for privilege escalation and the serious implications of unauthorized access. Immediate investigation is crucial as the presence of EfsPotato can indicate an active attack on an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where Sysmon is not properly configured to log named pipe events, or if the attacker employs customized pipe names that do not conform to the specified patterns. Additionally, adversaries might utilize legitimate tools that create similar named pipes, leading to potential false positives. Analysts should be aware that persistent adversaries might obfuscate their actions or use lesser-known techniques to evade detection, which may not be covered by this rule.

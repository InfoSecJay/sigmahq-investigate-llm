  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,
    https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular. How to test detection? You can

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of default named pipes associated with RemCom, which is a remote communication tool often used for lateral movement within a network. The rule specifically looks for named pipes containing the string `\RemCom` in their names, indicating potential misuse of this feature by either legitimate administrative tasks or malicious actors. The technical data sources involved primarily include Windows Sysmon logs, specifically focusing on Pipe Created events (Event ID 18), which require proper Sysmon configuration for monitoring and management. This rule relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1021.002 (Lateral Movement: SMB/Windows Admin Shares) by identifying atypical behaviors indicative of lateral movement via named pipes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Sysmon Configuration:** Ensure that Sysmon logging is properly configured to capture Named Pipe Events (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). If the logs are missing, the detection may not trigger as intended.
  - **Check Event Details:** Investigate the identified events in Sysmon logs for the specific PipeName. Analyze the context surrounding the creation to determine if it is part of normal administrative activity or indicative of an attack.
  - **Analyze System Connectivity:** Use EDR or network logs to examine the source and destination of the process that created the named pipe. Look for unusual or unauthorized connections that could signify lateral movement attempts.
  - **Review User Activity:** Inspect user account activity to establish whether the event correlates with legitimate user actions. Look for signs of account compromise or misuse, particularly if the pipe creation happened under unexpected user contexts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as medium due to the potential risk involved with the creation of a named pipe commonly associated with remote communications, which can lead to unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network. Prompt investigation is necessary to differentiate between benign administrative actions and actual threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if Sysmon is not properly configured, particularly if Named Pipe logging is not enabled. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities might generate false positives, so distinguishing normal from malicious actions requires contextual knowledge of the environment. Adversaries may also defeat this detection by using alternate named pipe names or obfuscating their methods of lateral movement.

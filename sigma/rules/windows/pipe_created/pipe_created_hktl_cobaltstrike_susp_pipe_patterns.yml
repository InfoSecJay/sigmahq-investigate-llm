  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  The "CobaltStrike Named Pipe Patterns" detection rule aims to identify the creation of named pipes that exhibit patterns commonly associated with Cobalt Strike, a tool often utilized for adversarial command and control (C2) operations. This rule leverages data from Sysmon event logs, specifically monitoring events related to named pipe creation (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The rule looks for specific pipe names that begin with or contain known Cobalt Strike signatures, such as `\DserNamePipe` or `\mojo.5688.*`. By correlating these patterns with established logging configurations, the rule enhances visibility into potential malicious activities consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Defense Evasion (T1055 
  - Process Injection) and Privilege Escalation tactics.
  To ensure proper functionality, it is crucial that the organization has configured Sysmon to log the appropriate events for named pipes, as highlighted in the references to popular Sysmon configurations. The rule can help investigators pinpoint attempts by adversaries to establish covert communication channels through named pipes, which are less visible than traditional network traffic methods. This activity is particularly concerning in enterprise environments where such adversarial behaviors could lead to significant data breaches or other harmful outcomes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs:** Review the Sysmon named pipe events (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18) for the presence of any suspicious pipe names as reported by this rule and correlate with the time frame of the alert.
  - **Identify Related Processes:** Utilize EDR tools to trace back to the processes that created the named pipes, focusing on any anomalous behavior or deviations from typical baselines for those processes.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use network detection and response tools to check for any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration linked to the identified named pipes during the period of interest.
  - **Review System Logs:** Examine Windows Security and Application logs for any additional suspicious activity or authentication failures that might correlate with the identified pipe creation events.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level associated with this alert, it indicates a significant potential threat that could be indicative of an active exploit or ongoing malicious activity within the network. Quick investigation and response are crucial to mitigate potential harm.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not activate under certain conditions, such as if the Sysmon logging is improperly configured or if an adversary uses non-standard pipe names that do not align with the defined patterns. Furthermore, legitimate applications, like Chrome or Websense endpoints, may create named pipes that match these signatures, leading to false positives. Analysts should remain aware of these limitations and carefully cross-reference alerts with contextual information from other telemetry sources to ensure accurate threat assessment.

  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,
    https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular. How to test detection? You can
    always use Cobalt Strike, but also you can check powershell script from this site

  ### Technical Context
  The "CobaltStrike Named Pipe" detection rule is designed to identify the creation of named pipes that are indicative of Cobalt Strike operations, a popular adversary tool used for post-exploitation activities. Named pipes in Windows are a method for inter-process communication, and certain naming patterns are commonly utilized by Cobalt Strike for its modules to facilitate reconnaissance, remote access, and privilege escalation. This rule leverages Sysmon's Event IDs 17 and 18 to monitor for the creation of these named pipes, specifically looking for predefined prefixes and substrings that match Cobalt Strike's signature. The relevant data sources include Sysmon logs where named pipe events are present, indicating potential malicious activity as listed under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactic of Defense Evasion and the technique T1055, which deals with process injection and inter-process communications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Sysmon Logs:** Filter Sysmon logs for Event ID 17 and 18 to investigate the specific named pipes that have been created. Pay close attention to the naming conventions for any that match the criteria set in the detection rule.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Creation:** Cross-reference the identified named pipes with process creation logs to determine the parent processes and their command-line arguments. This context can help ascertain if the named pipes are related to established threat indicators.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Inspect alerts from your EDR solution to identify any suspicious behavior associated with the processes that created the named pipes. Look for any correlation with known indicators of compromise related to Cobalt Strike.
  - **Monitor Network Connections:** Review network traffic logs, particularly those emanating from systems that triggered the rule. Identify any unusual outbound connections that coincide with the named pipe activities, as these may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data or communicate with external entities.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is tagged with a critical severity level due to the high risk associated with the usage of Cobalt Strike in live environments. The creation of named pipes consistent with this tool is a strong indicator of potential compromise and malicious activity, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if Sysmon is not properly configured to log named pipe events, as required by Event ID 17 and Event ID 18. Additionally, adversaries may employ evasion techniques by using different naming conventions for pipes or may disable Sysmon logging altogether to avoid detection. It assumes that defenders maintain an up-to-date Sysmon configuration aligned with current best practices, as per the specified repositories.

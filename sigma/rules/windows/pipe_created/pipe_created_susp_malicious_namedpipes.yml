  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,
    https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular. How to test detection? You can

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule, titled "Malicious Named Pipe Created," is designed to identify the creation of named pipes, which are communication channels that can be exploited by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and malware for various malicious activities. It specifically targets a predefined list of named pipes associated with known nefarious entities and tactics leveraging named pipes for communication and privilege escalation. 
  The rule relies on Event IDs 17 and 18 from Sysmon for its detection, which must be configured correctly in the Sysmon configuration files to ensure that named pipe events are logged. When a named pipe that matches any of the specified patterns is created, the rule fires an alert. This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055, which pertains to “Process Injection,” often used for privilege escalation and evasion in advanced attacks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs**: Immediately review the Sysmon logs (Event ID 17) for the creation of the detected named pipe. Analyze the originating process and its command-line arguments for any suspicious activity that may provide context regarding the alert.
  - **Correlate with EDR Events**: Utilize EDR solutions to correlate the time of the named pipe creation with any other suspicious activities (e.g., unauthorized access attempts, abnormal process behavior) in the environment that could indicate a larger compromise.
  - **Examine Network Traffic**: Investigate any related network connections using your NDR or firewall logs to determine if suspicious connections correlate with the time of the alert. Look for outbound connections to suspicious domains or IP addresses.
  - **Review User Activities**: Check user activity logs and authentication records to ascertain whether legitimate users were involved in activities leading to the creation of the named pipe. Look for unusual login times or locations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as "critical" because named pipes are frequently utilized as a method for executing malicious code and establishing communication channels between compromised systems. If detected in the enterprise environment, it signifies a potential active threat that warrants immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in cases where the named pipe creation does not match the predefined list or is dynamically generated by the adversary. Additionally, if Sysmon logging for named pipe events is not configured appropriately, the rule will not trigger. Furthermore, malicious actors may use evasion techniques such as altering named pipe names or creating bespoke named pipes to bypass detection frameworks.

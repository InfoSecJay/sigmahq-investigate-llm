  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of well-known credential dumping tools by monitoring the creation of specific named pipes commonly used in these attacks within Windows environments. It leverages Sysmon event IDs 17 and 18, which log named pipe creation events. The rule specifically looks for named pipes that include keywords such as `\cachedump`, `\lsadump`, and `\wceservicepipe`, which are characteristic of tools that exfiltrate credentials from memory or system processes. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, specifically under the tactics of Credential Access (TA0006) and techniques T1003.001, T1003.002, T1003.004, and T1003.005. By monitoring these indicators, analysts can identify potential unauthorized access attempts and respond to credential theft incidents swiftly.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Named Pipe Events**: Utilize Sysmon logs to examine event ID 17 and 18 for any recently created named pipes matching the specified patterns. Look for any anomalous activity or unauthorized applications involved.
  - **Correlate Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to find the associated process creation logs linked to the named pipe events. Identify the parent processes and verify the legitimacy of the executing binaries.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts**: Investigate any alerts triggered by your EDR solution regarding credential dumping tools or any behavior consistent with credential access. Review the timeline of actions taken by identified processes.
  - **Check Network Activities**: Review firewall and network connection logs for any suspicious outbound communication from the identified processes. Correlate any indication of data exfiltration, especially after the named pipe events.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as critical due to the high risk of credential theft, which can lead to further compromised accounts and access within the organization. Timely and effective response is essential to mitigate potential escalations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if named pipe logging is not correctly configured within Sysmon. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities using similar named pipes for password recovery could lead to false positives, suggesting that some benign usage patterns could evade detection. Attackers may employ custom names for their pipes or obfuscate their tool's execution method, leading to potential evasion of this detection rule.

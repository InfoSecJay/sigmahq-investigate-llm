  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - CoercedPotato Named Pipe Creation" is designed to detect the use of named pipes associated with the CoercedPotato hacking tool, which is commonly employed for privilege escalation and defense evasion tactics. This rule specifically looks for named pipe creations with the substring `\coerced\`. In a Windows environment, the data sources relevant to this detection include Sysmon logs, specifically Event ID 17 (Named Pipe Created) and Event ID 18 (Named Pipe Closed), which facilitate monitoring of named pipe operations. By establishing a baseline of normal named pipe usage in the environment, this detection can help identify potentially malicious activities aligned with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055, related to process injection and exploitation of system-level functions.
  The detection focuses on the behavioral patterns that signal an attempted exploitation of named pipes, often circumventing traditional security measures. Given the covert nature of tools like CoercedPotato, understanding the presence and nature of these named pipes can provide critical insights into intrusions or lateral movements within an enterprise system, thereby enabling effective threat mitigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs for Named Pipe Creation Events:** Review Sysmon logs, specifically Event ID 17, for any entries indicating the creation of named pipes containing `\coerced\`, and note the associated processes and parent processes.
  - **Analyze Process Tree with EDR:** Utilize your EDR tool to examine the process tree for the detected pipe creation event. Look for any anomalous parent-child relationships and cross-reference with known good processes.
  - **Review Event Logs for Any Related Artifacts:** Check Windows Security and Application logs around the time of the detected alert for any related events that indicate suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or application behavior that seems out of the ordinary.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs from NDR or proxy logs for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts that may correlate with the timeline of the named pipe event, providing context for potential lateral movement.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is classified as high due to the potential threat posed by the CoercedPotato tool, which is known to facilitate privilege escalation and circumvent security controls. Quick identification and response are crucial to mitigate risks associated with advanced persistent threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that Sysmon is correctly configured to log named pipe events; without this configuration, the rule may fail to trigger. Additionally, attackers may implement evasion tactics, such as using randomized pipe names, to avoid detection. False positives may arise from legitimate applications that use similar naming conventions for their named pipes, so it's essential for analysts to validate context and collation of other telemetry before concluding malicious intent.

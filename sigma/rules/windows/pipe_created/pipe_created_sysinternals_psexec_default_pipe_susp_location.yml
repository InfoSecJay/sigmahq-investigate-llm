  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious usage of the PsExec tool, specifically focusing on instances where the PsExec service pipe (`\PSEXESVC`) is created from locations deemed suspicious, such as `C:\Users\Public\`, `C:\Windows\Temp\`, `C:\AppData\Local\Temp\`, `C:\Desktop\`, and `C:\Downloads\`. It aims to identify behaviors that may indicate an attacker is using PsExec for lateral movement or executing payloads on a compromised host within an enterprise environment. This detection primarily relies on Windows Sysmon logs, specifically monitoring named pipe creation events (Event IDs 17 and 18). Given that PsExec is a legitimate tool often leveraged by system administrators for remote process execution, its usage from these particular locations can be a strong indicator of malicious activity in accordance with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1569.002 (Remote Services: PsExec) and tactic TA0002 (Execution).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs:** Review Sysmon logs for Event ID 17 and Event ID 18 focusing on the creation of the pipe named `\PSEXESVC` from the suspicious paths listed in the rule to identify potential unauthorized usage.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Events:** Utilize EDR tools to trace process creation logs in conjunction with the Sysmon alerts to gather information on what processes were executed using PsExec and their parent-child relationships.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Investigate any associated network activity using the SIEM or NDR tools to determine if there are unusual outbound connections correlating with the PsExec execution timestamp.
  - **Assess User Activities:** Examine the user accounts responsible for the PsExec executions, reviewing user activity logs to identify if they deviated from standard behavior or were executed by accounts with unusual access levels.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level, as the detection of PsExec usage from suspicious locations often indicates potentially malicious behavior but may also reflect rare legitimate administrative tasks. Investigators should assess the context of the alert to prioritize their response accordingly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if PsExec is executed from non-suspicious locations that are still permissible within the environment. It also assumes appropriate logging is configured for Sysmon (Event IDs 17 and 18). An adversary could mitigate detection by using less suspicious paths or renaming the executable, thus evading the rule. Additionally, the effectiveness of this rule may be impacted if an organization has frequent legitimate usages of PsExec from the highlighted paths, necessitating further tuning.

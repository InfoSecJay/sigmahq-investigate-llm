  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - Koh Default Named Pipe" is designed to detect the creation of default named pipes typically utilized by the Koh tool. Named pipes are a method for inter-process communication in Windows, allowing processes to communicate with one another. In this case, the rule specifically monitors for named pipes that contain the strings `\imposecost` and `\imposingcost`, which are indicators associated with the Koh tool. The rule requires logging for Named Pipe Events to be configured in Sysmon (specifically Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). By leveraging these Sysmon events, analysts can identify potentially malicious activities that may relate to privilege escalation (MITRE ATT&CK tactic: Privilege Escalation, technique T1134.001) or credential access (T1528). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Events:** Start by examining Sysmon logs for Event ID 17 (Named Pipe) and Event ID 18 (Named Pipe connected) to identify any instances of the detected named pipes.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to search for process creation logs around the time the named pipes were detected to ascertain which processes were associated with the pipe creation.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Investigate any associated network connections that were established by the identified processes to confirm communication with external or suspicious hosts.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Look for additional alerts related to privilege escalation or credential access that may provide contextual evidence supporting the suspicion of malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified with a critical severity level due to the potential for significant impact from privilege escalation or credential theft that could compromise sensitive systems or data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if Sysmon logging for named pipes is not properly configured or if the attacker employs different named pipe naming conventions that do not include the specific keywords monitored by this detection. Additionally, it assumes that the environment has not been compromised in a manner that obfuscates or prevents the logging of process activities. It is crucial for detection engineers to ensure comprehensive logging practices are enforced and reviewed regularly to mitigate these risks.

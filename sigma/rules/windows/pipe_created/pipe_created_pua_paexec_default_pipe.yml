  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - PAExec Default Named Pipe" focuses on detecting the use of a default named pipe associated with the PAExec tool, which is commonly used for executing commands on remote systems in a Windows environment. PAExec operates similarly to PsExec but can be leveraged by attackers to carry out malicious activities such as executing payloads on compromised machines. The rule specifically looks for named pipes starting with the prefix `\PAExec`, which indicates potential suspicious activity linked to the execution of commands or scripts remotely. To effectively log and monitor for this activity, Sysmon must be configured to capture named pipe events (Event ID 17 for created pipes and Event ID 18 for pipe events). This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the execution tactic (T1569.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate Sysmon Logs**: Check Sysmon Event ID 17 and Event ID 18 logs for any recent entries involving named pipes starting with `\PAExec`. Validate the context and time of these events against known activity patterns in your environment.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts**: Review your EDR solution for any alerts or actions taken around the same timeframe as the detected named pipe creation, focusing on process creation events that may be intertwined with the suspicious activity.
  - **Review PowerShell Activity**: Analyze PowerShell logs for any commands or scripts executed that may reference PAExec. Command-line parameters can provide insight into the actions performed when the named pipe was used.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Utilize network devices or NDR tools to inspect outbound connections made around the time of the alert. Look for any unusual connections that could correlate with the suspicious use of PAExec.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is given a medium severity level as although it identifies potentially malicious usage of a legitimate tool, additional context is required to determine if it constitutes an actual threat or requires further investigation within the specific environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized issue is that if the Sysmon logging for named pipes is not set up properly, this rule may fail to trigger, leading to missed detection of suspicious activities. Furthermore, if an adversary modifies the named pipe's name to avoid detection (e.g., using a different prefix), the rule will not fire. It's essential to ensure that robust logging and monitoring practices are in place and that the defined naming conventions are reviewed periodically to minimize evasion tactics.

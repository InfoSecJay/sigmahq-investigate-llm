  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - DiagTrackEoP Default Named Pipe" is designed to detect the creation of a default named pipe associated with the **DiagTrackEoP** proof-of-concept (PoC) tool, which exploits the "SeImpersonate" privilege in a Windows environment. This pipe, named 'thisispipe', is a unique identifier within the system that indicates potential malicious activity related to privilege escalation tactics. The rule captures specific events generated by Windows Sysmon, particularly focusing on named pipe creation activities (Event ID 17), which must be configured in Sysmon logging settings. By monitoring these named pipe events, analysts can identify unauthorized attempts to escalate privileges, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of privilege escalation and technique.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Sysmon Configuration**: Ensure Sysmon is correctly configured to log named pipe events (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18) to capture the necessary data for analysis.
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Use your EDR solution to check for alerts related to the process that attempts to create the named pipe, ensuring that it has not been previously flagged for suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Events**: Investigate the process creation logs to track the execution path of the application that triggered the named pipe creation, paying close attention to its command-line arguments and parent-child relationships.
  - **Inspect Related Network Connections**: Investigate any associated network connections that may have occurred around the same timestamp to establish if there was external communication or lateral movement attempts related to the detected pipe activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as critical due to the potential for privilege escalation, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. In an enterprise environment, such activity poses a significant risk, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that Sysmon is correctly configured to log the relevant named pipe events and that the 'thisispipe' string is indicative of malicious activity associated with the DiagTrackEoP tool. It's possible that legitimate applications may also create similarly named pipes, leading to false positives. Additionally, if adversaries modify their tool to use different pipe names or remove logging capabilities, this detection may fail to trigger. Analysts should remain aware of these potential limitations and consider contextual factors around any alerts.

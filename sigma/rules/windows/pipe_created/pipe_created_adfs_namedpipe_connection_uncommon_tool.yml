title: ADFS Database Named Pipe Connection By Uncommon Tool
id: 1ea13e8c-03ea-409b-877d-ce5c3d2c1cb3
status: test
description: |
  Detects suspicious local connections via a named pipe to the AD FS configuration database (Windows Internal Database).
  Used to access information such as the AD FS configuration settings which contains sensitive information used to sign SAML tokens.

  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects suspicious named pipe connections to the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) configuration database, specifically targeting connections made using tools that are not typically associated with legitimate ADFS operations. ADFS operates on a Windows Internal Database (WID) that holds sensitive configurations, including settings for signing SAML tokens. The rule focuses on monitoring specific named pipe connections (`\MICROSOFT##WID\tsql\query`) which can potentially expose sensitive information when accessed by unauthorized or uncommon applications. To effectively utilize this detection, organizations must ensure that appropriate logging is enabled in Sysmon, particularly for named pipe events (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1005 (Data from Local System), indicating an attempt to collect sensitive data from the system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Inspect Named Pipe Logs**: Use Sysmon logs to locate Event IDs 17 and 18, filtering for entries that match the named pipe in question. Analyze the source applications to determine if they are legitimate or if they represent a security concern. 
  - **Validate Process Origin**: Check the execution paths of the processes associated with the named pipe connections using EDR tools to verify if the processes are running from expected directories or if they appear suspicious.
  - **Cross-Reference with Security Events**: Review Windows Security and Application logs for any correlated events that may indicate unauthorized access to the ADFS database. Look for unusual user activity or failures tied to the same timeframe.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Analyze any outbound connections related to the detected named pipe activities using NDR or Firewall logs to identify if the application attempted to exfiltrate data or communicate with external systems.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential unauthorized access to sensitive ADFS configuration data, which could lead to further exploitation or credential theft if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where named pipe logging is not properly configured or if legitimate applications are misidentified as uncommon tools. Additionally, if the malicious actor utilizes approved tools that inherently use named pipes for legitimate purposes, the detection may fail. It is assumed that the standard operations are not heavily modified, and any new, legitimate processes may need to be continuously assessed for their behavior in the context of ADFS interactions.

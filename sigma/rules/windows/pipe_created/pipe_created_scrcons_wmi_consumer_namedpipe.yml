  definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the creation of named pipes by the WMI Event Consumer service, specifically the executable `scrcons.exe`. Named pipes are a form of inter-process communication that can be exploited by adversaries to facilitate command and control (C2) communications, especially by malware such as Cobalt Strike. The detection is based on monitoring telemetry logs from Windows Sysmon, specifically focusing on events generated when named pipes are created (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation), as it identifies suspicious utilization of WMI for potentially malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Sysmon Logs**: Check Windows Sysmon logs for Event ID 17 and Event ID 18 to confirm the creation of named pipes by `scrcons.exe`. Ensure that logging for named pipe events is properly configured.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts**: Utilize Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to investigate the endpoint associated with the alert. Look for any other suspicious processes or anomalies in recent activity.
  - **Inspect Process Behavior**: Analyze the behavior of `scrcons.exe` and any related processes using process creation logs. Check command-line parameters and other events indicating unusual activity around the time of the named pipe creation.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Look for any network connection attempts made by `scrcons.exe` or its children processes to identify potential command and control (C2) communications. Utilize network logs from the NGFW and NDR to correlate findings.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level rated as "medium" indicates that while the use of `scrcons.exe` creating named pipes is not uncommon for legitimate administrative tasks, its association with potential malicious activity warrants prompt investigation to rule out any security incidents.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several potential blind spots with this detection rule. The rule may not fire if Sysmon is not configured to log named pipe events correctly, as required by the specified event IDs. Additionally, legitimate use of `scrcons.exe` by system administrators could lead to false positives if not contextualized. An adversary might also defeat this detection by using a different executable name or leveraging alternative methods for inter-process communication that do not utilize named pipes.

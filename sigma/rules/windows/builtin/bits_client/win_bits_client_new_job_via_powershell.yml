  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of a new Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) job through PowerShell commands. BITS is often exploited by adversaries for stealthy data exfiltration or lateral movement within a network. The rule specifically looks for Windows Event ID 3, which indicates that a new BITS job has been created. It also monitors commands executed via PowerShell (either `powershell.exe` or the cross-platform `pwsh.exe`) to catch potentially malicious activities. PowerShell is a common tool in the attackerâ€™s arsenal due to its powerful scripting capabilities, which can be easily leveraged for malicious purposes if not monitored carefully. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the EDR logs for any recent PowerShell command executions that correspond to Event ID 3, focusing on the command-line parameters used to create BITS jobs.
  - Investigate the user account associated with the PowerShell execution to determine if it is a standard user or an administrative account and check its recent activities for signs of compromise.
  - Correlate the timestamps of the BITS job creation with any logs from the SIEM related to network traffic, examining for any unusual outbound connections or data transfers.
  - Check the AV logs for any alerts triggered during the time frame of the suspicious PowerShell execution to see if any associated malicious activity has been detected.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Pass the Hash Activity 2" Sigma rule is designed to detect lateral movement attacks facilitated through the Pass-the-Hash (PtH) technique. In these attacks, an adversary utilizes stolen hash credentials to authenticate across multiple systems within the network without needing to capture or know the plain-text password. The rule specifically looks for Windows Security Event ID 4624, which documents successful user logon attempts. It monitors for two specific logon scenarios (Logon Type 3 
  - Network and Logon Type 9 
  - New Credentials) where the Logon Process Name may indicate unusual behavior (e.g., 'NtLmSsp' or 'seclogo') typically associated with PtH activity. The ruleâ€™s logic also checks for non-standard logon accounts like 'ANONYMOUS LOGON' to filter out benign administrative tasks, focusing the investigation on potential unauthorized access.
  This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1550.002 (Pass-the-Hash) under the tactic of lateral movement. By leveraging logs from the Windows Security service, analysts can identify suspicious activity that could indicate a security breach or ongoing attack.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs**: Use Windows Security logs to find Event ID 4624 entries that match the criteria established by this rule, focusing on the relevant Logon Types and Process Names.
  - **Review User Account Activity**: Investigate the accounts listed as the TargetUserName in correlated events to determine if any unauthorized users or anomalies are present.
  - **Cross-reference with EDR Data**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze the processes running during the times of the alerts; look for signs of credential theft or other dubious behaviors.
  - **Conduct Network Traffic Analysis**: Examine network logs from EDR, NDR, or proxies to identify any unusual outbound connections that correspond with the timing of the detected logon events.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity, as Pass-the-Hash techniques indicate an active attempt to exploit trust relationships within the network. While it could involve legitimate administrative actions, the context of such logon methods usually signifies a significant security risk that necessitates prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where the attacker uses alternate methods of lateral movement, such as exploiting other protocols or utilizing legitimate administrative accounts, which could camouflage their activities. Further, environments that employ strong security measures, such as multi-factor authentication or sophisticated endpoint protections, may mitigate the effectiveness of Pass-the-Hash attacks, leading to fewer triggered alerts. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate administrative actions or automated processes that fit the specified criteria.

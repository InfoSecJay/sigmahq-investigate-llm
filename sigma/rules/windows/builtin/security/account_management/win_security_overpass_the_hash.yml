  ### Technical Context
  The "Successful Overpass the Hash Attempt" detection rule identifies unauthorized access attempts that utilize the Overpass-the-Hash technique, commonly associated with tools like Mimikatz. This technique leverages the ability to authenticate without a plaintext password by using a hashed version of a user's credentials. The rule specifically looks for successful logon events (Event ID 4624) with a Logon Type of 9 (NewCredentials) that occur via the "seclogo" logon process using the "Negotiate" authentication package. These characteristics indicate that an attacker is likely using compromised credentials to perform lateral movements within a network. This activity falls under MITRE ATT&CK technique T1550.002, which pertains to the use of new credentials to access systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Logon Events:** Check Windows Security event logs for Event ID 4624 entries to identify the specific accounts, source IP addresses, and timestamps associated with the successful logon attempts.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze any associated processes or network connections initiated by the account to determine if malicious activity followed the logon.
  - **Examine User Behavior:** Investigate the userâ€™s recent activities and logon patterns for any anomalies that might indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized access.
  - **Alert on Related Indicators:** Monitor for additional alerts related to lateral movement or privilege escalation that may indicate the continuation of the attacker's actions post-logon.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert signifies a successful authentication using potentially stolen credentials, it poses a high severity risk to the enterprise. Immediate investigation is essential to prevent potential lateral movement and further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger on legitimate use cases, such as when the Runas command is executed with the `/netonly` parameter, which is a known false positive. Additionally, environments with various authentication mechanisms or poorly configured logging may fail to capture the necessary Event ID 4624. Operators should also consider that advanced adversaries may employ techniques to evade detection, such as using different logon processes or authentication packages not covered in this rule.

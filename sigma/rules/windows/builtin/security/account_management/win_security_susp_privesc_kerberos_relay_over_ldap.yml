title: Potential Privilege Escalation via Local Kerberos Relay over LDAP
id: 749c9f5e-b353-4b90-a9c1-05243357ca4b
status: test
description: |
  Detects a suspicious local successful logon event where the Logon Package is Kerberos, the remote address is set to localhost, and the target user SID is the built-in local Administrator account.
  This may indicate an attempt to leverage a Kerberos relay attack variant that can be used to elevate privilege locally from a domain joined limited user to local System privileges.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule analyzes Windows Security log events to identify a potential privilege escalation technique leveraging Kerberos in a local context. The rule specifically targets successful logon events (Event ID 4624) where the logon type is set to 3 (network logon), and the authentication package is Kerberos. It also filters for logins originating from the localhost (IP address 127.0.0.1) and checks if the target user is the built-in local Administrator account (SID ending in -500). This combination of parameters may indicate a Kerberos relay attack, which raises the risk of unauthorized elevation to system-level privileges from a domain-joined user with limited rights. The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of privilege escalation (T1548) and credential access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Logon Event:** Use Windows Security logs to locate Event ID 4624 and confirm the logon details match the parameters defined in the alert (specifically `LogonType: 3` and `AuthenticationPackageName: 'Kerberos'`).
  - **Check User Context:** Investigate the context of the user who triggered the alert, reviewing their recent activities, access levels, and any strange logon attempts leading up to the event.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Use EDR tools to inspect the actions taken by the local Administrator account following the suspicious logon, focusing on process creations and network connections for anomalies.
  - **Examine Audit Logs:** Search through Windows audit logs and Sysmon logs to identify other related activities or patterns that may have occurred around the time of the suspicious logon.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is categorized as high because local privilege escalation can lead to significant security breaches, enabling attackers to gain extensive access and control over sensitive systems and data.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where local logon events occur from non-local addresses or when the logon type differs from the specified criteria. It assumes that the logging level is adequately set to capture security events, and if logging is inadequate or disabled, the detection might fail. Additionally, adversaries could use methods to spoof logon events or tamper with logs, potentially causing this detection to be bypassed.

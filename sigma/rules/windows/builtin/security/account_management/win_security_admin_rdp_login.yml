  ### Technical Context
  The "Admin User Remote Logon" rule is designed to detect remote logon attempts made by administrator accounts in a Windows environment, particularly focusing on events that align with internal policies regarding the use of administrative accounts. Specifically, the rule monitors Windows Security Event ID 4624, which pertains to successful logon attempts. The detection logic checks for LogonType 10, denoting remote interactive logons, and filters for targeting usernames that start with "Admin", using the Negotiate authentication package. This highlights potential lateral movement activities as defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of Initial Access and Lateral Movement, specifically techniques T1078 (Valid Accounts) and its various sub-techniques. By leveraging this rule, SOC analysts can quickly identify unusual or unauthorized administrative access attempts that might indicate compromised credentials or policy violations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Logon Events:** Review the Windows Security event log for additional context surrounding the Event ID 4624 including previous and subsequent logon events logged from the same or different source IPs to identify patterns or anomalies.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool to investigate the endpoint activity for the administrator account, focusing on process creation events and any suspicious command-line parameters that may indicate unauthorized activity.
  - **Examine Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs from your firewall or proxy to identify the source IP address of the remote logon attempt and assess whether this activity aligns with known and trusted internal IP ranges.
  - **Review Admin Account Policies:** Consult internal documentation and policies regarding the use of administrative accounts to verify compliance and determine if the detected logon aligns with expected behavior for those accounts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered low severity because it may represent legitimate administrative activities, particularly in environments where remote management practices are common. However, it still warrants investigation to ensure it does not indicate unauthorized access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that all administrator accounts follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., starting with “Admin”), which may not be the case in every environment, leading to potential missed detections. Additionally, if an attacker uses legitimate credentials obtained through phishing or other means, this rule may not trigger as expected. The effectiveness of the rule is also contingent on the proper logging and auditing configuration of Windows security events.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify attempts to exploit the CVE-2019-0708 vulnerability, known as "BlueKeep," through the use of a scanning tool created by the user zerosum0x0. The specific focus of this rule is on failed login attempts captured in Windows Security Event Log (Event ID 4625), indicating potential reconnaissance activities targeting machines vulnerable to this remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Remote Desktop Services. When legitimate users fail to log in to a system multiple times, it may suggest malicious actors probing environments for exploitable RDP services. This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of lateral movement and specifically leverages the technique T1210 to identify anomalous login behaviors that warrant further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Details:** Examine the specific instance of Event ID 4625 in the Windows Security logs to gather information on the source IP address, timestamp, and the targeted hostname for deeper context.
  - **Cross-reference with EDR Data:** Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to look for any related processes or behaviors associated with the detected source IP that could indicate further malicious activity on the endpoint.
  - **Investigate Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs from your NDR or firewall to identify any unusual RDP connection attempts originating from the reported source IP, which may indicate extensive scanning and possible exploitation attempts.
  - **Monitor for Further Symptoms:** Check for additional logs regarding successful RDP connections following the failed attempts, as this may suggest potential lateral movement or exploitation attempts on vulnerable machines.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is deemed high due to the critical nature of CVE-2019-0708, which allows remote code execution. Given the potential for widespread exploitation, timely investigation is crucial to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that vulnerable systems are configured to generate relevant security logs for failed login attempts and that logs are retained for sufficient duration. It may not fire in environments lacking proper monitoring configurations or where login attempts are obscured via obfuscation or other evasion techniques. Additionally, if adversaries have already established footholds within the network, they may not trigger these alerts by using valid credentials.

  ### Technical Context
  The RottenPotato-like attack pattern is designed to detect suspicious logon events on Windows systems that exhibit behaviors consistent with local privilege escalation attacks, particularly those leveraging the 'ANONYMOUS LOGON' username. The rule focuses on identifying events captured by the Windows Security log, specifically Event ID 4624, which indicates a successful logon attempt. It looks for Logon Type 3 (network logon) where the Workstation Name is empty, typically denoting a connection made from the local machine itself. The primary goal of this detection is to identify potential unauthorized access attempts by monitoring for logins that originate from localhost (IP addresses 127.0.0.1 or ::1), indicating a higher likelihood of exploitation. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1557.001: ‘Credential Dumping: Credential API Hooking’, which encompasses techniques for gaining unauthorized access through manipulation of authentication processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the Windows Security event logs for Event ID 4624 that match the criteria specified in the rule. Pay attention to any unusual patterns or timings of these logon attempts.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize the EDR solution to assess the context of the processes running at the time of the logon event. Investigate any processes that may be related to credential theft or exploitation techniques.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Investigate the originating network connections around the time of the logon event. Check for any unusual outbound connections that may suggest data exfiltration or lateral movement following the logon attempt.
  - **Verify User Accounts:** Confirm with account management logs whether the 'ANONYMOUS LOGON' was expected versus if it reflects anomalous behavior. Particularly focus on the potential misuse of service accounts or local administrative privileges.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity level due to the inherent risks associated with unauthorized logon attempts using anonymous credentials, which could indicate a serious security incident involving privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One primary blind spot in this rule is the reliance on specific logon characteristics, which could potentially be manipulated by an adversary using techniques such as spoofing. Additionally, if the environment has strict local security policies or rigorous monitoring for anonymous logons, the alerts may generate false negatives due to a lack of visibility into certain security configurations or variations in normal user behavior patterns. Finally, there is an assumption that all relevant event data is being captured accurately; if any event logs are missing or if log retention policies are too aggressive, this rule may not fire as intended.

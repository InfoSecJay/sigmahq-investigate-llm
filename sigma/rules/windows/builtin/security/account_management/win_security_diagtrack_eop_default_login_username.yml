  ### Technical Context
  The rule "DiagTrackEoP Default Login Username" is designed to detect instances of privilege escalation through the identification of the default username "thisisnotvaliduser" used by the DiagTrackEoP proof of concept (PoC). The detection focuses specifically on Windows Security Event Log entries with Event ID 4624, which represent a successful logon event. The rule targets Logon Type 9, typically associated with a service or batch logon which might be exploited by attackers leveraging services that improperly configured that could provide higher privileges. This detection fits into the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic 'Privilege Escalation' and technique 'Exploitation of Vulnerability' (T1068), as it addresses the misuse of default credentials to gain elevated access within the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Event Logs:** Start by analyzing the Security Event Logs (Event ID 4624) for the specified logon type and username. Ensure to assess the corresponding timestamps and source IP addresses for any anomalies.
  - **Cross-reference with Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR to cross-reference any process creation associated with the logon events. Look for any executables that may have been launched by the anomalous logon event, indicating potential malicious activity.
  - **Audit Privileged Accounts and Credentials:** Examine the account configurations to confirm that public defaults are not in use. Investigate other accounts with similar naming conventions or privileges to mitigate risk.
  - **Monitor for Related Network Activity:** Check network traffic logs for outbound connections that may correlate with the flagged logon events. Suspicious activities, such as connections to unknown hosts or unusual ports, should be investigated further.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as critical, as the detection of default credentials indicating a successful logon can often signal an initial stage of a more extensive compromise or an advanced persistent threat (APT) attempting to escalate privileges within the network.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the Windows Security logs are adequately configured to capture Event ID 4624, and that the environment is not using alternative configurations that might not trigger this detection. It may fail to fire if this specific logon is performed without relevant changes made to the username by an adversary, or if another account is used to exploit similar weaknesses. Adversaries may replicate or use legitimate credentials to bypass this rule, thus making additional detection measures necessary.

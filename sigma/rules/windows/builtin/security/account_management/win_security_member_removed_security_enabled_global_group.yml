  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify instances where a member is removed from a security-enabled global group within a Windows environment. It specifically monitors Windows Security Event IDs 633 and 4729, which indicate that a member's account has been removed from a security group. This type of activity can signify unauthorized changes to user permissions, thereby raising potential security concerns. The rule leverages Windows Security logs, which capture significant changes regarding user accounts and their roles within active directory groups. Understanding this information is essential since changes to user permissions can be exploited by an attacker for lateral movement or privilege escalation. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework technique T1098 (Account Manipulation) under the persistence tactic, indicating its relevance in detecting potentially malicious changes to account configurations.
    
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check User Access Logs:** Review logs from your identity and access management tools to check if the removal of the group member was authorized. Analyze the timestamps and correlate them with contextual user actions.
  - **Review Security Logs:** Dive into Windows Security logs (Event ID 4729 or 633) using your SIEM to gather more context about the user removal event. Note which user executed the removal and any related activities around that time.
  - **Examine Group Membership Changes:** Use Active Directory tools or PowerShell commands to audit group memberships for the affected groups. Confirm whether there have been any other recent changes that could indicate a trend or target.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Check for other security alerts or anomalies in your EDR, such as unusual login attempts, which could indicate an ongoing attack. Correlating events can help identify the broader context and intent behind this activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential implications for unauthorized access and privilege escalation, this alert is classified as low severity. However, it should not be overlooked, as it may indicate attempts to alter user privileges that could lead to larger security incidents.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the account removal is executed through non-standard methods, such as service accounts or scripts that obfuscate event logging. Additionally, if the security logging settings are not properly configured, some relevant events may not be captured. Therefore, it is essential for detection engineers to ensure that logging policies are up-to-date and adequately capture the necessary events to avoid missing critical changes in account management.

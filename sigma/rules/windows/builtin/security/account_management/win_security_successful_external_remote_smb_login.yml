  ### Technical Context
  The rule "External Remote SMB Logon from Public IP" is designed to detect successful logon attempts to Windows systems via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol from external public IP addresses. Specifically, it looks for events logged under Windows Security Event ID 4624, which indicates a successful login. It focuses on LogonType 3, which is used for network logons, allowing administrators to identify unauthorized access attempts from outside their internal network. The rule incorporates filtering to exclude IP addresses from specified private ranges, ensuring that only connections from public IP addresses are flagged. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Initial Access (TA0001) and Credential Access (TA0006), particularly techniques T1133 (External Remote Services) and T1078 (Valid Accounts).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Event Log:** Use EDR tools to analyze Event ID 4624 entries to verify the source of the logon attempts, focusing particularly on any public IP addresses that have logged in.
  - **Cross-reference Events:** Check Windows Firewall logs or NGFW logs for any connections from the flagged public IP addresses to determine if they were part of legitimate business activities.
  - **Assess Authentication Source:** Investigate any related logs from the domain controller to examine the accounts used for these logons and correlate the timestamps with other activities.
  - **Evaluate User Activity:** Utilize PowerShell command logs within the SIEM to identify any subsequent actions by the logged-in user for evidence of malicious activity after the initial logon.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity due to the potential exposure of SMB services to the internet, indicating possible unauthorized access attempts that could lead to further compromise within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if multi-factor authentication or strong access controls are in place, which could prevent unauthorized access despite attempts from public IP addresses. Additionally, the rule assumes that external access via SMB is not a common legitimate practice within the organization. There may be situations where legitimate users access SMB services remotely; thus, further context is essential to avoid false positives and ensure accurate assessment.

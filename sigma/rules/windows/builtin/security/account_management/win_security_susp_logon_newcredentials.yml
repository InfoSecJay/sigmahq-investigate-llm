  ### Technical Context
  The "Outgoing Logon with New Credentials" detection rule is designed to identify logon events that involve the use of new credentials by tracking specific Windows Security Event ID 4624, which represents successful logon attempts. This rule focuses on identifying Logon Type 9, which signifies a remote interactive logon. When an attacker uses a legitimate userâ€™s credentials to establish access from a remote location, this can indicate lateral movement and potential malicious activity, aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1550 (Use Alternate Authentication Material). The data sources primarily involved are Windows Security Event Logs, wherein these logon events are captured and can be analyzed for indicators of potentially unauthorized access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4624, focusing on Logon Type 9 events to identify the user, source IP address, and timestamps of the logon attempt.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize the EDR tool to determine whether any suspicious activity was happening at the time of the logon event, looking for unusual process creations or command-line executions.
  - **Verify Validity of Credentials:** Cross-reference the credentials used in the logon with known user account activities to confirm if this was a legitimate attempt or potentially an adversary.
  - **Examine Remote Sessions:** Investigate any related remote connections (e.g., RDP or VPN logs) through the firewall or VPN tools to assess if the source IP has exhibited known malicious behavior or is associated with unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as low severity because it may capture both legitimate remote administration activities as well as potential malicious behavior. However, in an enterprise environment, any unusual use of new credentials warrants investigation to prevent unauthorized access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are some scenarios where this rule may not fire, including if the logon happens without the new credentials being specified (e.g., using existing cached credentials). Additionally, this rule assumes that security logging is adequately configured on the endpoints; if logs are not being captured or retained, the detection may be ineffective. Adversaries may also employ tactics to obfuscate their actions, such as using legitimate accounts during the initial access phase, which could lead to a lack of alert triggering.

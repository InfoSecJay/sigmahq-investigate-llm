  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect successful Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logon attempts originating from public IP addresses. The core of the detection relies on analyzing Windows Security Event Log entries, specifically Event ID 4624, which indicates a successful logon. This logon event is filtered for LogonType 10, specifically used for RDP logons, and excludes connections from local or other private IP address ranges to identify potentially unauthorized access attempts. By focusing on connections from public IP addresses, organizations can better assess the security posture of their RDP services, particularly if they are exposed to the internet, which can be a vector for unauthorized access. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Initial Access (T1078) and Credential Access (T1110).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Event Log:** Check the relevant Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4624 and record the context of the logon attempts, including the user's account and source IP address.
  - **Correlate with Historical Data:** Use EDR tools to correlate the public IP addresses with known malicious sources or risk intelligence feeds to assess the credibility of the connection.
  - **Examine Remote Session Activity:** Utilize EDR or network monitoring tools to analyze the behavior of the session initiated through RDP, looking for any abnormal activities or unauthorized command execution.
  - **Check Firewall and RDP Configuration:** Review the firewall logs on the network gateway and analyze RDP settings to ensure that only intended public access is allowed and that there are no unauthorized opens in the firewall settings.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is set to medium because successful logins from public IP addresses can indicate potential unauthorized access. However, the context of the source IP and the legitimacy of the user account must also be taken into consideration to accurately assess the threat level.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where logs are missing or improperly configured, such as if the Windows Security Log does not capture the Event ID 4624. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may utilize VPNs or proxy servers, which will obfuscate their real public IP address, leading to potential missed detections. The rule's efficacy depends on proper logging configurations and the monitoring of any legitimate traffic that may originate from public IPs.

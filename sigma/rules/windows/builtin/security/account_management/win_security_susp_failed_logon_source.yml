description: Detects a failed logon attempt from a public IP. A login from a public
  IP can indicate a misconfigured firewall or network boundary.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Failed Logon From Public IP" rule detects instances of failed logon attempts originating from public IP addresses, which might indicate potential unauthorized access attempts or misconfigurations in firewall settings. It specifically looks for Windows Security Event Log entries where EventID 4625 is recorded, indicating a failed logon. To filter out legitimate internal traffic, the rule employs conditions to exclude known private IP address ranges, such as local loopback and various internal address groups, from the detection. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Initial Access (T1078) and Persistence (T1190), focusing on unauthorized logins that could be an entry point for an attacker.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Failed Logon Attempts:** Review EventID 4625 logs in the Windows Security log for the specific timestamp of the alert to gather details about the account and the originating IP address.
  - **Check Public IP Lookup:** Utilize an IP lookup service to confirm the public nature of the IP address associated with the failed logon attempt, which helps in determining if the source is indeed suspicious.
  - **Review Firewall Configurations:** Assess the network firewall and access control list configurations to ensure proper permissions are set for logins from public IPs, mitigating potential exposures.
  - **Monitor for Follow-Up Activity:** After addressing the alert, monitor for any subsequent successful login attempts or anomalous activity on the affected accounts, enabling detection of potential further intrusion.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because while failed logon attempts can signify basic reconnaissance efforts by potential attackers, they may also stem from legitimate users or misconfigurations, warranting timely investigation but not an immediate escalation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  A notable blind spot for this rule is the potential for legitimate users to attempt logins from public networks inadvertently; this may lead to false positives. Additionally, if attackers employ techniques to obfuscate their IP addresses or exploit IPv4-to-IPv6 mappings, the rule may fail to trigger. Engineers should acknowledge that misconfigured firewall settings or VPN use may also contribute to legitimate users being flagged by this detection.

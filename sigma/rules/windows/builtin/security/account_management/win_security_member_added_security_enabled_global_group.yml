  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect when a member is added to a security-enabled global group within a Windows environment. The focus is primarily on monitoring two specific Windows Event IDs: 4728, which indicates that a member has been added to a security-enabled global group, and 632, which corroborates the same action. Such changes in group membership can have significant implications for access control and permissions within the organization, potentially being leveraged by attackers to escalate privileges or exfiltrate data. 
  The rule primarily uses data from Windows Security logs, which capture relevant actions performed by users or systems in a Windows environment. These logs include detailed information about security-related events, enabling analysts to trace changes in group memberships. It ties into the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of Persistence (T1098), as adversaries may manipulate group memberships to maintain access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Event Context:** Investigate the events with IDs 4728 and 632 in the Windows Security logs. Focus on the timestamp, user, and the specific global group affected to understand the scope of the change.
  - **Check for Unauthorized Changes:** Use EDR alerts to identify if there are any correlating suspicious activities occurring before or after the group membership change, such as unusual login attempts or file modifications by the user involved.
  - **Review Group Policies and Permissions:** Examine group policies associated with the security-enabled global group to assess the privileges and potential impact of the new member. This can clarify if the addition poses a risk to sensitive resources.
  - **Audit Membership History:** Utilize logs to review previous modifications to group memberships for patterns or changes that may indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation events.
  ### Prioritization
  Although this alert is rated as low severity, it is essential not to overlook it, as changes in group memberships can lead to privilege escalation. Proper investigation is crucial, especially if the change appears unauthorized or suspicious.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the changes to group membership occur during bulk modifications or administrative tasks that are legitimate in nature. Additionally, if users or processes circumvent logging mechanisms or use direct Active Directory manipulation through scripts, the events may not be recorded, thus leading to missed detections. Analysts should be aware that automated scripts can generate false positives if not validated against organizational change control policies.

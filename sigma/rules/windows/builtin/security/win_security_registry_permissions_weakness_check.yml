title: Service Registry Key Read Access Request
id: 11d00fff-5dc3-428c-8184-801f292faec0
status: test
description: |
  Detects "read access" requests on the services registry key.
  Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services.
  Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Service Registry Key Read Access Request" rule is designed to detect unauthorized read access requests to critical Windows registry keys related to services. Adversaries may exploit weak permissions on these registry keys to gain control over service executions, allowing them to redirect legitimate service calls to malicious payloads they control. This rule focuses on monitoring Security Event logs, specifically looking for Event ID 4663, which indicates a read access attempt on registry objects, particularly those located in the `SYSTEM\ControlSet\Services\` directory. The rule checks whether the access request includes the specific `READ_CONTROL` permission, which can signal an adversary's attempt to manipulate service behavior. This detection aligns with several MITRE ATT&CK techniques, including T1574.011 (Service Registry Permissions Weakness).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Investigate the Security Event logs for Event ID 4663 occurrences, focusing on the time of the alert for any associated accounts or processes that might indicate malicious activity.
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Use EDR tools to review the process tree associated with the read access request to identify any potentially suspicious processes or unusual parent-child relationships.
  - **Review Registry Permissions:** Inspect the permissions set on the registry keys involved to ensure they are correctly configured and not overly permissive, potentially highlighting misconfigurations that could be exploited.
  - **Correlate with Other Data Sources:** Utilize logs from Threat Intelligence platforms, AV, or NDR tools to correlate alerts with known malicious behavior or adversary tactics, possibly revealing broader attack patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is set to a low severity level primarily because legitimate applications frequently read their service registry keys. However, the investigation is still warranted to rule out potential misuse or exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule relies on Security Descriptor DACLs being properly configured and SACLs enabled for the relevant registry keys. It assumes that administrative privileges have not been misused to alter permissions. The rule may fail to fire in environments where auditing policies are not enforced, or if an attacker uses more stealthy techniques to avoid triggering registry access events.

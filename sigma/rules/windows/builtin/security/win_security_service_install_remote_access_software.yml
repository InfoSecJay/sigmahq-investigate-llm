  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the installation of known remote access tools (RATs) on Windows systems. The rule specifically looks for Event ID 4697 in the Windows Security logs, which indicates the creation of a new service. The services targeted by this rule, such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk, and LogMeIn, are frequently abused by threat actors for unauthorized remote access and persistence, making their installation a potential indicator of compromise. This is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of *Persistence* (TA0003) and technique 1543.003, focusing on the installation of services as a method for maintaining access to systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Service Status**: Use PowerShell or EDR tools to verify the status of the identified services. Look for any unusual service states that may indicate tampering or malicious activity.
  - **Review Service Creation Logs**: Investigate Windows Event Logs, specifically filtering around the time the service was created to identify any associated events or processes that led to the installation.
  - **Correlate with Network Activities**: Review network logs for unusual connections or traffic associated with the identified remote access tools, especially to external IP addresses or domains that are not typically used within the organization's environment.
  - **Inspect User Accounts**: Utilize the Security logs to identify the user account under which the service was created, checking for any anomalous access patterns or unauthorized user accounts that may have installed the service.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert should be treated with medium severity as the presence of remote access tools can indicate an adversary's foothold in the environment, but may also be a legitimate administrative action depending on your organization's policies regarding these tools.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where the logging of Event ID 4697 is not enabled, or where legitimate administrative use of remote access tools is prevalent, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, skilled adversaries might use custom service names or other tactics to obfuscate their activities, evading detection. It is assumed that all monitored systems are configured to log security events correctly for this detection to be effective.

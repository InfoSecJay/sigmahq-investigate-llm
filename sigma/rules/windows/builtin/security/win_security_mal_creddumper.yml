  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the execution of well-known credential dumping tools through Windows service execution. Specifically, it focuses on identifying the creation of new services (EventID 4697) that include certain keywords associated with credential dumping tools in their file names, such as “cachedump,” “pwdump,” and “mimidrv.” By monitoring the Windows Security logs, the SOC can identify potentially malicious activities aiming to extract sensitive credential information from the system. This detection mechanism aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for Credential Access (T1003), which highlights the techniques adversaries may employ to recover user credentials and other sensitive data.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs:** Examine the Windows Security event logs for EventID 4697 correlating with the detected execution. Identify the originating user account and any associated processes to understand the context of the alert.
    
  - **Check Service Configuration:** Investigate the newly created service's configuration to determine if it aligns with known legitimate use cases or if it exhibits suspicious behavior, such as unusual command-line parameters or uncommon service names.
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze any network connections made by the service for potential data exfiltration attempts. Look for unusual external connections or anomalous behavior originating from the host.
  - **Assess User Privileges:** Determine if the account responsible for the service execution holds excessive privileges that could facilitate credential dumping. Check group memberships and permissions to identify potential misuse.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of credential dumping potential in an enterprise environment. Successful execution of such tools could compromise sensitive information, leading to escalated privileges and further compromise of the network.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the credential dumping tools use non-standard names that are not included in the search criteria. Additionally, it assumes that relevant logging for EventID 4697 is appropriately configured and enabled; if such logging is disabled, legitimate service creation events may go undetected. Adversaries may also employ obfuscation techniques to disguise their activities, potentially evading detection by this rule.

  ### Technical Context
  The **HybridConnectionManager Service Installation** rule is designed to identify suspicious installations of the Hybrid Connection Manager service, which is often seen as a persistence mechanism in Windows environments. Specifically, this rule monitors Windows Security Event ID 4697, which indicates the creation of a new service. The detection logic focuses on the service name "HybridConnectionManager" and checks that the service's executable file name contains the term "HybridConnectionManager." Anomalies relating to this service can indicate attempts by adversaries to maintain footholds within the network by utilizing legitimate services for unauthorized purposes. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Persistence** and the specific technique of **T1554: Staged Execution**, highlighting the need for vigilance in service management practices.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Service Installation**: Using the Windows Security logs, confirm the details of Event ID 4697, including the service account and execution path to determine if the installation is legitimate or potentially malicious.
  - **Cross-reference Windows Event Logs**: Investigate correlated events around the same time as the service installation, including event 7045 (New Service Installed) and critical security logs to gain context on the user actions leading to the installation.
  - **Check for Malicious Activity**: Utilize EDR tools to scan the endpoint where the service was installed for any discrepancies or signs of compromise, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual file behaviors.
  - **Network Activity Analysis**: Review proxy and network logs to observe any unusual outbound activity from the newly created service, which could indicate exploitation or data exfiltration efforts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is set to high severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized service installations that could enable attackers to maintain persistent access to the environment, thus compromising network integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One key assumption of this rule is that the logging for the 'System Security Extension' audit subcategory is consistently enabled across all systems within the enterprise. The rule may not trigger in environments where logging is insufficient or misconfigured, particularly if the service is installed under conditions that do not generate Event ID 4697. Additionally, the usage of legitimate services, such as Hybrid Connection Manager, in Azure function applications can lead to false positives, which might desensitize alert responses if not properly contextualized.

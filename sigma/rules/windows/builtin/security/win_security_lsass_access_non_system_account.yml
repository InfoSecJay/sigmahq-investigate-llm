  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to monitor unauthorized access attempts to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) from non-system accounts, which can be indicative of credential stealing tools, such as Mimikatz. The rule specifically looks for Windows Security Event IDs 4663 (An attempt was made to access an object) and 4656 (A handle to an object was requested) with specific Access Masks that denote read access to the LSASS process. The monitoring leverages Windows Security logs, which capture critical access events, enabling the detection of potentially malicious attempts to exfiltrate sensitive credential data. The rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Credential Access** and the technique **T1003.001: Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review Security Event Logs for Event IDs 4663 and 4656 around the time of the alert to identify the specific non-system account attempting access to LSASS.
  - **Analyze Process Context:** Investigate the associated processes that triggered the alert. Look for unusual parent-child relationships or any suspicious process executables that may indicate a potential credential theft tool.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Use EDR tools to trace the activity of the process that accessed LSASS. Examine process timelines, command line arguments, and any connections made by the process during this time to identify any malicious behavior.
  - **Review User Activity:** Verify the actions performed by the user account that attempted access to LSASS. Check for abnormal user activity or if the account has a history of prior suspicious behavior in your environment.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the high sensitivity of the LSASS process, which contains stored credentials. Unauthorized access attempts from non-system accounts can indicate potentially serious threats or compromise scenarios that warrant immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in scenarios where authorized system accounts access LSASS or when attackers utilize legitimate administrative accounts, minimizing detection frequency. Additionally, the rule assumes logs are properly configured and available, and it may miss access attempts through legitimate processes or services that could otherwise obscure malicious activities. False positives may arise from legitimate software operating within expected parameters.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "WCE wceaux.dll Access" is designed to detect attempts to access the `wceaux.dll` library, which is commonly associated with Windows Credential Editor (WCE) activities, particularly in the context of pass-the-hash attacks. When an attacker uses WCE to perform remote command execution leveraging stolen hashed credentials, illicit access to `wceaux.dll` may occur. This rule specifically monitors Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4656 (Handle Request) and Event ID 4663 (Object Access), filtering for events where the Object Name ends with `\wceaux.dll`. The MITRE ATT&CK framework associates this detection with the tactic of Credential Access and the technique T1003 (Credential Dumping), making it critical for identifying unauthorized credential manipulation activities within an enterprise network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Event Logs**: Check Windows Security Event Logs for recent Event IDs 4656 and 4663 to find detailed context of the access attempts to `wceaux.dll`.
  - **Analyze Source Host Activity**: Use EDR tools to collect and review process creation and network activity logs from the source host to understand what commands or scripts the user executed prior to the DLL access.
  - **Correlate with User Accounts**: Investigate the user account associated with the alert, determining if it is a legitimate access attempt or potential abuse via compromised credentials, and identify any unusual behavior.
  - **Check for Related Lateral Movement**: Utilize network logs and proxy data to trace any lateral movement originating from the source host, looking for suspicious connections to other systems that could indicate further exploitation attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as critical due to the potential implications of credential theft and unauthorized access that can compromise sensitive systems and data, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several potential blind spots associated with this rule. For instance, if `wceaux.dll` is accessed legitimately by trusted applications or processes, false positives may occur. Additionally, if an adversary uses a different method or tool to achieve similar objectives without accessing `wceaux.dll`, this detection will not trigger. The effectiveness of this rule is also contingent upon proper logging configurations and the absence of log manipulation by an attacker.

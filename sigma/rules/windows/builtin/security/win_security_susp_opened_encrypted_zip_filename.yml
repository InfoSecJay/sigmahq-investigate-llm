  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the opening of password-protected ZIP files with suspicious filenames on Windows systems. The rule specifically looks for Windows Security Event ID 5379, which indicates an action taken by a user to open a compressed (ZIP) file using the Microsoft Windows Shell. The detection focuses on filenames that may indicate potentially malicious intent (e.g., "invoice," "new order," "rechnung," etc.), often associated with phishing or other social engineering attacks targeting sensitive data.
  The rule connects to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Command and Control (T1071) and Defense Evasion (T1027) as the use of these types of files may be a method for adversaries to communicate or deliver malicious payloads while attempting to evade detection. Analysts should be aware that the presence of these events may not automatically indicate malicious activity; rather, they are indicators that warrant further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Use the Security logs in Windows Event Viewer to locate Event ID 5379 entries and correlate with the timestamps of the alert to understand user activity. Focus on the associated user account to identify any unusual access patterns.
    
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize EDR and NDR solutions to examine outgoing network connections related to the user or the process that opened the ZIP file. Check for suspicious or unknown destinations that could indicate command-and-control activity.
    
  - **Examine File Source:** Investigate the origin of the password-protected ZIP file through Proxy logs, especially if it was downloaded from an external source. Validate whether it aligns with legitimate business operations or if it was sourced from a potentially harmful location.
  - **Perform Endpoint Assessment:** Utilize EDR tools to scan the endpoint for other signs of compromise, such as associated processes, unusual file modifications, or alerts triggered by antivirus solutions. Focus on any subsequent file extractions or executions linked to the ZIP file in question.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity in the enterprise environment due to the potential implications of opening password-protected ZIP files, which could be tied to data exfiltration or the execution of malicious payloads. Immediate investigation is recommended to mitigate potential risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several blind spots and assumptions with this Sigma rule. First, legitimate uses of encrypted ZIP files may not necessarily be malicious, which may lead to false positives. Additionally, if the ZIP files are opened in a way that does not trigger Event ID 5379 (e.g., using third-party software), the rule would not fire. Adversaries might also utilize less common filenames or employ file types that do not get detected by this rule. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of suspicious filename patterns may be needed to keep this detection relevant.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the creation of local user accounts on Windows servers, specifically focusing on Event ID 4720 from Windows Security logs. In an Active Directory (AD) environment, the creation of local user accounts is abnormal and often indicative of unauthorized activity, as user account management should typically be centralized within AD. The rule captures instances where a new user account is formed locally rather than through the proper domain-controlled mechanisms. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Persistence tactic, specifically the technique T1136.001, which pertains to the creation of local accounts as a means of maintaining access and control over target systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Event Logs**: Use the Windows Security logs to locate Event ID 4720 entries, which will provide details on the user creation, including the account name and the process that initiated the event.
  - **Correlate with User Account Management**: Verify whether the user creation aligns with legitimate administrative activities by cross-referencing with your organization's change management records or privileged user access logs.
  - **Evaluate Network Activity**: Analyze the EDR and network logs to check for unexpected or suspicious activities from the associated IP address or hostname during the timeframe of the alert.
  - **Scan for Other Indicators**: Check for additional events and logs, such as failed logon attempts or unusual account access, that may indicate potential adversary activity related to the newly created account.
  ### Prioritization
  Although this alert is rated as low severity, it should not be dismissed outright, especially in environments where local user creation violates policy. Prompt investigation is essential to ensure that local accounts are not being used for malicious access or system compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where local user creation is legitimately conducted using privileged account management tools or specific service configurations designed to allow local account management. Additionally, the rule assumes that Windows Security logs are being properly captured and monitored on the targeted servers, and it may fail to trigger if logging is disabled or misconfigured. Adversaries may also employ techniques to create accounts without generating the expected events, such as using exploits or API calls that do not invoke standard logging.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activity related to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections that utilize a reverse SSH tunnel, focusing specifically on instances where the RDP service (`termsvcs`) is communicated from or to the loopback address (127.0.0.1 or ::1). The underlying mechanism works by monitoring Windows Security Event logs, specifically targeting Event ID 5156, which logs instances of permitted connection attempts through Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). The rule sets criteria to detect if an application named "thor" (which may be associated with testing vulnerabilities such as BlueKeep) is involved in a loopback connection attempt on port 3389, allowing for a potential command-and-control channel to be established. This behavior correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques: **T1090.001** (Application Layer Protocol: Protocol Tunneling) and **T1021.001** (Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol) under the **Defense Evasion** and **Command-and-Control** tactics.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 5156 to confirm the occurrence of RDP connections involving the loopback address. Look for unauthorized applications or unusual timestamps that correlate with the alerts.
    
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize the EDR's network monitoring capabilities to track outbound connections from the affected host. Pay special attention to connections to external IP addresses on port 3389.
  - **Examine Running Processes:** Investigate the running processes on the affected host for the presence of 'thor.exe' or 'thor64.exe'. These processes could indicate exploit attempts or backdoor installations.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Check for any related alerts within the SIEM that could indicate lateral movement or command-and-control activities from the detected host. Use tagging and logs from proxy and VPN for additional context.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of RDP connections over a reverse SSH tunnel, this alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network, posing significant risks to information security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes a properly configured environment where normal, authorized RDP usage does not involve local loopback connections. It may not fire if legitimate services or applications connect legitimately to the RDP port using localhost. Furthermore, if an adversary uses legitimate applications to tunnel RDP traffic, or if they disable the logging of events related to WFP, the rule could fail to trigger. Therefore, it is essential for engineers to consider various legitimate scenarios that could produce false positives or lead to an evasion of detection.

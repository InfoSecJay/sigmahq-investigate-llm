  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the establishment of inbound network connections to ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS), which are used for Windows Remote Management (WinRM). WinRM is a component of Windows that enables the remote execution of PowerShell commands, and its misuse can indicate potential unauthorized access or exploitation attempts within an enterprise network. The rule leverages Windows Security logs, specifically focusing on EventID 5156, which logs successful connection attempts through the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). By monitoring connections to these specific ports, the rule helps identify potential threats leveraging PowerShell Remoting, a technique associated with MITRE ATT&CK's Execution tactic, specifically the technique T1059.001 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Network Traffic:** Utilize the Network Detection and Response (NDR) tool to analyze the data surrounding the identified inbound connections, including source IP addresses, associated processes, and timestamps.
    
  - **Review Security Logs:** Inspect Windows Security logs for EventID 5156 entries related to the detected network connections. Pay attention to the accounts used and the source of the connection attempts.
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Leverage Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to identify any processes that initiated the WinRM connections, including checking for unusual or unauthorized PowerShell execution that might correspond with the network activity.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Evaluate user activity logs to ensure that the connections align with legitimate business actions. This may involve checking whether the user is authorized to use WinRM and confirming that their actions are consistent with normal behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level of this alert is justified due to the potential risk of unauthorized remote access to systems through WinRM, which can lead to significant security incidents if exploited by an attacker.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection may not trigger under certain circumstances, such as when the legitimate use of WinRM occurs within an organization, thus leading to false positives. Additionally, an adversary may employ alternative methods to bypass WinRM monitoring, like using different ports or methods to execute commands. The enterprise should also consider the potential obscured connections, such as tunneling WinRM traffic through encrypted channels or using non-standard ports.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect any modifications to Active Directory objects that involve the addition of Security Identifier (SID) history. SID history is a feature that allows an account from one domain to retain access to resources in another domain, potentially leading to privilege escalation if used maliciously. The rule identifies relevant Windows Security event logs, particularly Event IDs 4765 (A SID History was added) and 4766 (A SID History has been modified), as well as Event ID 4738, which indicates that an account's properties have been changed. The detection condition checks for the presence of modifications to the SID history attribute while ensuring that valid migration activities (where SID history is set to null or contains specific values) do not trigger false positives.
  This detection is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of *Persistence* and technique *T1134.005: Access Token Manipulation* where attackers may leverage SID history to gain elevated privileges on a network, raising serious security concerns for organizations that rely on Active Directory for user management and security.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Event Logs:** Review Windows Security event logs for Event IDs 4765 and 4766 associated with the alerted account. Identify any recent changes made to SID history and correlate them with the time of the alert.
  - **Validate User Account Activity:** Utilize the EDR to examine the account's activities preceding and following the SID history alteration. Look for unusual login patterns, privilege access attempts, or resource access that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Cross-reference with Other Logs:** Search through DNS and network connection logs for any related suspicious activities that may have occurred around the same time as the SID history changes. This will help identify lateral movement or command-and-control activities.
  - **Engage in Account Context Analysis:** Investigate whether the account was part of any recent migrations or legitimate administrative actions. Consult Active Directory logs to verify the authenticity of the SID history change, noting potential impersonation actions.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is rated as medium due to the potential for privilege escalation that may arise from unauthorized changes to SID history. However, legitimate administrative tasks, such as migrations, could lead to false alarms, necessitating careful investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are a few key assumptions and blind spots associated with this detection rule. Firstly, if the SID history is altered during a sanctioned migration or in conjunction with other legitimate actions, the rule may not accurately reflect malicious intent. Additionally, security measures such as proper logging and monitoring of Active Directory changes are essential, as misconfigured settings could lead to the rule being bypassed. Furthermore, attackers may use other techniques or methods to manipulate SID history without triggering normal logging protocols, which could hinder detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "SAM Registry Hive Handle Request" is designed to detect unauthorized or suspicious access requests made to the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) registry hive on Windows systems. The SAM registry hive is critical for storing user account information and security descriptors, making it a prime target for attackers seeking to elevate privileges or gain access to sensitive credentials. This rule works by monitoring Windows Security Event Logs, specifically looking for Event ID 4656, which indicates that a handle was requested for an objectâ€”in this case, a registry key that ends with '\SAM'. When an event matches these criteria, it suggests that an actor may be attempting to access or manipulate privileged user account data, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Discovery (T1012) and Credential Access (T1552.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Details:** Review the corresponding Event ID 4656 logs to identify the SubjectUserName, SubjectDomainName, ProcessName, and ObjectName associated with the access request to the SAM registry hive.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate process activity around the same time frame to identify any suspicious processes that may correlate with the registry access request.
  - **Examine User Context:** Investigate the user context under which the access was requested. Determine if the user has legitimate reasons for accessing the SAM hive or if they may be an unauthorized entity.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Use NDR solutions to examine any network activity correlating with the time of the detected access to identify if additional external or lateral movement was attempted.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is labeled as high severity due to the sensitive nature of the SAM registry hive; unauthorized access to this area may indicate malicious attempts to gain user credentials or escalate privileges within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule is effective in detecting potential unauthorized access requests, it assumes that all relevant logs are being captured and that no obfuscation or manipulation of logging is performed by the adversary. Additionally, it may not fire if legitimate administrative users are performing routine tasks, or if security logging is disabled or misconfigured on targeted systems. Furthermore, sophisticated attack techniques that bypass or manipulate native logging, such as direct memory manipulation or kernel-level exploits, may evade detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "VSSAudit Security Event Source Registration" is designed to detect the registration of the "VSSAudit" security event source, which typically occurs during volume shadow copy operations. This activity can be indicative of legitimate backup operations or potentially malicious actions aimed at evading detection by manipulating shadow copies. The rule monitors Windows Security Event Logs, specifically filtering for Event IDs 4904 and 4905 associated with the "VSSAudit" source. The events tracked reflect actions related to Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), making them relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Credential Access and the technique T1003.002, which deals with credential dumping via Volume Shadow Copies. 
  By focusing on these specific events, SOC analysts can ascertain whether volume shadow copies are being utilized as part of regular operations or if they signal nefarious attempts by an adversary to access and copy sensitive data without detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Windows Security Logs:** Review Windows Security Event Logs for Event IDs 4904 and 4905 to determine the context of the VSSAudit event registrations and identify any associated user accounts or applications involved.
    
  - **Validate Source Processes:** Cross-reference the logged events with process creation logs (Sysmon or other EDR) to confirm that the legitimate process `C:\Windows\System32\VSSVC.exe` is being used, thereby reducing false positive alerts tied to backup operations.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Utilize network detection tools (NDR, Proxy) to monitor for unusual outbound connections or data transfer activities that coincide with VSSAudit events, as these could indicate data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Review Backup Procedures:** Investigate standard backup operations and their scheduling to determine if the VSSAudit events align with legitimate IT activities, reducing the likelihood of unnecessary incident escalations.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as informational due to its association with legitimate backup activities; however, any unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempting to utilize VSS should be prioritized for further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate VSS operations are misconfigured or if event logging is turned off for the necessary IDs, which may lead to missed detection. Additionally, adversaries can potentially disable or manipulate VSS to avoid detection, creating a reliance on proper logging configurations and file integrity monitoring to ensure the rule is effective. Understanding environmental baselines is crucial for recognizing malicious activity effectively.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect instances in Active Directory where a user is assigned the "SeEnableDelegationPrivilege." This privilege can grant a user control over other user objects, potentially leading to unauthorized access and misuse of account privileges. The detection is based on monitoring Windows Security logs, specifically Event ID 4704, which tracks changes in user rights assignments. By filtering for entries that include "SeEnableDelegationPrivilege" within the privilege list, the rule can identify potentially dangerous configurations that could jeopardize the integrity of the Active Directory environment. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence and the technique T1098, which deals with account manipulation and privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs:** Check Windows Security logs for Event ID 4704 to identify which user was granted the "SeEnableDelegationPrivilege" and analyze the time and context of the change.
  - **Audit User Actions:** Utilize EDR tools to monitor behaviors of the affected user account for any unusual or unauthorized activities following the privilege escalation.
  - **Cross-Reference AD Configuration:** Examine the Active Directory configuration to ensure that granting this privilege aligns with organizational policies and assess its necessity.
  - **Query User Access Levels:** Use PowerShell scripts or Active Directory management tools to list all users with delegated rights, focusing on those with the "SeEnableDelegationPrivilege" to assess potential risks.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the significant risk posed by users having elevated privileges in Active Directory, which can lead to unauthorized access and broader exploitation within the corporate environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the auditing for authorization policy changes is not enabled or configured correctly. Additionally, skilled adversaries might create new user accounts with similar privileges or change existing ones in ways that do not generate Event ID 4704, circumventing detection. It's essential to ensure that all necessary auditing policies are in place and that there is an ongoing review of privilege assignments.

  ### Technical Context
  The “First Time Seen Remote Named Pipe” detection rule identifies newly observed remote named pipes that are accessible, potentially indicating malicious lateral movement and remote execution attempts. Named pipes are a form of inter-process communication that can be exploited for remote execution by attackers. This rule monitors Windows Security Event logs, specifically EventID 5145, which indicates access to shared resources such as named pipes. By filtering out known benign named pipes (such as those listed in the `false_positives` section), the rule aims to minimize false alerts while still capturing potentially malicious activity. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Lateral Movement (T1021.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Alert Details:** Examine the event details for the triggered alert in the SIEM to gather context about the pipe access attempt, including the system, user account, and time of the event.
  - **Analyze Endpoint Behavior:** Use EDR tools to assess the processes that initiated the named pipe access, looking for any unusual or unauthorized activities that might suggest lateral movement.
  - **Investigate Network Traffic:** Query network logs to observe any connections made to remote systems that coincide with the alert timeframe, particularly looking for patterns indicative of lateral movement.
  - **Inspect User Accounts:** Review the accounts involved in the alert to determine if any are suspicious or have anomalous behavior that could indicate compromise or misuse.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the risk it poses for lateral movement within the network, which can lead to further compromise if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection could fail to trigger if named pipe access isn't logged due to misconfigured auditing or if known legitimate named pipes are not updated in the `false_positives` list, leading to potential bypasses by adversaries. Additionally, if an attacker uses direct socket communication rather than named pipes, this rule would not fire, making it crucial for analysts to consider multiple avenues of attack during investigations.

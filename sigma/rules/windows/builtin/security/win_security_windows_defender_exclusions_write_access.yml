  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for write access requests to the Windows Defender exclusions registry keys, specifically looking for Event IDs 4656 and 4663. These events are generated when a handle is requested to an object or an attempt is made to access an object, respectively. The rule focuses on registry access to the path `\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions\`, checking for specific access rights such as WriteData or AppendData. This type of activity is closely associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001), as attackers may attempt to manipulate Windows Defender settings to create exclusions that allow malicious software to operate undetected.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review Security Event Logs for Event ID 4656 and 4663 related to write access on the Windows Defender exclusions registry keys to understand the context of the access request.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Investigate the user account that initiated the access request by correlating the event with recent user activity to determine if the actions appear suspicious or out of the ordinary.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Use EDR tools to trace processes associated with the user's actions, specifically looking for any potentially malicious activity or processes that may have attempted to modify the registry settings.
  - **Consult with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference the alert with threat intelligence feeds that might highlight known malware or persistent threats that utilize similar registry manipulation techniques.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for attackers to bypass security mechanisms by modifying registry keys, which could lead to an increased attack surface within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if auditing of the relevant registry actions is not configured properly or if the necessary auditing policies are disabled. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks could potentially trigger false positives, complicating investigations. Adversaries may also utilize legitimate tools or processes under the guise of normal operations, making detection more challenging when proper logging and alerting are not in place.

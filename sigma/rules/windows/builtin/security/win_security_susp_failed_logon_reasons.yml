  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify suspicious account tampering through the analysis of failed logon attempts, specifically looking at uncommon error codes associated with these failures. The error codes targeted indicate scenarios where users attempt to log in with accounts that have been disabled, are outside of authorized access hours, or are trying to authenticate from unauthorized workstations. By monitoring Windows Security event logs, particularly Event ID 4625 and 4776, the rule focuses on these rare failure reasons that may suggest malicious attempts to breach an account or escalate privileges in the environment. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics include **Persistence** (initial access or maintaining access using compromised accounts) and **Defense Evasion**, through techniques such as account manipulation and unauthorized access attempts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Failed Logon Events:** Examine the Windows Security event logs for Event ID 4625 and 4776 that match the specified error codes to understand the context and frequency of failed logon attempts.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check for any previous logon attempts by the same user account to establish if there has been a pattern of suspicious behavior. This can be done using EDR logs or correlating events in your SIEM.
  - **Check User Account Status:** Verify the status of the user accounts involved in the alerts by looking in Active Directory or relevant management consoles for attributes such as account lockout, expiration, or disabled state.
  - **Analyze Network Access:** Determine if there are any corresponding logs from network appliances (e.g., VPN or NGFW) that show unauthorized access attempts from the specified workstations or external IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity because it suggests potential account tampering or misuse, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation, posing a medium-level risk to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that logging for failed logon attempts is enabled and that the specified error codes are generated regularly in the environment. False positives may arise if legitimate users legitimately attempt to log in with degraded accounts. Additionally, if attacks leverage methods to obscure their actions, such as using valid credentials or exploiting authorized users outside typical hours, the rule may fail to fire on those incidents, highlighting a need for comprehensive security monitoring across user behavior in conjunction with this rule.

  ### Technical Context
  The “Suspicious Remote Logon with Explicit Credentials” rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activity where processes are logging onto systems using explicit credentials. Specifically, it looks for Event ID 4648 in Windows Security logs, indicating that a logon attempt was made with a specified username and password, which is commonly used in lateral movement attempts by attackers. The rule focuses on process names typically associated with command line interfaces and scripting products, such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wmic.exe`, as well as interactions with network-related commands like `net.exe`. This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Lateral Movement" and technique "T1078: Valid Accounts," which involves legitimate account credentials being exploited for unauthorized access to additional systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the relevant Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4648 entries linked to the alerted processes to confirm whether explicit credentials were indeed used for remote logon.
  - **Analyze Process Context:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate the specified processes (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`), examining command-line arguments and parent-child process relationships for any suspicious behavior or anomalies.
  - **Review Account Activity:** Query logs for the TargetUserName and SubjectUserName mentioned in the alert to monitor their activity and any associated VPN or remote access logs to establish the context of the login attempt.
  - **Investigate Historical Changes:** Search through application or system logs for any deployment or configuration changes around the time of the alert, particularly focusing on scheduled tasks or administrative actions that could justify the use of explicit logons.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be considered medium severity in an enterprise environment because it indicates the potential misuse of valid accounts, which could lead to unauthorized access but may also be legitimate administrative activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is essential to recognize that this rule may not fire in legitimate scenarios involving the use of administrative accounts executing the RunAs command, or when scheduled tasks backed by service accounts are in use. Additionally, if the use of explicit credentials is masked by obfuscation techniques employed by adversaries, such as using a less common executable or scripting language, the detection may fail. Analysts should remain vigilant for signs of abuse of administrative privileges, especially in environments with multiple legitimate administrative users.

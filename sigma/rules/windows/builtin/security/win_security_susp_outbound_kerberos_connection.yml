  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies unusual outbound network activity that utilizes the Kerberos protocol on the default port (88), which could indicate lateral movement or initial privilege escalation attempts via delegation. The rule specifically monitors Windows Security logs for Event ID 5156, which records allowed outbound network connections. It filters out common legitimate applications such as `lsass.exe`, web browsers, and application servers, conditioning the detection to trigger when activity does not originate from these known applications. 
  The inclusion of these filters is important because adversaries often exploit legitimate Kerberos authentication processes to carry out lateral movement without raising immediate suspicion. When an unusual Kerberos connection is established from less typical applications, it warrants further investigation. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Lateral Movement** and the technique **T1558.003** (Credential Dumping by Kerberos Ticket).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Examine endpoint detection and response alerts for any related suspicious processes or behaviors that coincide with the detected Kerberos activity.
  - **Check Network Connections**: Utilize network monitoring tools to analyze the outbound connections from the affected endpoint, focusing on traffic to the Kerberos service and associated timestamps of the alert.
  - **Analyze Security Logs**: Investigate Windows Security logs for additional Event ID 5156 entries before and after the alert time to establish a broader context of network activity.
  - **Correlate User Activity**: Cross-reference user logon events and application access from Windows logs to determine if the activity corresponds with user actions or suspicious access patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level for this alert indicates a noteworthy risk in an enterprise environment, suggesting that the activity may be part of an attempted lateral movement or privilege escalation strategy, which requires timely investigation to mitigate potential threats.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the use of the Kerberos protocol is legitimate within the organizationâ€™s operations, particularly if baseline metrics for normal behavior have not been established. Additionally, it assumes that internal applications or services may not be involved in unauthorized activities. Adversaries could also potentially defeat this detection by mimicking legitimate Kerberos transactions through approved applications, thereby blending their malicious activity with legitimate network traffic.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious modifications in Active Directory permissions, specifically through the unauthorized use of the PowerView PowerShell module. The focus is on capturing events where a regular user or machine account is granted rights associated with DCSync, enabling the potential extraction of password hashes from the Active Directory. The rule identifies these modifications by monitoring Windows Security event logs for specific Event IDs (5136) that signify changes to the security descriptor of directory objects. The rule particularly looks for attributes within the LDAP display name that indicate the manipulation of access control lists for DCSync privileges, which could be abused by adversaries to escalate privileges and maintain persistence within the network. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence (T1098), emphasizing the importance of monitoring Active Directory configurations for unauthorized changes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Logs:** Review Security event logs for Event ID 5136 focusing on the `ntSecurityDescriptor` attribute to identify potentially unauthorized changes.
  - **Check Object Class:** Filter detected events by examining the object classes associated with the modifications to confirm whether they pertain to DNS objects, which could indicate targeted backdooring activity.
  - **Audit User SIDs:** Validate the SIDs of users involved in the changes. Investigate if these users are legitimate accounts or if they have been anomalously altered to gain DCSync capabilities.
  - **Investigate PowerShell Activity:** Use EDR tools to search for any PowerShell activity related to the PowerView module around the time of the detected change, looking for unusual executions that correspond with the alerts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to the critical nature of Active Directory modifications that may enable adversaries to maintain persistence in the environment. Unauthorized permissions associated with the DCSync capability can lead to severe security breaches, including credential theft.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized issue is that the rule requires the "Audit Directory Service Changes" policy to be properly configured; if it’s not, legitimate changes may go undetected. Furthermore, the detection may not trigger if attackers utilize other, less-detectable methods for privilege escalation not involving the modification of DCSync rights. It’s assumed that attackers will often attempt to blend in with legitimate administrative activities, making it essential for investigators to have contextual awareness when analyzing the relevant changes.

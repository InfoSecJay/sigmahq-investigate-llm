description: detects execution of psexec or paexec with renamed service name, this
  rule helps to filter out the noise if psexec is used for legit purposes or if attacker
  uses a different psexec client other than sysinternal one

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious PsExec Execution" Sigma rule is designed to detect the usage of PsExec or its alternatives when executed under suspicious conditions, particularly when a renamed service name is associated with the execution. PsExec is a legitimate tool commonly used for remote command execution but is also favored by adversaries for lateral movements within networks. This rule leverages Windows Security logs, specifically focusing on Event ID 5145, which tracks file access and network share interactions. By filtering for specific share names (e.g., '\\*\IPC$') and the presence of the substring "PSEXESVC"—indicating a potentially malicious variant of PsExec—the rule aims to differentiate between legitimate and unauthorized uses of the tool. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Lateral Movement, specifically technique T1021.002 (Remote Services: PsExec).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Monitor Event Logs:** Review instances of Event ID 5145 in Windows Security logs associated with the alert to confirm the occurrence of PsExec activity. Pay special attention to the command lines and context surrounding these events.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Activities:** Utilize your EDR tool to correlate the detected PsExec events with process creation and execution activities, looking for related processes and their command-line arguments to ascertain intent.
  - **Assess User Accounts and Permissions:** Investigate the user account executing the PsExec command to determine whether it has elevated privileges that could suggest unauthorized access or misuse.
  - **Verify Network Activity:** Use network logs from EDR or NGFW to analyze any subsequent connections or activity originating from the host where PsExec was executed, particularly looking for connections to unusual or sensitive targets.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this rule flags potentially unauthorized uses of PsExec, a high severity level is justified in an enterprise environment due to the tool's historical use by attackers for lateral movement and gaining network access, which can lead to further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - The rule may not fire if PsExec is executed without the specified parameters or is run through a different share or service name entirely, which could allow an adversary to evade detection.
  - False positives may arise if the environment has legitimate uses for PsExec that do not conform to the identified patterns. Having a detailed whitelist of approved usages or configurations is essential to minimize noise.
  - The effectiveness of this rule is contingent upon proper audit policies being configured on the endpoints to capture necessary event data, particularly the detailed file share access.

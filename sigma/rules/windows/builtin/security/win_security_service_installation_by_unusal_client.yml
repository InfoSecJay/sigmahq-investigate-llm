  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to identify the installation of a Windows service by an unusual client, specifically instances where the client process ID (PID) is 0 or where the parent process ID is also 0. In Windows operating systems, a PID of 0 is typically associated with the kernel, generally indicating that the process is not user-initiated, which can be a significant red flag. The detection leverages Windows Security event logs, specifically looking for Event ID 4697, which logs service installations. By monitoring these logs, security teams can detect potentially malicious behavior, especially if services are being installed by unexpected processes. This tactic falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Privilege Escalation" category (T1543), signaling that an attacker may be attempting to gain elevated permissions or hide their activities through anomalous service installations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Event Logs**: Check the logs for Event ID 4697 to identify what service was installed, the time of installation, and any related details on the initiating process.
  - **Analyze Parent Process**: Utilize EDR tools to trace the parent process of the PID 0 event to gather more context about how the service was initiated and to identify any suspicious activity leading up to it.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs**: Inspect additional relevant telemetry sources–including Sysmon logs and network traffic–to detect any supplementary indicators of compromise, such as unusual network connections or access patterns.
  - **Investigate Service Behavior**: Once a suspicious service is identified, examine its configuration and functionality through tools like PowerShell or Windows Services management to confirm if it is legitimate or if it poses a security threat.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level of this alert is justified as installations made by processes with PID 0 are not typical and may indicate an attempt to exploit system-level privileges. Prompt investigation is critical to assess potential vulnerabilities and prevent further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the system audit policy for the System Security Extension is not properly configured to log Event ID 4697. Additionally, attackers could utilize alternative methods for service installations that do not involve using process ID 0, thus evading detection. It is essential for detection engineers to be aware that sophisticated adversaries might find ways to suppress or modify logs to conceal their activities.

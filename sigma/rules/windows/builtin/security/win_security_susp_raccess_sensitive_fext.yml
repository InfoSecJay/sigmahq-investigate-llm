  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious access to sensitive file extensions on a Windows network share by monitoring Security Event Logs for Event ID 5145. The rule specifically focuses on file access events targeting extensions that are often associated with sensitive data, such as .bak, .dmp, .pst, and others. When an event meets the defined criteria—indicating that a file with one of these extensions has been accessed—an alert is generated. This serves as a potential indicator of malicious activity, particularly in the context of data exfiltration or unauthorized access to sensitive information. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1039, which relates to the collection of sensitive information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs**: Investigate the generated alert by examining the corresponding Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 5145) around the time of the alert to gather context about the access event.
  - **Analyze User Context**: Determine who accessed the file, including their user account, login patterns, and role within the organization to assess if the access is legitimate or suspicious.
  - **Check Network Share Access**: Use the EDR tools to examine which network share was accessed and verify if it’s expected behavior for the user involved, especially focusing on roles that require access to sensitive data.
  - **Investigate File Activity**: Cross-reference with any existing policies regarding access to sensitive files and investigate any related activity that could indicate a breach or misuse of sensitive data.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a medium severity level because while not all access to sensitive file types indicates malicious behavior, unauthorized or unusual patterns can signify potential data breaches, warranting thorough investigation in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the logging level for Security Event Logs is insufficient or if network share access goes unlogged. Additionally, legitimate activities such as backup processes performed by Help Desk operators may trigger false positives. Adversaries may also employ obfuscation techniques or utilize legitimate accounts to bypass detection, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and context awareness in investigations.

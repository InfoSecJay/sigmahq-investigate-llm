  ### Technical Context
  The "T1047 Wmiprvse Wbemcomn DLL Hijack" detection rule identifies potential malicious activities related to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) by monitoring for the network creation of a file named `wbemcomn.dll` within the `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\` directory. This technique is typically used by threat actors to execute arbitrary code, enabling lateral movement within the network by leveraging WMI functionalities. The detection rule focuses on Event ID 5145, which logs network file access attempts, particularly from accounts with administrative privileges that end with a dollar sign (`$`), indicating they are likely service accounts. The events must not also relate to common legitimate administrative functions, which helps minimize false positives. The rule is part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Execution tactic (TA0002) and the technique T1047, which pertains to WMI hijacking as a means of lateral movement (T1021.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Event Logs**: Use Windows Security event logs to correlate Event ID 5145 with the creation of `wbemcomn.dll`. Look for additional anomalous activity from the identified user accounts.
    
  - **Analyze Process Activity**: Utilize the EDR tool to review process creation logs around the time of the file access. Investigate if any processes exhibit suspicious behavior, especially those involving WMI or remote execution capabilities.
  - **Network Traffic Examination**: Inspect network logs for abnormal or unauthorized connections, particularly around the time the `wbemcomn.dll` file was created. Focus on logs from the firewall (NGFW) and any network detection solutions (NDR) in place.
  - **Review Service Accounts**: Identify and analyze the use of accounts ending with a dollar sign (`$`). Ensure that any associated account is legitimate, and verify if the account has been used outside of its normal operational profile.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the increased risk associated with unauthorized file creation within system directories, which can lead to significant security incidents such as remote code execution and unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are scenarios where this rule may not fire, particularly if a threat actor uses a different method to deploy the hijack, such as a different file name or location. The effectiveness of the rule assumes visibility into all network activities and proper logging; if logs are missing or if the attacker uses steganography techniques or operates during fell-times, detection may be hindered. Additionally, this rule relies on accurate user account management; if service accounts are not monitored, they could be exploited without detection.

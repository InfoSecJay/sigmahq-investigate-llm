  ### Technical Context
  The "Unauthorized System Time Modification" rule is designed to identify instances where unauthorized applications or users are potentially altering the system's time settings. This rule specifically monitors for Windows Security Event ID 4616, which logs attempted changes to the system time. The detection is targeted at processes that may not typically have permission to modify system time, including common virtualization tools like VMware and VirtualBox. The rule filters out benign processes such as `vmtoolsd.exe`, `VBoxService.exe`, and `msoobe.exe` to reduce false positives and focuses on changes initiated through `svchost.exe` by the user identified as Local Service (SubjectUserSid: 'S-1-5-19'). This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1070.006 (Indicator Removal on Host: Timestomp) and falls under the defense evasion tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check the Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4616 occurrences, specifically focusing on timestamps and correlated modifications around the alert times.
  - **Process Analysis:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate the processes initiated during the detection window, particularly looking for suspicious instances of `svchost.exe` and examining their command-line arguments.
  - **User Context Verification:** Cross-reference the SubjectUserSid reported in the event against known user accounts and privileges to assess if unauthorized modifications were made by a legitimate account.
  - **Network Activity Review:** Investigate any associated network connections from the time of the event using network detection tools to determine if the modification correlates with external communication, such as command and control (C2) traffic.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as low severity because, while unauthorized time changes can indicate malicious activity, they may also arise from legitimate system processes in certain virtualization environments. However, they still require investigation to rule out any potential threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger in environments using virtualization technologies or if unauthorized processes do not correlate with the listed filters. Additionally, if systems do not have the necessary audit policies enabled for security state changes, the rule will not capture relevant events. It's also important to note that attackers may use custom scripts or binaries that are not represented in the current filters, allowing them to evade detection during time alteration attempts.

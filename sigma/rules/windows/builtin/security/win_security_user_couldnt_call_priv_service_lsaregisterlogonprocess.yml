title: User Couldn't Call a Privileged Service 'LsaRegisterLogonProcess'
id: 6daac7fc-77d1-449a-a71a-e6b4d59a0e54
status: test
description: The 'LsaRegisterLogonProcess' function verifies that the application
  making the function call is a logon process by checking that it has the SeTcbPrivilege
  privilege set. Possible Rubeus tries to get a handle to LSA.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule identified as "User Couldn't Call a Privileged Service 'LsaRegisterLogonProcess'" is designed to detect unauthorized attempts to use the LsaRegisterLogonProcess function, which is integral to the Windows security architecture for logon processes. This function verifies that the calling application has the required SeTcbPrivilege privilege. When an application attempts to invoke this function without the necessary permissions, it generates an EventID of 4673 in the Windows Security logs. The detection focuses on identifying when such an invocation fails, potentially indicating malicious behavior, such as attempts by adversaries (e.g., using tools like Rubeus) to gain access to the Local Security Authority (LSA) for credential dumping or lateral movement.
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of lateral movement (T1075) and privilege escalation (T1558.003), as it specifically targets unauthorized privilege escalations through service manipulation. The sources of telemetry for this detection come from Windows Security logs, specifically monitoring for EventID 4673 associated with the LsaRegisterLogonProcess service.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Logs:** Investigate the Windows Security logs for EventID 4673, focusing on the parameters surrounding the failed invocation attempts to determine the identity of the user or process involved.
  - **Cross-Reference with EDR:** Use EDR tools to trace the process lineage and behavior of the application that triggered the alert, searching for any suspicious activity or command-line arguments associated with credential access attempts.
  - **Review Privilege Assignments:** Assess the privileges of the user account or process involved in the event, checking for anomalies in user permissions related to privilege escalation rights.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Utilize network detection tools to analyze any outbound connections made near the time of the alert, which may indicate attempts to communicate with external systems for data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity due to the potential for significant impact on sensitive credentials, as well as its implications for an ongoing attack where an adversary may already hold an elevated position within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the attacker uses methods to bypass privilege checks or if the logging level does not capture these specific failed attempts. Additionally, environmental factors, such as misconfiguration of auditing settings or absence of relevant event generation, might lead to false negatives. It is assumed that the monitoring environment is properly configured to capture Windows security events and that no legitimate administrative actions are taken around the same time frame that might lead to false positives.

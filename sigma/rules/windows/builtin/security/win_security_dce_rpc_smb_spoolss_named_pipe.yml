title: DCERPC SMB Spoolss Named Pipe
id: 214e8f95-100a-4e04-bb31-ef6cba8ce07e
status: test
description: Detects the use of the spoolss named pipe over SMB. This can be used
  to trigger the authentication via NTLM of any machine that has the spoolservice
  enabled.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify instances of the Spoolss named pipe being accessed over SMB (Server Message Block) connections. The rule specifically looks for Windows Security Event ID 5145, which logs whenever a network share is accessed, in this case, when the Spoolss service is invoked at the IPC$ share location. This behavior can potentially indicate lateral movement tactics used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the print system, leading to NTLM authentication attempts against unsuspecting machines. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic for this rule falls under "Lateral Movement" with the specific technique T1021.002. By monitoring for these patterns, SOC analysts can detect and respond to suspicious activity aimed at exploiting domain services.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 5145 entries that match the criteria specified in the rule, paying particular attention to the source and target machines involved.
  - **Correlate EDR Alerts:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze any correlated alerts for suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts to shared resources, especially focusing on the identified machines.
  - **Examine Network Traffic:** Use Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to monitor SMB traffic associated with the identified named pipe access, looking for unusual patterns or significant data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Conduct User Assessment:** Review the authentication logs to identify the accounts involved in the SMB access request, cross-checking against known domain privileges and roles to ascertain legitimacy.
  ### Prioritization
  The prioritization of this alert is medium severity as it indicates potential unauthorized lateral movement within the environment, which is a common tactic for lateral attacks, and requires prompt investigation to determine if a compromise has occurred.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where the spoolss service is disabled or not utilized, leading to a potential gap in detection for those scenarios. It also assumes that access to the named pipe will always be logged without evasion techniques like log deletion or event filtering by the adversary. Additionally, false positives may occur in legitimate use cases involving domain controllers acting as print servers.

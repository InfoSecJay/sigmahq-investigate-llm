  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets reconnaissance activities performed by adversaries to enumerate privileged user accounts or groups in an Active Directory (AD) environment. By monitoring Windows Security logs for Event ID 4661, the rule looks specifically for access operations on SAM (Security Account Manager) objects, such as user and group accounts with high privilege levels. The detection identifies common Distinguished Names (DNs) associated with privileged accounts, including built-in administrative users and groups (e.g., `-500`, `-512`, etc.). The logs must originate from Domain Controllers where Object Access auditing for the SAM should be enabled. This rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1087.002 (Account Discovery: Domain Account).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Logs**: Check the Windows Security logs on the Domain Controller for Event ID 4661 occurrences during the alert timeframe. Look for the ObjectName and SubjectUserName fields to identify the accounts involved in the access.
  - **Cross-reference Accounts**: Compare the accessed accounts against your organizationâ€™s privileged user or group listings. Focus on any unfamiliar account access or usage patterns.
  - **Assess User Activity**: Use EDR tools to analyze the behavior of the SubjectUserName to confirm if their activity correlates with typical operations or appears suspicious based on the context of their role.
  - **Review Previous Incidents**: Investigate any related security incidents or alerts associated with the account in question. Historical context can provide valuable insights into whether the current activity is consistent with usual account behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential impact of compromised privileged accounts, this alert has a high severity level. Discovery and enumeration of these accounts may indicate preparatory steps for a more serious attack against the network, making it crucial to investigate promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule relies on the presence of Event ID 4661, which must be properly configured for Object Access auditing on Domain Controllers. If this logging is not enabled, the rule may fail to detect relevant activities. Furthermore, if legitimate users try to enumerate privileged accounts as part of their routine administrative duties, there is a risk of false positives, which can desensitize teams to actual threats. Finally, adversaries might attempt to obscure their activities through authorized accounts, which could lead to missed detections.

title: Azure AD Health Service Agents Registry Keys Access
id: 1d2ab8ac-1a01-423b-9c39-001510eae8e8
status: test
description: |
  This detection uses Windows security events to detect suspicious access attempts to the registry key values and sub-keys of Azure AD Health service agents (e.g AD FS).
  Information from AD Health service agents can be used to potentially abuse some of the features provided by those services in the cloud (e.g. Federation).
  This detection requires an access control entry (ACE) on the system access control list (SACL) of the following securable object: HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ADHealthAgent.
  Make sure you set the SACL to propagate to its sub-keys.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify potentially malicious access to the registry keys associated with Azure AD Health service agents, specifically targeting the path `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ADHealthAgent`. The rule utilizes Windows Security Event Logs, particularly focusing on events 4656 (handle creation) and 4663 (access attempts), which provide details about access to registry keys. By examining these events, the detection rule looks for unauthorized or unusual activity surrounding the specified registry path, which can indicate that an adversary is attempting to manipulate or extract sensitive information from Azure AD Health services. Given that Azure AD Health service agents are integral to the function of Azure Active Directory, any improper access could lead to serious security implications, including federated identity spoofing or unauthorized access to cloud resources. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic “Discovery” and the technique “Account Discovery” (T1012).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs**: Review Windows Security Event Logs for events 4656 and 4663. Pay particular attention to the account identifiers associated with these events to determine if they correspond to expected service accounts.
    
  - **Correlate Process Execution**: Use EDR tools to examine the processes that are linked to these access attempts. Confirm that the processes (e.g., `Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adfs.DiagnosticsAgent.exe`) are legitimate and authorized within your environment.
  - **Review Access Control Lists**: Investigate the access control entries for the `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ADHealthAgent` registry key. Ensure that the SACL is appropriately configured to prevent unauthorized modifications.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Utilize network detection and response tools to assess outbound network requests from the system. Look for unusual connections to Azure or other cloud services that may correlate with the unauthorized registry access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the sensitive nature of the data handled by Azure AD Health services and the potential implications of unauthorized access. Such activities could indicate an attempt to exploit the services for malicious purposes, warranting timely investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that proper SACL settings are enforced on the registry keys associated with AD Health service agents. If the SACL is not correctly configured to log access attempts or if security logs are not adequately retained, the rule may fail to trigger. Additionally, legitimate service operations or administrative activities might generate false positives, particularly if access is made during routine updates or troubleshooting processes. Adversaries could also employ methods to obfuscate or disguise their access attempts by using legitimate accounts or processes that are not monitored.

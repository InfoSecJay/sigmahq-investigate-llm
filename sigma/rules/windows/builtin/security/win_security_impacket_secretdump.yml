  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Possible Impacket SecretDump Remote Activity" focuses on detecting potential Active Directory credential dumping activities using Impacket's `secretdump`. The rule primarily examines Windows Security Event Logs, specifically targeting EventID 5145, which indicates file or folder access over a network share. It looks for access attempts to the `ADMIN$` share, particularly when the access involves directories associated with the `SYSTEM32` folder or temporary files with a `.tmp` extension. Credential dumping is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Credential Access," with techniques such as T1003.002 (LSASS Memory), T1003.003 (Credential Dumping via Windows API), and T1003.004 (Credential Dumping via Procdump). Monitoring these activities can help in identifying malicious actors attempting to retrieve sensitive information from Active Directory.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Suspicious Processes:** Investigate any processes that were active during the time of the event for indicators of credential dumping tools or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Use NDR tools to assess incoming and outgoing network traffic for communication patterns to known malicious IP addresses or unusual access to the `ADMIN$` share.
  - **Review System Event Logs:** Examine Security logs for related EventID 4624 (logon events) and 4625 (failed logon attempts) to identify any unauthorized or anomalous authentication attempts coinciding with the suspect activity.
  - **Inspect User Access Patterns:** Analyze Windows Security logs for repeated or unusual access attempts to `ADMIN$` by users who do not typically require administrative access, indicating a potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity level because it indicates a potential compromise of Active Directory credentials, which can lead to escalated privileges and further exploitation of the organizationâ€™s network. Timely investigation can prevent further unauthorized actions.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the successful configuration of the advanced audit policy setting for object access events, which may not be uniformly enabled across all systems. Additionally, if the actor utilizes non-standard methods to access these shares or if credential dumping tools do not interact with the `ADMIN$` share in a conventional way, the rule may not trigger. Environmental factors, such as the presence of legitimate administrative activities on the system, may lead to false negatives or missed detections.

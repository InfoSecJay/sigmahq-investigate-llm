  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the transfer of files containing credential data via network shares on Windows systems. Specifically, it looks for Event ID 5145, which indicates access attempts to shared files. The rule searches for well-known, sensitive filenames typically associated with credential storage, such as `lsass`, `sam`, `ntds.dit`, and others commonly used in credential dumping attacks. The presence of these file paths in network share activity can indicate that an adversary is attempting to extract sensitive credential information from the system and transfer it to another location in the network.
  The detection focuses on logs sourced from Windows Security, providing insight into who accessed those files and from where. Given that the rule targets credential access, it aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's tactics and techniques for Credential Access (specifically, T1003.001, T1003.002, and T1003.003) which highlight methods of retrieving and utilizing credentials from system files.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR/AV Logs for Indicators**: Review logs from endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools and antivirus solutions for any detection events indicating suspicious activity related to credential access.
  - **Analyze Network Share Activity**: Investigate the Windows Security logs for Event ID 5145 to identify the source IP and user account involved in the file access, and determine whether the access is legitimate or suspicious.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Examine user login/logout events and other activity logs to verify if the file transfer aligns with normal administrative actions or if it appears anomalous.
  - **Review Proxy and VPN Logs**: Check proxy and VPN logs for any unusual outbound connections corresponding to the timestamp of the access event, which could indicate exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium due to the potential for significant risk involving credential theft and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Given the nature of such activities, even legitimate administrators can inadvertently trigger this alert if they are accessing sensitive files, thus warranting careful investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are inherent assumptions within this rule, including the reliability of Windows Security logs to capture all relevant events associated with network share access. The rule may not fire when legitimate administrative transfers occur, which could lead to benign false positives. Additionally, events may be omitted if logging is misconfigured or if the files are accessed through different means (e.g., other protocols or tools). An adversary might also employ techniques to obfuscate their actions, such as renaming files or using alternative methods to access credentials without triggering security logs.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Sysmon Channel Reference Deletion" rule is designed to detect potential tampering with the Sysmon event logging system, specifically targeting changes made to the Sysmon manifest or disabling its logging capabilities. This is achieved by monitoring specific Windows Security events related to modifications of system objects associated with Sysmon. The rule focuses on Event ID 4657, which indicates that an object (in this case, referencing Sysmon channels) has been modified, as well as Event ID 4663, which indicates attempts to access or change those objects. The key elements it looks for include specific names of Sysmon channels and publishers alongside changes to their state (such as indicating that Sysmon logging has been disabled). The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic here is **Defense Evasion (T1112)**, which relates to the malicious modification of security settings to avoid detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Event Logs:** Review Windows Security logs for Event IDs 4657 and 4663 to confirm the occurrences of object modifications related to Sysmon channels. Note the source accounts used for these modifications, as they may give clues to the legitimacy of the actions.
  - **Validate Sysmon Configuration:** Use Sysmon configuration files and settings to verify if the Sysmon service is running correctly and to check for any unauthorized changes in the manifest. This may involve comparing current configurations against known-good baselines.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Investigate user account activity associated with the time of the event to assess whether the modification attempts correspond with known users or potentially compromised accounts. Assess privilege levels to understand if a lower-privileged account was used for such changes.
  - **Monitor Subsequent Activity:** After identifying any tampering attempts, continue monitoring for further attempts to disable logs or modify Sysmon settings, utilizing other tools such as EDR or SIEM solutions to set alerts on suspicious activity post-incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high priority due to its implications for security monitoring and potential malicious activity. Tampering with Sysmon could result in a significant blind spot in threat detection, making this a critical issue for timely investigation and remediation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the threat actor has sufficient privileges to make changes without triggering alerts or where there is a lack of event logging due to previous misconfigurations. For example, if Sysmon is already compromised or disabled, attempts to modify its settings may go undetected. Furthermore, high volumes of legitimate administrative changes may also obfuscate detection of suspicious activities. Engineers should ensure that logging is properly configured and maintained across all endpoints to reduce the risk of missing critical events.

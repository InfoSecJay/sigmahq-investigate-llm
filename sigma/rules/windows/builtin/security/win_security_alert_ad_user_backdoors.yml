  ### Technical Context
  The "Active Directory User Backdoors" detection rule focuses on identifying potential unauthorized access or control over user accounts in an Active Directory (AD) environment without directly using user credentials. This mechanism often involves delegating control privileges through attributes such as *msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo*, which indicates that one user or service is allowed to impersonate another. The rule monitors specific Windows Security event logs, particularly Event ID 4738 which signals a change in user account properties, and Event ID 5136 which tracks changes in directory service attributes. By filtering these events for the presence or absence of delegation attributes, the rule aims to identify unusual configurations that could allow malicious users to maintain persistence in the environment. This relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Persistence** and specifically addresses the technique of **T1098 
  - Account Manipulation**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Logs:** Analyze Windows Security event logs for Event ID 4738 and 5136 to identify any recent changes to user attributes, especially concerning *msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo* or *servicePrincipalName*.
  - **Review Account Permissions:** Utilize Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) to review the permissions and delegation settings for the affected accounts to understand the legitimacy of the configurations.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to assess user activity on the endpoints associated with the affected accounts for any unusual login or access patterns.
  - **Assess Group Policies:** Review relevant Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that might influence user account management and security settings within Active Directory to identify potential misconfigurations.
  ### Prioritization
  An alert generated from this detection rule is classified as high severity due to its potential indication of an advanced persistence threat where attackers manipulate account permissions to maintain unauthorized access or control over user accounts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several potential blind spots with this rule. First, if audit logging for account management changes is not correctly configured or enabled, the rule may not fire. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions, such as changes made by trusted IT personnel, could generate false positives. Moreover, if adversaries utilize credentialed access via legitimate accounts, they may modify accounts without triggering relevant logs. Assumptions include confident audit policy settings across the environment and that attackers won't use sophisticated methods to obscure their actions.

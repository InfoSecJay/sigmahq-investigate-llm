  ### Technical Context
  The "Hidden Local User Creation" detection rule identifies the unauthorized creation of local hidden user accounts in Windows environments. Specifically, it triggers on Event ID 4720, which indicates that a new account has been created. The rule focuses on account names ending with a dollar sign (`$`), a common convention used for hidden accounts like computer groups or services. Hidden user accounts are typically not intended for human interaction, and their creation could represent a tactic utilized by adversaries as part of their persistence strategy. This alert is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence, specifically the technique T1136.001, which refers to the creation of a local account.
  Data sources involved in this detection include Windows Security event logs, focusing on account creation events that may indicate potential misuse of administrative privileges or malicious activity. Incident responders should closely examine the context of such events, as legitimate administrative actions may occasionally generate similar logs.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs:** Check the Windows Security event logs for Event ID 4720 to confirm the account creation details, including the timestamp and the user account that initiated the action.
  - **Assess User Creation Context:** Investigate the creation of this account by examining the user context (username, SID) and whether it corresponds with known administrative accounts. 
  - **Cross-reference with Other Events:** Analyze related events (e.g., Event ID 4768 for account logon) to determine if there were any sessions or authentications associated with the newly created account following its creation.
  - **Consult EDR for Activity Monitoring:** Utilize EDR tools to search for any suspicious activity linked to the created account, including processes started under the new user's context or network connections established.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential implications of hidden user accounts in maintaining unauthorized access, which can facilitate further malicious activities and lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the account creation event is logged but lacks the dollar sign naming convention. Additionally, if there are legitimate administrative changes to account privileges that include creating hidden users, these will not trigger the alert, resulting in potential blind spots. It assumes that monitoring captures all relevant security events without filtering out legitimate administrative actions.

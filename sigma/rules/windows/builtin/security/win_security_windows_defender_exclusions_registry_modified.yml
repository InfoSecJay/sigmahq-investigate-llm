  ### Technical Context
  The "Windows Defender Exclusion List Modified" Sigma rule is designed to monitor and detect alterations made to the Windows Defender exclusion registry key. This registry key allows files or directories to be excluded from Windows Defender's scanning procedures. Modifications to this key might indicate malicious intent, such as an attacker attempting to disable security measures to facilitate further exploitation. The rule specifically looks for Event ID 4657, which denotes that a registry value has been modified. The relevant data sources encompass Windows Security event logs, which capture registry access, and an audit policy that enables the monitoring of changes to the registry system access control lists (SACL). This aligns with MITRE ATT&CK's tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically technique T1562.001 (Disable or Modify Tools).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the relevant Windows Security event logs for Event ID 4657 to scrutinize the details surrounding the modification, including timestamps and user accounts involved.
  - **Review Exclusion History:** Utilize PowerShell to retrieve and review the history of changes made to the Windows Defender exclusion list, identifying any unexpected alterations or suspicious patterns.
  - **Verify User Permissions:** Investigate the user account that made the changes to ascertain if the user has the necessary permissions and if their activity is legitimate or unusual.
  - **Assess System Integrity:** Use EDR tools to assess the broader context of system integrity, looking for other signs of compromise that may coincide with changes to the exclusion list.
  ### Prioritization
  When the alert is fired, it may indicate potential bypassing of security controls, which is a significant risk in an enterprise environment. Immediate investigation is warranted as such modifications could facilitate further malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the registry modifications are conducted through a method that avoids logging, such as direct memory manipulation or if the logging of these events has been disabled or misconfigured. It assumes that audit policies are appropriately configured to capture these registry changes. Additionally, legitimate administrator actions for necessary exclusions could lead to false positives if not contextually evaluated. Analysts should be aware that advanced adversaries may use techniques to hide their modifications, rendering standard detection ineffective.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the execution of EDRSilencer, a tool designed to interfere with endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions by leveraging the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to create custom outbound filters. The rule specifically looks for changes to network filtering policies that contain "Custom Outbound Filter" in their names, which are indicative of EDRSilencer's operation to block outbound traffic from EDR agents. The relevant technical data sources for this detection include Windows Security logs, specifically Event IDs 5441 and 5447, which capture events related to the modification of network filtering rules. This behavior correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562 (Impair Defense Handling), emphasizing threat actors' attempts to evade detection and maintain persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Logs:** Review Windows Security logs under Event IDs 5441 and 5447 for any entries corresponding to "Custom Outbound Filter" modifications. This will help confirm the execution of EDRSilencer or similar tools.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use network detection and response (NDR) tools to analyze outbound traffic prior to and following the rule's firing, looking for anomalies or disruptions that may indicate EDR communication issues.
  - **Correlate with EDR Logs:** Investigate endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs to identify any indicators of tampering or manipulation attempts by EDRSilencer. This may include examination of agent status and connectivity issues.
  - **Review System Changes:** Check for any related process creations or changes within Windows Sysmon logs that may coincide with the EDR policy modification events, revealing further malicious activity patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential impact on an organization's security posture, as interfering with EDR solutions can allow threat actors to operate unobstructed, leading to data exfiltration or further lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several critical blind spots associated with this rule. Firstly, the rule relies on the Audit Filtering Platform Policy Change being enabled; if this auditing is not configured, the detection will fail. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries may employ alternate evasion techniques that do not trigger the specific filters monitored by this rule, such as using legitimate administrative tools for similar network manipulation without creating new filters. Lastly, this rule may not fire in environments that do not implement EDR systems or where EDR solutions have been completely disabled.

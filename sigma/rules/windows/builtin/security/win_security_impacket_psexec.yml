  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Impacket PsExec Execution" is designed to detect the execution of Impacket's `psexec.py`, a tool often utilized for Windows lateral movement and remote command execution during cyberattacks. This rule monitors Windows Security logs, specifically focusing on Event ID 5145 which logs detailed file share access events. The detection criteria look for network share access attempts targeting the IPC$, a special administrative share used in Windows systems for inter-process communication. This rule flags instances where the share name includes `\\*\IPC$` and where the target names signify standard input, output, or error streams typically associated with remote command execution via Impacket.
  The rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK framework within the lateral movement tactic (TA0031) and specifically ties to technique T1021.002, which relates to remote services such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and other remote command execution mechanisms. By capturing these events, security analysts can identify and investigate potential unauthorized remote command executions on their systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs**: Check Windows Security event logs for Event ID 5145 to identify instances of access to `\\*\IPC$` shares, paying particular attention to any corresponding user accounts involved.
  - **Assess Running Processes**: Utilize an EDR tool to investigate the processes running on the target machines around the time of detection, focusing on any unusual or unauthorized processes that may have used `psexec.py`.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Examine network traffic for connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains that may correlate with the event. Use NDR logs to assess the volume and nature of outbound connections from the affected host.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts**: Review other telemetry sources such as Sysmon logs for any related anomalies like process creation or image loads that could indicate further compromise or lateral movement.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity as it indicates potential unauthorized lateral movement within the network, which can lead to further compromise of other systems and sensitive data. Immediate investigation is warranted to determine the source and scope of the incident.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several considerations to bear in mind with this rule. The detection relies on specific configurations in the audit policy, particularly the monitoring of detailed file share access; if not properly configured, logged events may not be generated, and the rule may fail to trigger. Additionally, adversaries might utilize other methods for lateral movement that do not generate the same Event ID or may manipulate the logging to evade detection. It's crucial to assume that not all lateral movement attempts will be logged if obscure tools or custom scripts are used instead of recognized methods like `psexec.py`.

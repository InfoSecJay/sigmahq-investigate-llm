  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious file access attempts via SMB shares, specifically when a non-system account attempts to write to an administrative share such as `C$`. It utilizes Windows Security Event Logs, focusing on Event ID 5145, which logs file access events for shared folders. The rule looks for access attempts with a write access mask (`0x2`) to identify possible lateral movement by adversaries within the network. Such actions can indicate malicious intent, as non-system accounts typically should not be attempting to modify files in administrative shares. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Lateral Movement (T1021.002), where attackers may attempt to exploit SMB share access to further infiltrate a system or exfiltrate sensitive data.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 5145 entries that match the detected alert, focusing on the SubjectUserName to confirm if the accessing account is indeed a non-system account.
  - **Correlate with EDR:** Utilize EDR tools to identify the process associated with the SMB access and review its parent process to ascertain if the behavior is part of a larger attack chain or standalone action.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Use NDR tools to analyze SMB traffic; identify any anomalous or unexpected SMB communications related to the account in question and evaluate the duration and frequency of access attempts.
  - **User Activity Monitoring:** Investigate the current and past activities of the user account involved using identity and access management logs, focusing on any concerning patterns or prior alerts that might add context to the event.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential indication of malicious lateral movement tactics employed by an adversary. Unauthorized write access to administrative shares can lead to significant security incidents, including data exfiltration, system compromise, or further intrusions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if administrative shares are disabled or if logging for Event ID 5145 is not enabled on the target systems. Additionally, attackers could use legitimate accounts to carry out their actions, making detection through this specific rule challenging. Furthermore, the rule assumes that non-system accounts will be appropriately monitored; behaviors of trusted service accounts can create false negatives and complicate investigation efforts.

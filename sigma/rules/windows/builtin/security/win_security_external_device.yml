  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors Windows Security logs for event ID 6416, which is generated when an external disk drive or USB storage device is recognized by the operating system. The rule specifically looks for devices classified as 'DiskDrive' and those described as 'USB Mass Storage Device.' By capturing these events, security teams can identify when external storage devices are connected to systems within the organization, potentially indicating the transfer of sensitive data, malware delivery, or lateral movement attempts by adversaries. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Initial Access (T1200) and Lateral Movement (T1091), making it a crucial component of threat detection and response strategies.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Logs:** Check the Windows Security logs for event ID 6416 to confirm the occurrence of the USB device connection and identify the specific system and user associated with the event.
  - **Inspect EDR Alerts:** Utilize the EDR tool to examine any active alerts or suspicious behaviors that occurred around the time the USB device was connected, focusing on process creation and file access implications.
  - **Review Data Transfers:** Investigate any logs related to data movement, such as file writes, and network connections to ensure no unauthorized data transfer occurred using the USB device.
  - **Conduct User Activity Analysis:** Analyze the user's recent activity using privilege escalation logs or admin credential usage to assess if thereâ€™s any correlation with the unauthorized use of the USB device.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as low severity; however, it requires attention due to the potential security risks associated with unauthorized devices being connected to enterprise systems. Responders should assess the context of the event to determine if further investigation or action is necessary.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments where external drives are frequently used and monitored, potentially leading to a high volume of noise and false positives. Additionally, if a malicious actor connects a device that does not match the expected criteria (e.g., a device not classified as a USB Mass Storage Device), the detection may fail. Organizations should assume that highly skilled adversaries may utilize non-standard devices or evade detection by using built-in Windows features, such as disabling USB logging altogether.

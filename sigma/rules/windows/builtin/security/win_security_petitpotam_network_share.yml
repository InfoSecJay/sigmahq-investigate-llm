  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Possible PetitPotam Coerce Authentication Attempt" is designed to detect attempts by an attacker to leverage the PetitPotam vulnerability, which enables coercive authentication against Windows systems. Specifically, this rule monitors for event ID 5145 in the Windows Security log, which indicates file share access attempts. The key indicators of compromise in this rule include file share names that begin with `\\` and end with `\IPC$`, targeting the `lsarpc` service, and originating from the `ANONYMOUS LOGON` user account. These attributes are essential because they indicate an unsolicited access attempt potentially aimed at manipulating authentication mechanisms. This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1187, emphasizing credential access methods.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Details:** Review the Windows Security logs for Event ID 5145 and confirm the parameters such as `ShareName`, `RelativeTargetName`, and `SubjectUserName`. Look for unusual patterns, especially involving `ANONYMOUS LOGON` and access to `IPC$`.
  - **Cross-Check Networks:** Analyze logs from your Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to identify any abnormal network traffic originating from or targeting the affected system. This can help determine if an external actor is attempting unauthorized access.
  - **Check Endpoint Security:** Utilize Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to assess the host for any signs of compromise or lateral movement following the detection of the event. Investigate running processes and their origins around the time of the alert.
  - **Review User Activity:** Examine the activities and access rights of the account associated with the `ANONYMOUS LOGON`. Assessment of user permission changes may provide insight into whether this account was genuinely involved in the detection or if it's a false positive.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert involves the `ANONYMOUS LOGON` user and attempts to access sensitive services, it is high severity. Such activities could indicate an attacker attempting to exploit vulnerabilities for later steps in a broader attack, making timely investigation critical.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the audit policy is correctly configured to log detailed file share access events. If this configuration is not in place, the rule may not trigger reliably. Additionally, the rule may not account for legitimate administrative activities that could also generate similar logs. Attackers can obfuscate their methods by using legitimate service accounts or masquerading under different username contexts, which could lead to missed detection.

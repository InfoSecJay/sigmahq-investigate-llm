  ### Technical Context
  The "SysKey Registry Keys Access" detection rule identifies unauthorized access operations to specific sensitive registry keys associated with the Windows Local Security Authority (LSA). This includes monitoring for handle requests (Event ID 4656) and access operations (Event ID 4663) specifically targeting keys such as 'lsa\JD', 'lsa\GBG', 'lsa\Skew1', and 'lsa\Data'. The rule is particularly relevant for identifying attempts to calculate or manipulate the SysKey, a feature historically used to secure the SAM (Security Account Manager) database and encrypt user passwords. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1012: Execution through API, emphasizing the importance of securing registry access in the context of credential theft.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the Windows Security Event Logs for Event IDs 4656 and 4663, paying special attention to the timestamps and account names associated with the registry key access attempts.
  - **Analyze Source IP and User Agent:** Examine network data including proxy and VPN logs to identify any anomalous access patterns related to the user or host that accessed the sensitive registry keys.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize the EDR to look for any suspicious processes that may have been spawned around the time of the registry access, particularly those related to credential dumping or LSA memory access.
  - **Review System Changes:** Inspect for recent changes in system configuration or security policies which may have coincided with the registry access, particularly those that could permit unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to its association with potentially malicious behavior aimed at compromising credentials stored in the Windows environment. Unauthorized access to these registry keys may indicate an attempt to extract sensitive data that could lead to further intrusions or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not capture all instances of legitimate access or could be evaded by sophisticated attackers using techniques such as process injection or legitimate administrative access. Additionally, it may not fire if logging is not appropriately configured on all endpoints, or if there are changes in Event IDs due to updates in systems or policies. Analysts should be aware that legitimate administrative tasks can inadvertently trigger these alerts, necessitating careful context surrounding each alert.

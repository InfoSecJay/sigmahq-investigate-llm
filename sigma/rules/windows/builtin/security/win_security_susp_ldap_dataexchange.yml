  known for data exchange via LDAP by the tool LDAPFragger and are additionally not
  commonly used in companies.

  definition: The "Audit Directory Service Changes" logging policy must be configured
    in order to receive events. Audit events are generated only for objects with configured
    system access control lists (SACLs). Audit events are generated only for objects
    with configured system access control lists (SACLs) and only when accessed in
    a manner that matches their SACL settings. This policy covers the following events
    ids - 5136, 5137, 5138, 5139, 5141. Note that the default policy does not cover
    User objects. For that a custom AuditRule need to be setup (See https://github.com/OTRF/Set-AuditRule)

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious LDAP-Attributes Used" detection rule aims to identify potential misuse of specific LDAP attributes that are commonly unutilized within corporate environments but are leveraged by malicious tools like LDAPFragger for data exfiltration via LDAP protocol. The rule specifically monitors for Event ID 5136, which indicates a modification to an object's attributes in Active Directory. It targets certain LDAP display names—such as 'primaryInternationalISDNNumber', 'otherFacsimileTelephoneNumber', and 'primaryTelexNumber'—that traditionally carry minimal organizational relevance but can provide valuable information to attackers seeking to differentiate their command-and-control (C2) communications. For the investigation, it requires proper configuration of the "Audit Directory Service Changes" logging policy in Windows Security logs, creating a focus on unusual alterations that may suggest suspicious activity aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Command and Control (TA0011) and the technique for Data Obfuscation (T1001.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs:** Investigate Windows Security logs for Event ID 5136 entries that correspond to the specified LDAP attributes, focusing on the context in which these attributes are being modified.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Cross-reference the timestamps of the suspicious LDAP modifications with user activity logs, including recent logins, to determine whether any anomalous or unauthorized accounts are involved.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize the Network Detection and Response (NDR) tool to inspect network traffic for LDAP calls that exhibit signs of C2 behavior, particularly looking for connections that frequently communicate with external servers.
  - **Examine EDR Alerts:** Check Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) artifacts related to any alerted events that may relate to LDAPFragger or similar tools running on endpoints, looking for unusual processes or executable behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert targets potentially malicious use of LDAP attributes that are typically unutilized in enterprise environments, it should be prioritized as high. The presence of such alerting could indicate an advanced threat actor attempting to establish persistent access or exfiltrate sensitive data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the "Audit Directory Service Changes" policy is correctly configured in the Active Directory environment. If certain objects lack the appropriate system access control lists (SACLs) or if the default policy settings are maintained without customization, the rule may not fire on relevant events. Additionally, there may be legitimate business use cases for these LDAP attributes that could lead to false positives. Adversaries might also choose to obfuscate their activities by using more common attributes or employing encrypted transport to evade detection.

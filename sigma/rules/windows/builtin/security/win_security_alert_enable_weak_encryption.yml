  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Weak Encryption Enabled and Kerberoast" aims to detect instances where weak encryption settings are enabled for user profiles on Windows systems. This configuration can increase the risk of hash or password cracking, allowing malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to accounts. This rule specifically monitors security event logs for EventID 4738, which captures changes in user account properties. In particular, it looks for changes to the User Account Control (UAC) flags that indicate weak encryption standards by analyzing the previous and new UAC values. The detection is based on both the presence of specific patterns in the `OldUacValue` and `NewUacValue` fields, which denote various settings falling under weak security practices.
  This mapping is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001 (Disabled Security Tools), as enabling weak encryption can be a precursor to evading detection mechanisms within an environment. Investigators should assess the broader implications of weak encryption settings, especially in environments employing Active Directory, as they could represent vulnerabilities that adversaries may exploit.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Event Logs**: Use your SIEM to isolate EventID 4738 entries corresponding to the reported alert, focusing on the timestamps and user IDs involved in the triggered events.
  - **Review User Account Settings**: Investigate the user accounts impacted by the alert, checking their UAC settings and any recent changes to identify the potential introduction of weak encryption.
  - **Analyze Related User Activity**: Cross-reference activity logs from EDR solutions or Windows Event Logs to see if the affected user accounts exhibited any unusual behavior during or after the configuration change.
  - **Consult Authentication Logs**: Utilize logs from Active Directory or related services to examine any authentication attempts made with the accounts affected by weak encryption settings, looking for failed logins or unusual patterns that may indicate an attempt to exploit these weaknesses.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as high due to the significant risk weak encryption poses in facilitating unauthorized access through credential harvesting or cracking methods, potentially compromising sensitive data and systems within the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One of the recognized issues with this rule is that it relies heavily on accurate auditing configurations in the enterprise environment. If security auditing for user account management is not enabled or improperly configured, the rule will not trigger. Additionally, successful exploitation of an account with weak encryption may occur without the event logging sufficient changes to UAC settings, leading to undetected compromises. Further, an adversary may evade detection by manipulating accounts or leveraging privilege escalation techniques that do not alter the monitored UAC values.

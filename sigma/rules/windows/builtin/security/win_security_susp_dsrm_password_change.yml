  Detects potential attempts made to set the Directory Services Restore Mode administrator password.
  The Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) account is a local administrator account on Domain Controllers.
  Attackers may change the password in order to obtain persistence.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule detects attempts to change the password of the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) account on Windows Domain Controllers. The DSRM account is a local administrator account that is crucial for administrators to access the Domain Controller in recovery scenarios. Malicious actors may target this account to change its password, allowing them persistent access to the network. This rule utilizes Windows Security Event ID 4794, which logs password changes for user accounts within the Active Directory environment. Detecting unauthorized changes to this account is vital since it can indicate a potential compromise and an attempt to establish long-term access. This rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Persistence" and the technique T1098.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Logs:**
    Review Security Event Logs for Event ID 4794 to confirm the details of the password change attempt, including the user who initiated the change and the time of the event.
  - **Identify the User Origin:**
    Utilize EDR tools to trace the origin of the password change, focusing on the user's credentials and any suspicious activities preceding the event.
  - **Validate Change Against Policy:**
    Cross-reference the timestamp and user account involved in the password change against organizational policies and standard operating procedures to verify if the change was authorized.
  - **Analyze Active Directory Access:**
    Examine recent changes to Active Directory permissions or security settings that may have facilitated unauthorized access, ensuring no further risk exists to critical accounts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because unauthorized changes to the DSRM account can indicate severe security breaches, opening pathways for persistent access by attackers.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that logs for Event ID 4794 are being captured and that the domain controller environment is consistent. If logging settings have been altered or if the event is not generated due to system misconfiguration, the rule may not trigger. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions, such as the initial configuration of a domain controller, may produce false positives. Adversaries may also circumvent detection through privileged access or by encrypting logs.

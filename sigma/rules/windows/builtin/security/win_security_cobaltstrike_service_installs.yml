  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious service installations associated with Cobalt Strike, a tool commonly used for penetration testing and by malicious actors for post-compromise operations. Specifically, the rule looks for Windows Security event ID 4697, which logs the creation of a new service. It analyzes service file names for patterns indicative of Cobalt Strike usage, like the presence of 'ADMIN$' or the execution of PowerShell commands with specific flags.
  The detection mechanism relies on several key parameters, including the presence of encoded PowerShell commands, an attempt to execute scripts from an administrative share, or using a hidden PowerShell window. Given its capabilities, Cobalt Strike can facilitate privilege escalation and lateral movement within network environments, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1021.002 (Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares) and T1543.003 (Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service). The identification of such service installations is critical for mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and maintaining the integrity of enterprise environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Service Installation Details:** Review the specifics of the service installation on the affected machine using EDR tools, looking for anomalies in service description, path, and associated binaries.
  - **Analyze Event Logs:** Gather and examine Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4697 and correlate them with other events around the same time to identify potential patterns of malicious activity.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Use network detection tools to analyze any outbound connections from the impacted host, focusing on unusual or unauthorized IP addresses, particularly those linked to known Cobalt Strike infrastructure.
  - **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Utilize AV and EDR endpoint telemetry to search for indicators of compromise (IoCs) linked to Cobalt Strike and check for unusual PowerShell executions or administrative share access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for significant compromise associated with the installation of malicious services, which can facilitate lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistent access within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where logging for Windows Security Event ID 4697 is not enabled or properly configured, thus leading to missed detections of service installations. Additionally, if adversaries employ obfuscation techniques or utilize legitimate tools in a benign manner, the rule may fail to trigger. It is assumed that the IT team has baseline knowledge of legitimate services running in their environment, as known false positives can occur with legitimate service alterations.

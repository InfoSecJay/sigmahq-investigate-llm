  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect modifications to Group Policy Object (GPO) attributes, specifically looking for changes that grant privileges to user accounts, including adding users as local administrators. The focus is on auditing a specific Change Log Event ID 5136, which provides details about modifications to Active Directory objects. The rule hones in on the specific LDAP attributes associated with GPO modifications, such as 'gPCMachineExtensionNames', and targets particular values that indicate a potential security concern. This behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Privilege Escalation (Technique T1484.001), which can be exploited by malicious actors to elevate their access within the enterprise environment.
  The rule relies on the 'Audit Directory Service Changes' logging policy being enabled to capture relevant security events from the Windows Security logs. By monitoring these changes, security teams can identify potentially unauthorized privilege escalations, providing an opportunity for proactive incident response before an attacker can leverage these elevated privileges for further exploitation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Event Logs**: Utilize the Windows Security Event Logs to search for Event ID 5136 with relevant attributes changed, paying special attention to the values matching the rule criteria.
  - **Correlate User Activity**: Cross-reference the changes with user account activities, using EDR tools to investigate the SubjectUserName field and identify if the modification was authorized or anomalous.
  - **Check GPO History**: Use Active Directory tools to examine the history of changes associated with the GPO, ensuring that actions have appropriate justifications and approvals.
  - **Analyze Access Patterns**: Investigate subsequent access or actions taken by the modified accounts, leveraging network logs or application logs to discern any unusual or malicious behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity because unauthorized changes to Group Policy can lead to significant security risks, including privilege escalation and broader network access. Quick response is critical to prevent potential exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where the 'Audit Directory Service Changes' policy is not enabled, limiting visibility into GPO modifications. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities by authorized personnel may generate false positives. Adversaries can also obfuscate their activity or employ techniques to revert changes, potentially preventing detection by this rule. Understanding user roles and expected behavior is critical for accurately assessing alerts.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting "Security Eventlog Cleared" focuses on identifying instances where Windows Security Event logs have been cleared. Specifically, it watches for Event IDs 517 and 1102, which correspond to security log clearance actions, including command executions such as "wevtutil cl." By monitoring the Security event logs, this rule provides visibility into potentially malicious behavior or unauthorized activity. The historical clearance of logs can often signify an attempt by an adversary to erase traces of their actions, directly aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Defense Evasion (T1070.001), which highlights methods used to obscure adversarial actions. The data sources for this rule primarily involve Windows Security Event logs, crucial for establishing a baseline for normal and abnormal activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Log Cleared Events:** Check recent Alerts in the Windows Security Event logs focusing on Event IDs 517 and 1102 to confirm if any legitimate log-clearing activities occurred and identify the timestamps and user accounts involved.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate log-clearing events with user activity. Check for recent administrative actions or command line executions by the user accounts involved around the time of the log-clearing events.
  - **Assess System Changes:** Review related logs (e.g., Application and System logs) for any corresponding changes to the system or user configurations that could help determine if the log clearance was justified or suspicious.
  - **Engage Additional Security Tools:** Analyze outputs from AV, Proxy, and any other available sources to identify unusual behaviors or traffic patterns surrounding the time when the logs were cleared, helping discern any potential malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity level due to the critical nature of Event log clearance, which can indicate a significant security incident if performed maliciously. In an enterprise environment, timely detection of such activities is vital to maintaining security and preventing potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule provides significant oversight for detectably cleared logs, there are inherent limitations. For instance, legitimate log collection agent rollouts or system provisioning can also trigger these events, leading to false positives. Furthermore, more sophisticated adversaries may use alternative methods to clear logs that do not result in triggering Event IDs 517 or 1102, thus evading detection. Analysts should remain vigilant and consider context beyond just the flagged events to capture the broader scope of potential malpractice.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify the mounting of ISO images on Windows endpoints, as this action can be used by malicious actors to deliver malware or facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive information. The rule specifically targets Windows Security Event ID 4663, which provides logs for object access events, indicating when a file or object is created, modified, or accessed. By focusing on objects categorized under the "Security" object server and narrowing it down to objects starting with `\Device\CdRom`, the rule looks for potentially suspicious activities involving ISO images that could signal a security incident.
  One of the common motivations behind mounting ISO images is to execute files contained within, such as `setup.exe` or `autorun.ico`, which are legitimate for software installation but can also be vectors for malware. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Initial Access and the specific technique (T1566.001), where attacker campaigns have leveraged ISO files in their operations. The rule helps SOC analysts flag and investigate instances that may indicate the use of malicious ISO mounts used for credential theft or deployment of Remote Access Trojans (RATs).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review EDR logs for any alerts generated around the time of the ISO mount. Look for additional related activities, such as process creation linked to the mounted image.
  - **Examine Event Logs:** Analyze Windows Security logs for Event ID 4663, focusing on the specifics of the object accessed (ObjectName) and the user account responsible for the mount.
  - **Inspect File Activities:** Investigate the file paths listed in the alerts, specifically looking for any execution attempts of `autorun.ico`, `setup.exe`, or `setup64.exe` that originated from the mounted ISO.
  - **Network Connection Review:** Utilize network logs to ascertain if any outbound connections were made shortly after the ISO was mounted, which could indicate potential exfiltration or communication with a command and control server.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level is assigned to this alert due to the potential risk posed by unauthorized access stemming from the use of ISO images, which can be indicative of either benign user activity or malicious attempts to deliver payloads. Rapid response is necessary to distinguish between legitimate installations and potential threats.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to detect instances where attackers use less common or customized methods for mounting ISO files not captured in the Event ID 4663 logs. Additionally, if an endpoint lacks the appropriate audit policy configuration for Object Access, the essential logs may not be generated, leading to overlooked incidents. Furthermore, legitimate software installations using ISO files may lead to false positives, complicating the identification of real threats. Analysts should be aware that sophisticated adversaries might employ evasion techniques to avoid detection by renaming files or using alternative mounting methods.

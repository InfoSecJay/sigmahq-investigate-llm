  ### Technical Context
  The "Protected Storage Service Access" rule is designed to detect unauthorized access to the `protected_storage` service over the network, which could indicate an attacker attempting to exploit the Data Protection API (DPAPI) to extract sensitive information such as domain backup keys from a Domain Controller. The rule focuses specifically on Windows Security Event Log data, looking for Event ID 5145 that indicates file or folder access events. When combined with specific characteristics such as the ShareName containing 'IPC' and the RelativeTargetName being 'protected_storage', this rule aims to identify lateral movement within the network that aligns with tactics outlined in MITRE ATT&CK under the lateral movement (T1021.002) technique. Detecting this type of access is critical as it can reveal potential abuse of legitimate system functionalities by adversaries.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Event Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 5145 around the time of the alert to gather details about the accessing account, source IP, and related activity.
  - **Correlate EDR Alerts:** Use your EDR to analyze any alerts related to the user account identified in the logs to look for malicious activity or unusual behavior patterns leading up to the access event.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Analyze firewall and network flow logs to determine if any unusual traffic patterns or connections to the Domain Controller coincided with the detected event.
  - **Validate User Accounts:** Look into the identity and login history of the user account responsible for the access to ensure it adheres to expected behavior; suspicious access may indicate compromised credentials or insider threats.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a high severity level due to the potential implications of domain key extraction, which can lead to further exploitation and compromise of sensitive data, making it a critical component of enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if the unauthorized access occurs without logging due to improper system configurations or if an adversary employs techniques to evade detection, such as changing the event logging behavior. Additionally, if the protected_storage service is accessed through a legitimate user account, the rule may yield false negatives. Understanding the network environment and the specific roles of accounts involved will help engineers better assess the effectiveness of the detection.

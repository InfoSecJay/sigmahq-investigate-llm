  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect a potential DLL hijack associated with the Internet Explorer application through a malicious file named `iertutil.dll`. The rule specifically looks for Windows Security Event ID 5145, which details file share access attempts. A threat actor may leverage Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) protocols to create this file over a network, indicating an attempt to exploit the Internet Explorer application by replacing or modifying the existing legitimate DLL. The detection is further refined by excluding events where the file creation is triggered by service accounts (where the SubjectUserName ends with a "$"). This behavior typically points towards lateral movement tactics as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly techniques T1021.002 (Remote Service Session) and T1021.003 (Remote Services).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Event in EDR:** Correlate the alert against EDR data to identify the processes associated with the file creation, including parent processes and user context.
  - **Examine Security Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Security logs (Event ID 5145) around the time of the alert to see additional details, such as the source of the network connection and any related user activity.
  - **Confirm File Integrity:** Determine if the `iertutil.dll` file exists in the specified directory and assess its hash against known good and bad signatures using file integrity monitoring tools or antivirus solutions.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Use networking tools to examine traffic and connections made by the host involved in the incident to identify any anomalous behavior or further indicators of movement.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it indicates a significant security threat as it can lead to the unauthorized execution of code within a critical software environment, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate privileges or move laterally across the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection may not fire if the attacker is using a different means to deliver the malicious DLL (e.g., local installation instead of network-based) or if the network share access is not logged. Additionally, the rule assumes proper logging of Event ID 5145 is enabled. If the environment does not include adequate monitoring of Security Event Logs, there's a risk of missing critical indicators associated with this potential attack vector. Adversaries may also leverage legitimate administrative privileges or service accounts to hide their activities, reducing the effectiveness of this rule.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect instances of the creation of suspicious local accounts that closely resemble the well-known "ANONYMOUS LOGON" account within a Windows environment. Specifically, it captures events where a new user account is created (Event ID 4720) that includes the keywords "ANONYMOUS" and "LOGON" in the SamAccountName, potentially with additional spaces or characters. This detection targets the tactics under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly looking at the persistence techniques (specifically T1136.001, T1136.002). By monitoring Windows Security logs, incident responders can identify potentially malicious activities that may aim to establish unauthorized access or maintain persistence within the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs:** Check Windows Security logs for Event ID 4720 to confirm the creation of accounts with names matching the rule criteria.
  - **Correlate with User Activities:** Utilize your EDR to investigate the account creation's context, examining any process launches or system changes that occurred before or after the event.
  - **Analyze Account Permissions:** Assess the permissions associated with the newly created account to determine if it has been granted elevated privileges that could be leveraged maliciously.
  - **Check for Unusual Logons:** Look for associated logon events (Event ID 4624) to see if the suspicious account was used for any connections and whether these were to sensitive resources.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because the creation of an account resembling "ANONYMOUS LOGON" can indicate attempts to establish unauthorized access pathways or impersonate system accounts, which could lead to significant security breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are potential blind spots with this rule, including the possibility of legitimate administrative activities that may inadvertently trigger the alert, leading to false positives. Furthermore, if attackers use obfuscation techniques, such as altering the account names in non-detectable ways or using a logon method that doesn't generate an Event ID 4720, this rule may fail to capture those events. Incident responders should also be wary of environments with extensive automation or administrative use of such account creations, which could mask malicious intents.

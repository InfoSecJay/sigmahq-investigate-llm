  Detects scenarios where system auditing (i.e.: Windows event log auditing) is disabled.
  This may be used in a scenario where an entity would want to bypass local logging to evade detection when Windows event logging is enabled and reviewed.
  Also, it is recommended to turn off "Local Group Policy Object Processing" via GPO, which will make sure that Active Directory GPOs take precedence over local/edited computer policies via something such as "gpedit.msc".
  Please note, that disabling "Local Group Policy Object Processing" may cause an issue in scenarios of one off specific GPO modifications - however, it is recommended to perform these modifications in Active Directory anyways.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where Windows event auditing is disabled, specifically focusing on the changes made to audit policy configurations. It monitors for Event ID 4719, which logs changes to audit policies, indicating whether auditing has been removed (both success and failure). The rule is designed to highlight potential evasion tactics, where malicious actors may disable auditing to bypass detection mechanisms. By filtering out specific GUIDs related to other categories of auditing (like logon or process creation), the rule remains focused on relevant changes affecting overall audit logging. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically technique T1562.002, which underscores adversarial efforts to hinder security controls.
  To effectively utilize this detection, the SIEM must ingest Windows Security event logs, capturing changes to the audit policy in the environment. This enables analysts to respond to incidents where logging configurations could potentially impact the detection of malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Confirm Event Capture:** Review the Windows Security log for Event ID 4719 around the time indicated in the alert to verify that auditing was indeed disabled.
  - **Assess GPO Settings:** Use Group Policy Management to check the settings related to audit policies and see if "Local Group Policy Object Processing" has been disabled, which could explain the alert.
  - **Review Local Changes:** Investigate recent administration activities through EDR tools and Windows logs for any unauthorized changes made by users to the audit configuration.
  - **Cross-reference with Alerts:** Compare the timing of the disabling of audit logging with other alerts in the SIEM for any correlating suspicious activity that may warrant further investigation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered low severity; however, if confirmation reveals that audit logging was disabled without appropriate justification, it may indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activity, necessitating a more in-depth investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several recognized limitations to this rule. First, if the responsible party has adequate privileges but does not create an event log (for instance, altering the GPO settings locally without proper administrative logging), this rule may fail to trigger. Additionally, if audit settings are intentionally left disabled in certain justified scenarios (e.g., specific workloads), the rule may generate unnecessary alerts. Analysts should also be aware that adversaries may employ techniques beyond simply disabling auditing, such as modifying audit policies without generating alerts, which could evade detection entirely.

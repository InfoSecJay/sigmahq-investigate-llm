  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on detecting unauthorized read access to domain user accounts from non-machine accounts in a Windows Active Directory environment. It looks for specific security events, particularly Event ID 4662, which records attempts to read properties of user objects in AD. By monitoring logs for access events where the ObjectType matches the user class and the AccessMask indicates read permissions, the rule aims to identify potential enumeration activities performed by attackers seeking to gain insight into the user accounts within the domain. This behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactic of Discovery (T1087.002: Account Discovery). Monitoring for non-machine account access helps flag possible reconnaissance efforts during an attack.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Log Events:** Use the Windows Security log to search for Event ID 4662 and identify the source account attempting to access user properties.
  - **Cross-Reference User Accounts:** Correlate the suspicious account with known user accounts in your Active Directory to determine if the access attempt aligns with legitimate administrative actions.
  - **Analyze User Permissions:** Investigate the permission levels associated with the accessed user accounts to ascertain if the access was justified or indicative of a configuration flaw.
  - **Check for Associated Activities:** Utilize EDR and network logs to identify any additional activities from the source account that could suggest malicious intent or patterns typical of adversarial behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential implications of user enumeration activities, which can serve as a precursor to more significant attacks such as privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger in scenarios where the auditing settings for "Read all properties" permissions are incorrectly configured or not enabled. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions, such as those performed by IT teams configuring new users, could generate false positives, as indicated in the rule's false positives section. Understanding organizational practices and the regular usage patterns of service accounts is crucial to avoid misinterpretation of the alerts.

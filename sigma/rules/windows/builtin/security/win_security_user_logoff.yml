  ### Technical Context
  The "User Logoff Event" detection rule aims to identify user log-off activities by monitoring specific Windows Security Event IDs. This rule captures Event ID 4634, which indicates a user has logged off from a session, and Event ID 4647, which signifies that a user-initiated logoff has occurred. Both these events are recorded in the Windows Security log and provide essential information regarding user activity on the system, thus enabling forensic analysis and user behavior tracking. By employing such monitoring, SOC analysts can correlate logoff events with other activities in the environment to investigate potential security incidents, especially those concerning unauthorized access or user behavior anomalies. This detection is related to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Impact" and technique T1531 (Account Access Removal), as logoff events could signal the termination of a user session potentially involved in malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Logoff Events with Active Sessions**: Utilize the Security Event Logs to track any active sessions at the time of the logoff to determine if any suspicious activity was occurring. This can provide insight into whether the logoff was routine or potentially malicious.
  - **Review User Account Activity**: Access user account activity logs or EDR telemetry to assess the actions taken by the user during their session prior to the logoff. Look for any anomalies or heightened activities that could warrant further inspection.
  - **Check for Failed Logon Attempts**: Investigate any failed logon attempts or previously logged events leading up to the logoff. Multiple failed attempts may indicate potential compromise or an account being misused.
  - **Analyze Related Processes**: Examine running processes at the time of logoff, using EDR tools to identify any unusual or unauthorized processes that could have initiated malicious activity. This may provide clues to help understand the context of the user's actions.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is set to informational, indicating that while user logoff events are generally standard operational activity, they may need further investigation in the context of correlated events or unusual user behavior patterns.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the system lacks proper auditing configurations for logoff events, or if syslog collection mechanisms are misconfigured. Additionally, logoff events occurring due to automated scripts or legitimate administrative actions could lead to false positives. It is assumed that adversaries could potentially bypass detection by utilizing fast user switching or by executing processes that do not trigger logoff events naturally.

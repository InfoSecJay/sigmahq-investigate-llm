title: Azure AD Health Monitoring Agent Registry Keys Access
id: ff151c33-45fa-475d-af4f-c2f93571f4fe
status: test
description: |
  This detection uses Windows security events to detect suspicious access attempts to the registry key of Azure AD Health monitoring agent.
  This detection requires an access control entry (ACE) on the system access control list (SACL) of the following securable object HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Online\Reporting\MonitoringAgent.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially unauthorized access attempts to the registry key associated with the Azure AD Health Monitoring Agent, located at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Online\Reporting\MonitoringAgent`. The detection process utilizes Windows Security event logs, specifically Event IDs 4656 and 4663, which capture information on access attempts to securable objects. The rule identifies when an access attempt is made to the specified registry key while filtering out legitimate processes associated with the health monitoring agent. This approach aims to highlight suspicious activities that may indicate reconnaissance efforts by an adversary against the Azure Active Directory environment. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic represented by this detection is **Discovery** (T1012), which refers to querying information about services and systems that can potentially be exploited.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Security Event Logs:** Review Windows Security Event Logs for Event IDs 4656 and 4663 related to the specified registry key access, looking for unusual patterns or frequent access attempts from non-standard user accounts.
  - **Correlate Process Names:** Investigate the processes attempting to access the registry key using EDR tools. Validate if these processes correspond to expected legitimate operations; if not, further analysis is warranted.
  - **Monitor Azure AD Health Status:** Use Azure logs or monitoring tools to check the health status of Active Directory services, ensuring there are no current issues that warrant benign registry accesses.
  - **Assess User Permissions:** Review the access control entries for the registry key in question to verify if the user account attempting access is appropriately authorized and whether permissions have been misconfigured or manipulated.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of medium for this alert is assigned due to the risk it poses if an adversary gains unauthorized access to the Azure AD Health Monitoring Agent's configurations. This could provide vital information about the organization's identity management infrastructure, which requires prompt attention and investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments lacking a proper access control entry (ACE) configured on the specified SACL for the relevant registry key or if the monitoring agents are not deployed. Additionally, if legitimate processes are misconfigured or if they are compromised (e.g., through an attack that injects malicious code), they may not trigger the alerts as expected. Engineers should also consider that an adversary could use legitimate accounts to mask their activity, potentially evading detection.

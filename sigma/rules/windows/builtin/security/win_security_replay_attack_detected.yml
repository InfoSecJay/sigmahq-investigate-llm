  ### Technical Context
  The "Replay Attack Detected" Sigma rule is designed to identify potential Kerberos replay attacks targeting domain controllers. This type of attack occurs when an adversary captures and reuses authentication tokens (Kerberos tickets) to gain unauthorized access within a network. The rule specifically looks for Windows Security Event ID 4649, which indicates that an "KRB_AP_ERR_REPEAT" Kerberos response has been sent to a client. This event suggests that a replayed ticket has been utilized, indicating a potential breach or network compromise. Aligning with MITRE ATT&CK framework, this detection falls under the **Credential Access** tactic (T1558), specifically focusing on replay attacks to compromise user credentials.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Event Logs:** Examine the Windows Security Event logs for Event ID 4649 across multiple domain controllers to identify any additional anomalous behavior or patterns in the logs.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to look for any signs of lateral movement or unusual authentication patterns by the user account associated with the detected event, including executed processes or network connections.
  - **Validate User Context:** Cross-reference the originating user account with user behavior analytics to determine if the logon attempts appear legitimate or if there is a spike in access related to sensitive resources.
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs (NDR/NGFW) for any unusual or unexpected outbound traffic patterns, especially those involving Kerberos tickets and associated user accounts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because a detected Kerberos replay attack indicates an attempt to exploit the authentication mechanisms of the network, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There may be scenarios where this rule does not fire, such as if logging for Event ID 4649 is not enabled on the domain controllers or if the replay attack is executed in a stealthy manner that avoids detection. Additionally, legitimate use cases such as client device re-authentication or misconfigured system settings might trigger false positives. Understanding network behavior and having elevated logging settings in place can minimize these blind spots and improve the effectiveness of this detection rule.

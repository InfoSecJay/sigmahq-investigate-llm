title: Kerberoasting Activity - Initial Query
id: d04ae2b8-ad54-4de0-bd87-4bc1da66aa59
status: test
description: |
  This rule will collect the data needed to start looking into possible kerberoasting activity.
  Further analysis or computation within the query is needed focusing on requests from one specific host/IP towards multiple service names within a time period of 5 seconds.
  You can then set a threshold for the number of requests and time between the requests to turn this into an alert.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential Kerberoasting activity, which is a type of attack targeting Kerberos authentication in Active Directory environments. Specifically, the rule monitors Windows Security Event Log for Event ID 4769, which logs ticket requests in Kerberos. The rule filters for successful ticket requests (Status '0x0') for service accounts with RC4 ticket encryption (TicketEncryptionType '0x17'). It ignores requests for the krbtgt service as well as those ending with '$', which typically belong to legitimate service accounts. The goal is to flag suspiciously high volumes of service ticket requests from a single host/IP address directed at multiple service names within a brief timeframe, indicating a potential attempt to extract service account credentials. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access and the technique T1558.003.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query Event Logs:** Use the SIEM or EDR to query Windows Security Event Log for Event ID 4769 related to the suspicious host/IP to confirm the frequency and successful requests made during the indicated timeframe.
  - **Analyze Source System:** Investigate the source host's system for any unauthorized Kerberos ticket-granting service manipulations by checking for process creation logs or unusual command-line arguments related to Kerberos.
  - **Review User Activity:** Examine user account activity associated with the targeted service accounts in Active Directory to identify any anomalies, such as burst access or unauthorized logins.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Utilize the NDR tool to correlate network communication from the suspect host having a high number of Kerberos requests, looking for any unusual outbound connections or traffic patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity due to the potential for credential theft, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the environment. Immediate investigation is required to mitigate risks associated with compromised service accounts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the Kerberoasting activity is performed with low frequency or if attackers use various techniques to disguise their requests. Additionally, false positives may arise from legacy applications that legitimately request Kerberos tickets but are not properly accounted for in this rule. It is crucial for detection engineers to understand these limitations and continuously refine the rule to minimize gaps in detection.

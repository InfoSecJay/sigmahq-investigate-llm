  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential secure deletion activities on Windows systems using the SDelete tool, which can be exploited by adversaries to erase data in a manner that is difficult to recover. Specifically, the rule monitors Windows Security logs for event IDs 4656 (Handle Requested), 4663 (Object Access), and 4658 (Object Closed) associated with files that have uncommon extensions such as '.AAA' and '.ZZZ'. By observing these event IDs in conjunction with specific file extensions, the rule aims to pinpoint potentially malicious file deletion activities, categorized under MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as T1070.004 (Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion), T1027.005 (Obfuscated Files or Information: Encrypted File System), and T1485 (Data Destruction). 
  The primary data sources leveraged are the Security event logs, which create a trail of object access that includes file manipulations, thus allowing analysts to investigate system modifications more effectively. This makes the detection of secure deletion through SDelete relevant in scenarios of data exfiltration or breach cleanup where adversaries attempt to cover their tracks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify File Access Events:** Investigate the event log entries for the specific file extensions reported. Check for any unusual access patterns or behaviors that coincide with legitimate user activities.
  - **Cross-reference User Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate the activity with user account logs to determine whether the file accesses align with authorized user actions.
  - **Assess System Integrity:** Examine other system logs such as Sysmon or application logs for signs of abnormal process creation or command line arguments that may indicate the use of SDelete or similar tools.
  - **Review Recent Threat Intelligence:** Refer to the latest threat intelligence feeds to identify any known indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with the use of SDelete or similar file deletion techniques, which can provide context for the investigation.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as medium due to the potential risk that deletion of sensitive files may indicate an ongoing data exfiltration effort or a post-compromise cleanup operation, which could violate compliance standards and data retention policies.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses alternative methods for file deletion that do not match the specified object names or event IDs. Additionally, legitimate use of SDelete by system administrators for routine file management may lead to false positives. There is also an assumption that the log retention and audit policies are properly configured to capture the required events; failure in log configuration can result in the absence of crucial data needed for investigation.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious access to authentication tokens and accounts associated with the Microsoft Teams desktop application. Specifically, it focuses on security event ID 4663, which captures access attempts to the Microsoft Teams data directories, such as 'Cookies' and 'Local Storage', where sensitive cleartext information might be stored. The rule filters for access attempts originating from the Teams executable, ensuring that only anomalous activities targeting these critical data stores are flagged for investigation. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic "Credential Access" and technique T1528, which addresses the acquisition of credentials and access tokens.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Details:** Use SIEM tools to view the detailed logs of the triggered event, focusing on timestamps, user identities, and source processes to contextualize the alert further.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Leverage EDR solutions to investigate the behavior of the Teams application and any related processes during the timeframe of the alert, looking for unusual patterns or subprocesses.
  - **Assess User Accounts:** Check whether the user associated with the alert has reported any recent account compromise or unusual activity, which could help determine the legitimacy of the access attempt.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Use network detection tools to analyze outbound connections made by Teams during the time of the suspicious activity. Look for unusual data transmissions that could indicate token misuse or unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the sensitive nature of authentication tokens being accessed, which could indicate potential credential theft or malicious activity, necessitating prompt investigation to protect user accounts and sensitive information.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that monitoring and logging for Windows Event ID 4663 are properly configured and that the Teams application is used within the enterprise environment. It may not fire for legitimate access by system administrators or automated processes. Additionally, the effectiveness of the rule may be limited in scenarios where attackers deploy techniques to obfuscate their activity, such as running Teams in non-standard environments or using system impersonation.

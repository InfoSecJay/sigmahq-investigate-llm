  definition: The "Audit Directory Service Changes" logging policy must be configured
    in order to receive events. Audit events are generated only for objects with configured
    system access control lists (SACLs). Audit events are generated only for objects
    with configured system access control lists (SACLs) and only when accessed in
    a manner that matches their SACL settings. This policy covers the following events
    ids - 5136, 5137, 5138, 5139, 5141. Note that the default policy does not cover
    User objects. For that a custom AuditRule need to be setup (See https://github.com/OTRF/Set-AuditRule)
detection:
  selection:
    EventID: 5136

        # If you experience a lot of FP you could uncomment the selection below
        # There could be other cases for other tooling add them accordingly
        # AttributeValue|contains: 'B:828'
        # OperationType: '%%14674' # Value Added
    # As stated in the FP sections it's better to filter out the expected accounts that perform this operation to tighten the logic
    # Uncomment the filter below and add the account name (or any other specific field) accordingly
    # Don't forget to add it to the condition section below
    # filter:
        # SubjectUserName: "%name%"
  condition: selection
falsepositives:
- Modifications in the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute can be done legitimately by
  the Azure AD Connect synchronization account or the ADFS service account. These
  accounts can be added as Exceptions. (From elastic FP section)

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potentially malicious modifications to Active Directory (AD) objects, specifically targeting the addition of shadow credentials. Shadow credentials are often utilized by attackers to maintain persistent access to compromised systems. The rule primarily looks for Windows Security Event ID 5136, which indicates that an attribute of an AD object has been changed. It specifically monitors the `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute, which, when modified in unauthorized ways, raises concerns about credential abuse. The logging policy for "Audit Directory Service Changes" must be configured to generate relevant audit events, ensuring that the organization's security posture is enhanced against credential theft. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the tactics of "Credential Access" (TA0006) and the technique "Manipulation of Credential Material" (T1556).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Event Context**: Check the event details associated with Event ID 5136 in the Windows Security logs to ascertain the source of the modification, including the user and timestamp.
  - **Cross-reference User Accounts**: Investigate the account that performed the change against your organization's policies to determine if it is a legitimate account or if it appears in the false positives filter.
  - **Audit AD Permissions**: Review the permissions for the affected AD object to assess whether appropriate access control measures are in place and identify potential privilege escalation paths.
  - **Check for Additional Related Events**: Search for other relevant security events (e.g., Event IDs 5137, 5138, 5139, 5141) within the same timeframe to uncover any further suspicious modifications or concurrent access patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of unauthorized changes to AD objects, which can indicate ongoing attacks or compromise attempts that threaten the integrity of organizational credentials.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if audit logging is not adequately configured for the relevant AD objects, specifically if SACLs are not properly set for user accounts. Additionally, legitimate activities by tools such as Azure AD Connect or services like ADFS may produce false positives, necessitating an understanding of expected operational behavior. Engineers should be aware that sophisticated adversaries may evade detection through legitimate use of administrative accounts or custom scripts.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of NoFilter, a tool used to exploit the Windows Filtering Platform for privilege escalation by manipulating specific policy names. The rule leverages Windows Security event logs, focusing on EventID 5447 and 5449, which capture changes to filtering policies and context when those changes occur. The detection targets instances where the filter name or context name contains 'RonPolicy', indicating that an unauthorized or malicious tool could be altering system behavior for elevated privileges. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques under privilege escalation (T1134) and specifically the use of exploitation frameworks (T1134.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs**: Check Windows Security event logs for EventID 5447 and 5449 that match the 'RonPolicy' filter indicator to confirm the execution of the NoFilter tool.
  - **Analyze Process Activity**: Utilize the EDR to investigate the process tree associated with the detected events, looking for any suspicious parent-child relationships or unknown executables.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators**: Look in the Sysmon logs for related events like process creation, network connections, and file access that might correlate with the alert, which can give context to the behavior observed.
  - **Assess System Configuration**: Review system configurations and existing policies using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to determine whether unauthorized changes have been made that could suggest further compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because the execution of tools like NoFilter indicates a potential attempt at privilege escalation, which could lead to broader system compromise and data exfiltration in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the filtering policy change audit is not correctly enabled or if the adversary uses obfuscation to hide the tool's activity under different policy names. Additionally, it assumes that the specific EventIDs (5447 and 5449) are generated under all interactions with the Windows Filtering Platform, which may not always be the case, especially in customized or restricted environments.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Locked Workstation" detection rule monitors for Windows Security Event ID 4800, which signifies that a workstation session has been locked due to inactivity. The rule functions by identifying events where users' active sessions are automatically locked after a predetermined period, a common behavior in secure environments to mitigate unauthorized access when users step away from their devices. By tracking these events, we can evaluate practices concerning workstation usage and identify potential lapses in security protocolsâ€”a critical consideration within the framework of the MITRE ATT&CK strategy under the tactic of "Impact," particularly related to session hijacking or unauthorized access risks.
  This detection rule primarily relies on Windows Security event logs, specifically collecting data that displays when a session lock is triggered. This data is relevant to incident responders as it can provide insight into user activities, especially in environments where workstation access and user behavior are critical for maintaining security integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs for Event ID 4800 to ascertain the user accounts and devices associated with the locked sessions. Identify any patterns indicating excessive locking or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **User Activity Assessment:** Investigate the times and frequency of locked workstation events to assess standard user behavior. Cross-reference with user logs from EDR to detect any related activity that could indicate malicious intent or insider threats.
  - **Review Historical Data:** Analyze historical data around the time of the locked workstation event. Use SIEM tools to correlate this event with other security-related logs, including failed login attempts or unusual network connections.
  - **Endpoint Monitoring:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the state of computers that experienced session locks. Look for any suspicious processes or unauthorized software that may have been running prior to the session lock event.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as informational due to its nature of normal operational behavior; however, repeated occurrences or patterns may indicate security concerns that warrant further investigation in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule is based on the assumption that all workstations have session locking configured to trigger automatically after inactivity. Adversaries could bypass this detection by using screensavers that do not trigger the locking mechanism or manipulating user settings. Additionally, the rule may not fire if a user manually locks their workstation or if system audit policies are configured ineffectively. Ensure that logging settings are correctly implemented across all endpoints to enhance detection accuracy.

  ### Technical Context
  This rule is designed to detect instances when a workstation session becomes locked automatically due to a designated period of inactivity, as indicated by Windows Event ID 4800. The detection focuses on the security logs from Windows systems, which log events that highlight when a user session is locked. This can occur for various reasons, including organizational security policies that require session locking after inactivity to prevent unauthorized access. By monitoring these locked session events, incident responders can ensure that users are adhering to security protocols and potentially identify unintentional or unauthorized access attempts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Examine recent event logs in the EDR tool for Event ID 4800 to confirm the locked workstation sessions and correlate the times with user activity logs.
  - Review the userâ€™s activity leading up to the lock event using process creation logs to identify any suspicious applications or processes that may have contributed to inactivity.
  - Check network activity through the NGFW or Proxy logs during the period preceding the lock event to ascertain whether any unauthorized connections were attempted.
  - Investigate user access patterns in cloud platforms (such as AWS, GCP, or Azure) to determine if any anomalous or unauthorized access occurred corresponding with the time of the locked session.

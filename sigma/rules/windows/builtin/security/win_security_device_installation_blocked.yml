  ### Technical Context
  The "Device Installation Blocked" rule is designed to detect instances where the installation of a device is prohibited by system policies on Windows platforms. It primarily leverages Security Event ID 6423, which is generated when a device installation action is attempted but subsequently blocked due to the enforcement of policies defined in group policy settings or local security policies on the system. This event is critical in identifying potential unauthorized device installations which could lead to security vulnerabilities or data breaches. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Initial Access" tactic (T1200), indicating a possible technique utilized by adversaries to compromise a system.
  By monitoring Event ID 6423, the rule aims to highlight any attempts to bypass device installation policies, allowing security teams to review the context of these actions. Analysts can correlate this data with other telemetry sources to detail the behavior surrounding blocked installations, providing insights into potential malicious intent or misconfigurations that may need further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs:** Analyze Windows Security logs, focusing on Event ID 6423 logs around the same timeframe of the alert to understand the specific device that was blocked.
  - **Check System Policies:** Validate the current device installation policies to ensure they are properly configured and reflect the intended security posture of the organization.
  - **Correlate with EDR Events:** Utilize EDR tools to check for any related processes or unusual activities that may coincide with the time of the blocked installation, which could indicate exploitation attempts.
  - **Analyze User Context:** Investigate user account activities associated with the event, looking for patterns that may suggest whether the related attempts are legitimate or possibly the result of privilege misuses.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as medium severity due to its potential implications for system security. A blocked device installation may indicate an attempted exploit or insider threat which, even if thwarted, necessitates further scrutiny to safeguard against future risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several considerations that could affect the rule's performance. For instance, this rule may not fire if:
  - Event logging for device installations is not appropriately configured, resulting in unlogged attempts.
  - Legitimate device installations are being executed outside of established policies without detection, potentially masking malicious actor behaviors.
  - The rule assumes that all blocked installations are meaningful, yet some may represent harmless actions or errors due to administrative changes in policies. 
  Understanding these blind spots is essential for incident responders to contextualize the alerts and adjust monitoring strategies accordingly, ensuring a comprehensive defense posture.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Access To ADMIN$ Network Share" detection rule identifies unauthorized access attempts to the ADMIN$ share, which is a hidden administrative share on Windows systems. This share allows access to the system's file system and is primarily used for remote management and administrative tasks. The detection is based on monitoring Windows Security event logs, specifically looking for Event ID 5140, which captures instances where a user attempts to access file shares. The rule filters out events that originate from computer accounts (identified by a username that ends with a '$') to focus on potential lateral movement by user accounts. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of lateral movement (T1021.002), specifically targeting unauthorized access to administrative shares.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check Windows Security event logs for Event ID 5140 to identify specific instances of access to the ADMIN$ share, including the username that attempted access and the source IP address.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Investigate the user's activity preceding the access attempt by querying EDR solutions for any concurrent process creation or PowerShell execution that could indicate suspicious behavior.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to analyze network traffic to and from the host that attempted to access the ADMIN$ share, focusing on any unusual connections or patterns.
  - **Validate User Identity:** Confirm whether the user who accessed the ADMIN$ share is legitimate and should have administrative rights, checking the associated user roles in your identity and access management solution.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is marked as low severity because accessing the ADMIN$ share can be a normal administrative function. However, any access by non-legitimate users or unauthorized accounts must be thoroughly investigated to mitigate potential security breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the audit policy for "Object Access > Audit File Share" is configured correctly to log both successes and failures. There might be blind spots if the necessary audit settings are not enabled. The rule may fail to fire if an authorized user accesses the share, leading to potential false negatives in cases of legitimate administrative activities or misconfigurations within the auditing policies. Additionally, attackers may employ methods to obscure their access patterns that could evade detection.

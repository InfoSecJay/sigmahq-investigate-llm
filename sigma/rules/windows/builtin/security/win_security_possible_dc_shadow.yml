  definition: The "Audit Directory Service Changes" logging policy must be configured
    in order to receive events. Audit events are generated only for objects with configured
    system access control lists (SACLs). Audit events are generated only for objects
    with configured system access control lists (SACLs) and only when accessed in
    a manner that matches their SACL settings. This policy covers the following events
    ids - 5136, 5137, 5138, 5139, 5141. Note that the default policy does not cover
    User objects. For that a custom AuditRule need to be setup (See https://github.com/OTRF/Set-AuditRule)

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Possible DC Shadow Attack" is designed to identify potential malicious changes to Service Principal Names (SPNs) for domain controllers. The rule leverages two main event selections from Windows Security logs: Events 4742 and 5136. Event ID 4742 captures modifications to the properties of a domain object, specifically when the Service Principal Name contains 'GC/' (Global Catalog). Event ID 5136 monitors for changes made to the LDAP attributes, identifying those that modify the servicePrincipalName attribute with a prefix 'GC/'. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically targeting the credential access tactic (Attack ID: T1207), which relates to the manipulation of the Active Directory services to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges. 
  To ensure effective monitoring, it is crucial that the "Audit Directory Service Changes" policy is enabled as it triggers the necessary events captured by the rule. This context is vital for understanding the sophisticated nature of the DCShadow attack, which adversaries may use to execute unauthorized changes to directory service objects, thereby compromising the integrity of the authentication process.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review Windows Security event logs (Event ID 4742 and 5136) for suspicious modifications to Service Principal Names on domain controllers, particularly those that include 'GC/'.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate the identified events with any known alerts related to unusual account behavior or privilege escalation attempts on the network.
  - **Evaluate Audit Policies:** Ensure the "Audit Directory Service Changes" policy is appropriately configured to capture relevant events and confirm that the SACLs are set for the objects relevant to the investigation.
  - **Identify Known DCs:** Compile a list of known domain controllers in the environment and compare the anomalous events against this list to reduce false positives and assess the legitimacy of the activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a medium severity level due to the potential implications of DCShadow attacks in an enterprise environment. Although not every instance of the event signifies a breach, it demands immediate investigation because successful exploitation could lead to severe security vulnerabilities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized blind spot is the reliance on properly configured SACLs on Active Directory objects. If SACLs are not appropriately set, changes might go unmonitored. Additionally, the rule assumes that the attacker's activity will generate these specific events; sophisticated adversaries may employ methods to avoid detection, such as modifying SACLs or using less common event IDs. Furthermore, if legitimate administrative actions inadvertently modify Service Principal Names in a manner consistent with the detection criteria, this may also lead to false positives, potentially overwhelming the investigative workload.

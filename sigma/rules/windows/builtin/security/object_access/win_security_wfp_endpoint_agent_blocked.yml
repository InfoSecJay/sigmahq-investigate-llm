  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies blocked connection events in the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) that specifically involve common Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent binaries. When a malicious actor seeks to evade detection, they may deploy techniques that disrupt or suppress the normal operations of EDR solutions, including utilizing WFP filters to block legitimate traffic generated by EDR agents. The rule targets the Event ID 5157, which captures instances where the WFP blocks outbound or inbound traffic. The identified EDR processes (e.g., `MsMpEng.exe` for Microsoft Defender, `CSFalconContainer.exe` for CrowdStrike) serve as indicators that unauthorized modifications or adversarial actions are taking place to manipulate security event logging and reporting. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562), where attackers attempt to conceal their actions from detection and monitoring tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR Logs:** Investigate the EDR logs available in your endpoint detection solution (e.g., CrowdStrike or Microsoft Defender) for additional context around the connection events to see if there were any processes attempting to connect around the same time as the WFP block.
  - **Analyze Proxy Logs:** Check proxy logs for unusual or unauthorized traffic that corresponds with the timestamps of the blocked connections, which could provide insight into the attacker's behavior or targets.
  - **Review Windows Security Logs:** Cross-reference Event ID 5157 with Windows Security logs to identify any related events that might correlate with changes in system configurations or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Correlate Network Traffic:** Use NDR or firewall logs to analyze external communication patterns. Identifying any suspicious outbound or inbound traffic may help to contextualize the reason behind the blocked connections.
  ### Prioritization
  When this alert is triggered, it indicates a potential active attempt by an adversary to disrupt EDR operations, which poses a significant risk to the integrity of the security monitoring environment. This is classified as high severity given the implications for undetected malicious activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the EDR agents are not properly configured to report to the WFP, or if the Traffic Filtering settings are not enabled in the auditing framework. Additionally, this rule assumes that the EDR executables are present and correctly installed on devices; if an attacker has replaced or modified these binaries, detection may not occur. Also, there could be legitimate reasons for WFP to block connections that donâ€™t align with known EDR processes. Engineers should consider scenarios such as changes in configuration, suppression of alerts due to policy changes, or the presence of other endpoint protection measures that may impact how this rule functions.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the creation of new trust relationships to a domain in a Windows environment. Trust relationships are significant because they allow users and resources from one domain to access the resources of another, and their addition is uncommon, making it a potential indicator of malicious activity. The rule specifically looks for Windows Security Event ID 4706, which is triggered when a new trust was created. The MITRE ATT&CK tactic associated with this rule is **Persistence (T1098)**, which describes techniques used by adversaries to maintain their foothold within a compromised environment. By analyzing event logs from the Windows Security service, security analysts can identify and investigate unusual domain trust modifications that may signify unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Trust Relationship:** Use Windows Security logs to review details of the Event ID 4706, focusing on the source and target domains involved in the new trust relationship.
  - **Assess Source Permissions:** Check the permissions and group memberships of the accounts that initiated the trust relationship using your Active Directory management tools, ensuring they had appropriate authority.
  - **Review Recent Account Activities:** Investigate any recent activity from accounts associated with the trust creation in your EDR logs to look for suspicious behavior or anomalies in their actions.
  - **Evaluate Domain Changes:** Cross-reference with other logs (e.g., DNS logs, system monitoring tools) to determine if the creation of the trust relationship coincides with any known incidents or changes in your environment.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be considered medium severity because while the creation of a new domain trust can be legitimate under certain administrative circumstances, it represents an unusual event that warrants further investigation to rule out potentially malicious configurations or compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the Event ID 4706 is not captured due to logging configuration errors or if auditing is disabled. Additionally, the rule assumes the trust creation events will be logged correctly and does not account for environments that may have legitimate reasons for rapid structure changes, potentially obscuring genuine threats. Adversaries could also use stealth techniques to avoid triggering such events, potentially defeating this detection.

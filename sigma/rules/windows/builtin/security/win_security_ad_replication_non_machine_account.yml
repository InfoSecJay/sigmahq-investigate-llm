  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential malicious activity associated with the Active Directory Replication Service (ADRS) by monitoring specific events in Windows Security logs. The rule targets Event ID 4662, which logs modifications to Active Directory (AD) objects, particularly focusing on AccessMask values that correspond to the granting of permissions to read credentials. More specifically, it searches for operations driven by non-machine accounts (e.g., service accounts or user accounts) attempting to replicate AD objects via ARDS. The rule filters out legitimate machine accounts (indicated by usernames ending with a '$' symbol) and key Microsoft Online (MSOL) service accounts, which are typical in hybrid environments. This aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Credential Access" and technique "OS Credential Dumping: Active Directory, Replication (T1003.006)", highlighting the potential risk associated with unauthorized credential retrieval through AD methods.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Collect Event Logs:** Retrieve relevant Windows Event Logs, focusing on Event ID 4662, from the affected systems. Look for entries matching the defined AccessMask pattern to pinpoint attempts related to ADRS.
  - **Cross-reference Accounts:** Verify the SubjectUserName field to determine if the account involved in the replication request is indeed a non-machine account and assess its permissions within the Active Directory structure.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize EDR and network monitoring tools to analyze any associated network traffic during the timeframe of the detected activity. Look for anomalous connections to AD servers or unexpected data transfers.
  - **Conduct a Historical Audit:** Perform a historical analysis on the account in question to review any previous alerts or unusual behavior patterns. Also, check for other possible entries related to similar activities to determine if this is part of a larger incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as critical due to the potential severity of unauthorized access to credential information, which can lead to further exploitation within the environment. Rapid identification and response are essential to mitigate risks associated with compromised accounts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses legitimate machine accounts or if malicious activity occurs directly on AD objects without generating the specified Event ID 4662. Additionally, if an organization has modified default auditing policies or uses non-standard environments that do not log these events, this rule may fail to detect malicious attempts. It's assumed that all necessary logging configurations are in place to ensure accurate visualization of privileged access requests.

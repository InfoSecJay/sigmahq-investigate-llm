  ### Technical Context
  The "Password Dumper Activity on LSASS" Sigma rule is designed to detect unauthorized access to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, which is critical for managing sensitive authentication information, including password hashes. Specifically, the rule identifies instances where a process attempts to access LSASS with a specific access mask (`0x705`) and an object type of `SAM_DOMAIN`, indicating potential illicit attempts to dump credential data. This activity is strongly associated with credential access tactics, falling under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1003.001, which concerns credential dumping from LSASS. Gathering this data typically involves monitoring Windows Security Event Logs for events with Event ID 4656, where the rule looks for unique characteristics of these access attempts.
  In a broader context, unauthorized access to LSASS can lead to severe security incidents, such as lateral movement within the network and unauthorized account access. Analysts can utilize this rule as a key part of their detection strategy to help identify potential intrusions that target password and credential harvesting.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Event Logs:** Access the Windows Security Event Logs and filter for Event ID 4656. Investigate the source of the access attempt and examine the parameters to understand the context of the operation.
  - **Correlate Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to trace the process that attempted to access LSASS, assessing its behavior and determining whether it was initiated by a known application or appears suspicious.
  - **Analyze User Context:** Check the user account associated with the access request. Determine if it is an authorized user and verify if the activity aligns with typical behavior for that user.
  - **Monitor for Follow-Up Activities:** Based on any suspicious findings, look for additional events or actions on the network that may suggest ongoing compromise, such as unusual service creation, network connections, or further credential access attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity because the access of LSASS is often a precursor to serious data breaches, enabling attackers to harvest sensitive credentials and propagate through the network, posing a significant threat to organizational security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are certain limitations and assumptions with this rule. It may not fire if the malicious process uses a different access mask or if the event logging is improperly configured or disabled on the endpoint. Additionally, some privileged processes may have legitimate reasons to access LSASS, resulting in false positives. Analysts should be aware that sophisticated adversaries may also employ techniques to mask their activities to avoid detection, such as manipulating the Event Log service or using kernel-mode drivers for access.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential unauthorized access attempts to a Windows domain via SMB (Server Message Block) using NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication, which is commonly exploited by tools such as Metasploit for lateral movement within a network. The rule specifically looks for failed (Event ID 4625) and successful login attempts (Event ID 4624) where the Logon Type is 3, indicating remote access, alongside a specific pattern in the WorkstationName, which should consist of exactly 16 alphanumeric characters. It also checks for Event ID 4776, which logs authentication attempts against the domain controller. These data points are crucial for detecting malicious behaviors as they align with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1021.002: “SMB/Windows Admin Shares”.
  This rule provides an additional layer of security monitoring by ensuring that unusual or suspicious authentication activities are captured, thereby allowing SOC analysts to focus on potential lateral movement and unauthorized access attempts. Utilizing Windows Security event logs ensures that the rule leverages foundational Windows security features to identify malicious activities in real-time.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Logs**: Start by using your endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to investigate the logs for machine names and user accounts associated with the alerts. This will help map out the activity and users involved.
    
  - **Examine Windows Security Logs**: Search additional Windows Security logs for any failed or successful login events related to the reported workstation name or user account. This can reveal patterns of behavior leading up to the alert.
    
  - **Check Domain Controller Logs**: Cross-reference logs from the domain controller for additional authentication attempts and observe any anomalous logins that correlate with the timestamps of the alerts.
  - **Investigate Network Traffic**: Utilize network detection and response (NDR) tools to analyze SMB traffic, looking for any suspicious remote connections or commands that correspond with the detected authentication events.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the criticality of unauthorized access attempts via SMB, which can indicate a potential breach or lateral movement within the network. Quick response is essential to mitigate risks associated with credential-based attacks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if authentication attempts come from legitimate devices within the network that match the expected characteristics or if the attackers use obfuscation techniques that prevent detection. Additionally, if the log source is misconfigured and does not capture the necessary Event IDs, alerts will not be generated. Responders should also be aware that certain types of Linux hostnames (up to 16 characters) may result in false positives due to naming conventions that do not conform to the defined patterns.

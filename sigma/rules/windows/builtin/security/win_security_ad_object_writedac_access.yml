  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect WRITE_DAC access to domain objects within a Windows environment, which can be indicative of unauthorized changes to Active Directory (AD) permissions. By monitoring Event ID 4662, the rule captures processes that attempt to modify the Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) of AD objects, as indicated by the specified Access Mask (0x40000). This can alert security teams to potential defense evasion tactics employed by adversaries, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Defense Evasion** and specifically the technique **T1222.001: Application Layer Protocol**. The relevant data sources for this rule primarily include Windows Security logs, which capture access and modification attempts directed toward Active Directory objects.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Events:** Review Windows Security logs for Event ID 4662 that match the alert criteria, paying close attention to the user account initiating the WRITE_DAC access. This can provide insight into whether the action was legitimate or part of a concerning behavior pattern.
    
  - **Analyze User Activities:** Investigate the account that triggered the alert for any unusual activities or patterns, such as time of access, frequency of modifications, or simultaneous activities across multiple accounts that might indicate a larger compromise.
  - **Review Delegation Settings:** Check Active Directory delegation settings to identify how permissions were assigned to the account in question. Understanding the context of the WRITE_DAC access can clarify whether it was expected or malicious.
  - **Assess Related Accesses:** Look for other related security events preceding the WRITE_DAC access, such as account logins (Event ID 4624) and modifications to group memberships. This analytical approach can help determine the overall scope of the potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as critical due to the potential security implications of unauthorized modifications to Active Directory permissions, which can lead to privilege escalation or lateral movement by threat actors within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger if the logging level for Active Directory is insufficient or if Event ID 4662 is not being collected properly from all domain controllers. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions could result in false positives if not contextualized effectively. Assumptions regarding user behavior should also be balanced with historical baselines, as an anomaly does not automatically suggest malicious intent.

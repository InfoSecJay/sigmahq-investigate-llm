  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying remote task creation attempts through the use of the `at.exe` command or its associated APIs while interacting with the ATSVC named pipe on Windows systems. Specifically, it monitors for Evidence ID 5145 in Windows Security Event Logs, which indicates access to shared objects, particularly those related to the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) services under the ATSVC namespace. Remote task creation is inherently linked to lateral movement and persistence tactics, as it allows malicious actors to schedule tasks remotely on target machines to maintain their foothold or to execute malicious payloads. The associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques include T1053.002, which describes scheduled tasks for remote execution. Two critical technical data sources involved are the Windows Security logs capturing detailed file share access and the specific named pipe interaction monitored through the Rule's configuration.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Windows Security Event Logs**: Query the Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 5145 to identify specific timeframes of suspicious access to `\\*\IPC$` and the ATSVC pipe.
  - **Correlate with EDR Solutions**: Utilize EDR telemetry to correlate the identified events and gather insights on process execution behavior from the affected endpoints during the event window.
  - **Examine Related Processes**: Investigate the command-line arguments and the parent processes for any discovered instances of `at.exe` to assess the legitimacy of task creation attempts.
  - **Cross-reference with Scheduled Tasks**: Use the Task Scheduler or PowerShell commands to enumerate existing tasks and check against newly created tasks related to the suspicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to its indication of potential lateral movement and persistent threats that could compromise further systems in the enterprise environment if not investigated promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the advanced audit policy setting "Object Access > Audit Detailed File Share" is enabled and properly configured; without it, the rule may fail to capture essential events. Additionally, attackers may employ unique or obfuscated command-line parameters or utilize non-standard tools that the rule does not target, potentially evading detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Reconnaissance Activity" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious reconnaissance behavior on Windows domain controllers. Specifically, it looks for events associated with querying user and group information within Active Directory. This is accomplished by monitoring Windows Security Event ID 4661, which captures access attempts to Security Accounts Manager (SAM) objects. The rule triggers on specific criteria, such as attempts to access SAM users or groups related to administrative privileges—in particular, users represented by Security Identifier (SID) ending in "-500" (the built-in Administrator account) and "-512" (the Domain Admins group). The technique is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of "Discovery" and techniques T1087.002, T1069.002, and T0039, emphasizing that such reconnaissance is often a precursor to further malicious actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Security Logs:** Check the related Windows Security logs for Event ID 4661 entries to confirm the presence and frequency of attempts to access SAM objects associated with administrative users.
  - **Correlate with EDR Events:** Utilize the EDR solution to correlate any flagged reconnaissance activities with further suspicious behaviors that may indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation.
  - **User Activity Examination:** Investigate the user accounts involved in triggering the alert to determine if they are legitimate administrators conducting expected activities or potential adversaries mimicking legitimate user behaviors.
  - **Network Activity Analysis:** Analyze network logs for any unusual patterns or connections originating from the domain controllers during the time of the alert, providing additional context to the reconnaissance activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is marked as high severity because reconnaissance activities such as these may indicate a prelude to an attack, suggesting that an adversary could be probing the network for elevation of access or exploitation opportunities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule may be limited in environments with high legitimate administrator activity, where benign actions could be misclassified as suspicious. Additionally, the rule relies on the accurate logging of Event ID 4661; should these logs be misconfigured or if advanced logging features aren’t enabled, significant reconnaissance activities might go undetected. Adversaries may also employ stealth techniques or change their tactics to avoid triggering this rule, further complicating detection.

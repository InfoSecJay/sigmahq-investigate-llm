  ### Technical Context
  The "Password Policy Enumerated" Sigma rule detects when an adversary attempts to gather information about the password policy on a Windows machine. Specifically, it identifies events where a handle to an object associated with the Security Account Manager (SAM) is requested, particularly using Event ID 4661, which logs when access is requested to security-sensitive objects. The rule looks for specific permissions related to password parametersâ€”indicated by the access type '%%5392' (ReadPasswordParameters). This attack falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Discovery tactic, technique T1201, which focuses on gathering information regarding system configurations and policies, potentially aiding an adversary in further attacks or exploits. The key data source involved in this detection is the Windows Security log.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event ID 4661:** Check for Event ID 4661 in the Windows Security event logs for the source process or user that initiated the handle request.
  - **Analyze Activity Context:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate the process attempting to access the Security Account Manager with other activities during the same timeframe, looking for anomalies or indicators of suspicious behavior.
  - **Inspect User Accounts:** Review the user account making the request to ensure it is legitimate and has a proper business justification for accessing password policy information.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Look through proxy and VPN logs to detect any unusual access patterns or login attempts from the user account involved, which may indicate lateral movement or validation attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level as enumeration of password policies could lead to credential theft or exploitation, particularly if leveraged in conjunction with other attacks. While it might not indicate immediate compromise, it is a notable behavior typically associated with pre-attack reconnaissance.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the event logging is improperly configured or where Event ID 4661 is not generated due to system misconfigurations or limited auditing policies. Furthermore, legitimate administrative actions by trusted accounts could lead to false positives. It is assumed that the environment maintains proper logging, and adversaries could potentially mask their actions by using authorized credentials or by disabling auditing.

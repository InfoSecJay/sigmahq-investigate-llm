  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the registration of a new logon process associated with Rubeus, a post-exploitation tool frequently used in Active Directory (AD) environments to perform actions like ticket-granting ticket (TGT) requests and lateral movement. The rule taps into Windows Security Event Logs, specifically filtering for Event ID 4611, which indicates that a logon process has been registered. It looks for occurrences where the `LogonProcessName` is set to `User32LogonProcesss`, a common sign of Rubeus use during credential access and privilege escalation activities. The noted MITRE ATT&CK techniques, particularly `T1558.003` (Credential Dumping: DCOM), provide contextual understanding of the attack methodology, relevant to the broader Tactics of Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation.
  Responders should be mindful that Rubeus can use legitimate logon processes, which can lead to potentially false-positive results. However, detecting its registration activity is critical in identifying unauthorized access attempts and mitigating further damage from credential theft or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Logon Events:** Check the Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4624 regarding logon events sourced from the same timestamp as the detection alert to establish the legitimacy of the logon process.
  - **Analyze EDR Data:** Investigate endpoint data using EDR tools to identify any suspicious processes initiated around the same time as the registered logon process, focusing particularly on those indicative of Rubeus usage.
  - **Examine Network Connections:** Utilize network traffic analysis to track any unusual outbound connections or internal lateral movement that correlate with the detection, potentially indicating malicious activities.
  - **Search for Anomalous Behavior:** Look into other telemetry sources, such as Sysmon logs, for suspicious process creations, especially any that involve interactions with user credentials or credential dumping.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential critical impact of unauthorized access to credentials and compromise of user accounts within an enterprise environment. Immediate investigation is necessary to prevent data breaches and further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the logon process does not adhere strictly to the expected `LogonProcessName`, or if Event ID 4611 is not generated due to system or logging configuration issues. Additionally, if other tools or custom scripts mimic Rubeus' behavior without falling under the defined heuristics, those activities may go undetected. Engineers should regularly review and update telemetry settings to ensure comprehensiveness and consider the evolving tactics used by adversaries to bypass existing detections.

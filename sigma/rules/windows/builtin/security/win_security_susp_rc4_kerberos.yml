  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially suspicious activity related to Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) requests that utilize RC4 encryption. Specifically, it focuses on instances where the Ticket Options field indicates that the TGS request is for a service ticket and the encryption type used is RC4, identifiable by the hex values '0x40810000' and '0x17', respectively. The logs are sourced from Windows Security Event Logs, notably Event ID 4769, which logs the events regarding service ticket requests. This rule is rooted in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Credential Access (TA0006) and technique T1558.003. The usage of RC4 encryption is often associated with Kerberoasting attacks, where an attacker attempts to crack service account passwords offline.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Details**: Review the Event ID 4769 details to determine the user initiating the request, the service for which the ticket was requested, and the timestamp of the event. Correlating these details helps identify anomalous behavior.
    
  - **Cross-Reference with Service Accounts**: Validate if the requested service accounts are legitimate users in your organization. Look for any discrepancies in usage patterns, such as unusual times or sources of access.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic**: Utilize your network detection and response (NDR) tools to look for any unusual traffic patterns related to Kerberos authentication, especially from the IP addresses involved in the suspicious request.
  - **Review System and Application Logs**: Analyze related logs from Windows servers and applications to identify any direct impacts or subsequent actions taken by the service accounts after the ticket requests.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is given a medium severity level due to potential risks associated with credential misuse and unauthorized access attempts that can lead to data breaches. However, the context of legacy systems or service accounts in use may reduce the urgency of the investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments using legacy systems or those configured with specific Ticket Options not captured in this detection. Furthermore, it assumes that no benign service accounts are misusing RC4 encryption in ways that would trigger this alert. Adversaries can also employ techniques to evade detection, such as using more modern encryption types to avoid triggering alerts related to RC4.

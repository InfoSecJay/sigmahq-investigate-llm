  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on monitoring Windows systems for a specific event where the Windows Defender Firewall service fails to load Group Policy, identified by Event ID 2009. This failure can indicate a potential misconfiguration or malicious activity that attempts to inhibit the functionality of the firewall. By capturing this event, security teams can view indications of anomalies related to firewall settings being altered or bypassed, possibly associated with attempts to evade detection mechanisms. The primary data source for this rule is the Windows Event Log, specifically targeting firewall-related events logged by the system. Analysts should be aware that while not every occurrence of this event signifies a breach, it warrants closer examination to rule out potential risks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Query the EDR solution for any recent alerts or events around the time of the Event ID 2009 to identify any abnormal process behavior that coincides with the failure.
  - Review Windows Event Logs in detail to cross-reference any additional related events that might provide context, such as changes to Group Policy Objects or user account modifications.
  - Inspect firewall rules and configurations through the firewall management console to ensure that legitimate and expected configurations are in place and that no unauthorized changes have occurred.
  - Check network traffic logs from the NGFW and Proxy to ascertain whether there were any external communications or suspicious activities occurring that could align with the timeframe of the firewall service error.

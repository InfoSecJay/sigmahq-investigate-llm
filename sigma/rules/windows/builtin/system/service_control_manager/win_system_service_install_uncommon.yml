  ### Technical Context
  The "Uncommon Service Installation Image Path" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious service installations on Windows systems. It focuses on unusual or suspicious image paths that may indicate unauthorized or harmful activity, particularly those that incorporate encoded PowerShell commands or utilize temporary directories. By tracking events related to service control management—specifically Event ID 7045—this rule monitors for new services being installed while checking if their installation paths denote risky behavior, such as referencing `\\.\pipe`, `\Users\Public\`, or `\Windows\Temp\`. Additionally, the rule checks for characteristic keywords and patterns associated with encoded PowerShell commands, a technique often employed by adversaries to obfuscate their intentions. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of persistence (T1543.003) and privilege escalation, indicating potential attempts to maintain long-term access to a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the Windows Security and System event logs for Event ID 7045 and correlate any reported service installations with the suspicious image paths identified by this rule.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine any related process creations that occurred simultaneously with the service installation, particularly looking for processes that might have derived from encoded commands.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Use NDR tools to monitor for abnormal network connections initiated by the newly installed service to determine if it attempts to communicate with external command and control servers.
  - **Evaluate Persistence Mechanisms:** Investigate whether the identified services have persisted through system reboots and check their configurations for any unusual settings or commands that could indicate an exploitation attempt.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered of medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized service installations, which can lead to persistence mechanisms being established by an attacker. An immediate investigation is warranted to mitigate any associated risks.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  Detection can be circumvented if an adversary uses legitimate or commonly accepted installations that do not match the defined suspicious patterns. Additionally, the rule may not trigger if encoded commands are not represented in the patterns provided, or if attackers use different means to install services. There is also an assumption that services are installed through the expected Windows Service Control Manager, meaning methods outside of normal API usage may evade detection.

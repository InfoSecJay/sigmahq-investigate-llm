  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the unauthorized installation of remote access tool (RAT) services on Windows systems, leveraging the Windows Security Event Log for system service events. By tracking specific events, particularly Event IDs 7045 and 7036 related to service installations and changes, the rule identifies the installation of services often used by threat actors for persistence and unauthorized remote control. The services of interest include well-known RAT applications such as TeamViewer, AmmyyAdmin, and LogMeIn. These applications can provide an adversary with considerable access to the compromised system, facilitating data exfiltration, system manipulation, or lateral movement within the network. By correlating these events with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Persistence (T1543.003) and Remote Services (T1569.002), security analysts can gain insights into potential malicious activity that aims to bypass security measures by leveraging legitimately installed software.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Service Installation Records:** Review the Windows Event Logs for Event IDs 7045 and 7036 in the Security, Application, and System logs to confirm the installation of the identified RAT-related services.
  - **Analyze Service Configuration:** Investigate the configuration of the detected service using EDR tools to assess the startup type, user permissions, and associated binaries to determine if they are legitimate.
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Utilize network detection and response (NDR) tools to trace network connections initiated by the identified services, looking for unusual outbound traffic that may indicate remote access attempts.
  - **Assess Endpoint Behavior:** Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to analyze the behavior of processes associated with the detected services, checking for known indicators of compromise (IOCs) or suspicious actions.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is set to medium due to the significant risk posed by remote access tools when misused, as they can be exploited by threat actors for persistence and control over compromised systems. Immediate investigation is essential to assess the potential impact and mitigate risks tied to unauthorized access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the adversary uses custom or less-common remote access services that are not explicitly listed in the detection criteria, or if the installation process is conducted in a way that does not invoke the tracked Windows Event IDs. Additionally, the rule assumes that logging is appropriately configured, and the relevant security events are being captured without loss. If logging is insufficient or disabled, the detection will be ineffective.

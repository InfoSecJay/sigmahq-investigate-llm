  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Service Installation Script" rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity related to the installation of Windows services using scripts. This activity could indicate an attempt to establish persistence on a compromised system, which is a common technique leveraged by attackers. The rule monitors Event ID 7045 from the Service Control Manager (SCM), which logs when a new service is created on a Windows operating system. 
  To classify an event as suspicious, the rule looks for specific command-line flags associated with common Windows scripting utilities, including `cscript`, `mshta`, `powershell`, `pwsh`, `regsvr32`, and `rundll32`. These command-line tools can be used to execute scripts that may clandestinely install or manipulate services, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence and technique ATT&CK ID T1543.003.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event History**: Review the Windows Event Logs for Event ID 7045 corresponding to the detected alert. Pay particular attention to the "ImagePath" and "Description" fields for signs of malicious service installation.
    
  - **Examine Command-Line Execution**: Utilize your EDR tool to capture related process creation events. Investigate parent processes and command-line arguments to confirm if they correlate with the suspicious services identified.
    
  - **Analyze Network Activity**: Query your network detection and response (NDR) tools for recent outbound connections originating from these processes. Look for any external IP addresses or domains that may indicate exfiltration or communication with known malicious hosts.
    
  - **Review System Integrity**: Conduct a file integrity check on the binaries and scripts associated with the detected services. Ensure no unauthorized changes have occurred that could indicate compromise or malicious behavior in your environment.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for unauthorized remote access or persistence mechanisms being set up by an attacker. Quick response is essential to mitigate risks associated with newly created services that could allow further exploitation of the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses alternative methods to create services or if the Activity is executed through methods not monitored by the Service Control Manager, such as local scripts without service creation. Additionally, the rule relies on the presence of Event ID 7045; therefore, if the Windows Audit policy isnâ€™t configured to log such events, it may result in missed detections.

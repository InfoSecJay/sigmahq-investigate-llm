  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule “Service Installation with Suspicious Folder Pattern” is designed to detect potentially malicious service installations on Windows systems that adhere to specific folder naming patterns commonly associated with evasion tactics by attackers. This rule focuses on monitoring the Windows Event Logs, specifically targeting events logged by the Service Control Manager (Event ID 7045), which records the addition of new services on the system. The detection logic examines the `ImagePath` of the newly created service binaries, searching for irregular or suspicious folder patterns, such as those containing numerous dots or leading slashes, which may indicate attempts to disguise malicious executables. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence and the associated technique T1543.003, targeting the creation of Windows services.
  To accurately trigger an alert, the rule leverages event logs from the Windows System category alongside filtered regular expressions that identify path anomalies. These signal potential indicators of compromise as attackers may use unconventional folder structures to make the malicious files less prominent or to avoid detection by traditional security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs**: Check Windows Event Logs, particularly Security and System logs to confirm the creation of the service and further analyze its properties.
  - **Analyze Service Installation**: Use EDR tools to examine the behavior of the service. Investigate associated processes, and evaluate if any malicious behavior can be correlated with the service execution.
  - **Check File Path**: Inspect the file paths of newly installed services for suspicious characteristics or known hashes, using tools like AV and file integrity monitoring solutions to identify if the binaries are recognized as malicious.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to monitor for any unusual outbound connections from the service. Validate whether the service is communicating with known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a high severity level because the installation of a service with suspicious folder patterns may indicate an attempt to maintain persistence on a compromised system, which poses significant risks to the enterprise's security posture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may fail to fire if attackers use legitimate folder patterns for service installations or employ methods to obscure the service creation from logging. Additionally, if security event logging is disabled or insufficiently configured, the rule cannot detect suspicious activity effectively. Furthermore, we assume that all file paths relevant to service installations will be captured appropriately, but variations in Windows configurations or custom log policies may also hinder total visibility.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "NetSupport Manager Service Install" is designed to detect the installation of the NetSupport Manager service on Windows systems. This rule triggers when specific events are logged by the Service Control Manager (SCM) indicating the creation of a new service. It targets Event ID 7045, which signifies the installation of a service, checking for particular conditions in the event data. The key indicators include the service name "Client32" and the image path containing "\NetSupport Manager\client32.exe", which is the executable associated with the NetSupport Manager application.
  This detection rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence, specifically the technique T1543 
  - Create or Modify System Process. By monitoring for service installations, particularly ones that may be leveraged by adversaries for maintaining access, the rule assists in identifying potentially malicious activity within the environment. Analysts can utilize this rule to ensure that any installation of this software is scrutinized for legitimacy.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Service Installation:** Check the Service Control Manager logs for Event ID 7045 to confirm the installation details, including the service name and image path.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Use EDR to investigate the user account associated with the service installation, analyzing if it aligns with normal operational behavior.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators:** Review logs from other relevant sources (e.g., Sysmon and Windows Event Logs) to identify any anomalous activities or processes that may have occurred around the same time as the service installation.
  - **Evaluate Network Activity:** Utilize network logs to trace any connections initiated by the NetSupport Manager service to determine if unauthorized data exfiltration or command and control communication may occur.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is categorized as medium due to the legitimate use of the application for remote support. However, its installation can also indicate potential adversary activity or persistence mechanisms, warranting careful scrutiny.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where the service is installed using unconventional methods that bypass standard logging, or if logging settings in the environment do not capture the relevant Event IDs. Additionally, the rule assumes that the presence of the “Client32” service without further context may still be legitimate; thus, responders should cross-reference user behavior and usage patterns. Adversaries may also delete or modify service entries to obfuscate their actions, which may lead to the alert going unnoticed.

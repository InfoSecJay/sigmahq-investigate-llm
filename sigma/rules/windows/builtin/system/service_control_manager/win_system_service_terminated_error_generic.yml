  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Windows Service Terminated With Error" is designed to detect instances where Windows services are unexpectedly terminated with a specific error status, as indicated by Event ID 7023 in the System logs. This event is logged by the Service Control Manager (SCM) and indicates that a service has stopped due to an error condition, which could be the result of various operational issues or potentially malicious activity. The rule aims to highlight abrupt service terminations which may be part of an attackerâ€™s strategy to evade security measures, ensuring the detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion. The primary data source leveraged for this detection is the Windows System log, specifically looking for events related to service terminations recorded by the SCM.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check the System logs for Event ID 7023 for any additional details regarding the service that has terminated, paying close attention to the error message displayed.
  - **Correlate with Recent Changes:** Investigate any recent changes in the environment that may have affected the service in question, such as updates, configuration changes, or security patches.
  - **Examine Related Activities:** Utilize EDR solutions to review the timeline of events leading up to the termination to determine if any abnormal activities occurred, especially involving service invocations or process creations.
  - **Cross-Check With Other Sources:** Look for related network connection logs or AV detections that may indicate external influences or prior malicious actions leading to the service failure.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a low severity level, indicating that while service terminations could be benign and often occur for legitimate reasons, they still warrant investigation to rule out potential malicious intent, especially within a large enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in scenarios where the Service Control Manager fails to log the termination event due to misconfigurations or if logging is disabled. Additionally, services that are terminated without generating the specific Event ID 7023 will evade detection. Analysts should be aware that legitimate administrative actions or system failures could lead to false positives, thereby complicating the interpretation of the logged events.

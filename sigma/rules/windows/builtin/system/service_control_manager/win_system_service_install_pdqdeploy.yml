  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the installation of the PDQDeploy service on a Windows system, which can indicate that the PDQDeploy application has been installed. PDQDeploy is a tool used for deploying software packages to multiple machines and can be misused by malicious actors to remotely install unauthorized software or execute commands, leading to privilege escalation and potential control over target systems. The rule examines Windows event logs produced by the Service Control Manager (SCM), specifically Event ID 7045, which indicates a service installation. The rule looks for entries where the `ImagePath` contains "PDQDeployService.exe" and the `ServiceName` is either "PDQDeploy" or "PDQ Deploy." This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Privilege Escalation" and technique "T1543.003 
  - Create or Modify System Service."
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Service Installation Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs (System) specifically Event ID 7045 to confirm the installation of the PDQDeploy service and inspect other recent service installations for any unusual activity.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Utilize EDR to monitor for additional actions taken by the PDQDeploy service, including any process creation, command executions, or network connections initiated by it after installation.
  - **Examine Network Activity:** Review network logs from the firewall or EDR that show outbound connections from the machine where PDQDeploy was installed to identify any unauthorized communication to external addresses.
  - **Verify Application Context:** Check with the application owner or verify through management tools whether this service installation was authorized and investigate the intent behind its use if it was unexpected.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert priority is set to medium, indicating that while the presence of the PDQDeploy service may signal legitimate administrative activity, it can also represent a significant risk if utilized maliciously. Prompt investigation is warranted to differentiate between safe and potentially harmful use cases.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that service installations are correctly reported and logged in the Windows Event Logs, which could be impacted by log manipulation or misconfigurations. It may not detect versions of PDQDeploy that do not create a service entry or if authorized installations occur without following proper change management processes. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions may trigger false positives, which require context from your organizationâ€™s software deployment practices.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying occurrences where PowerShell scripts are installed as Windows services. It captures specific events recorded by the Service Control Manager, particularly those with Event ID 7045, which indicates that a new service has been created. The rule looks for specific keywords in the `ImagePath`, namely 'powershell' or 'pwsh,' which would suggest that the service is running a PowerShell script. This activity can often be associated with malicious behaviors, such as persistence mechanisms employed by attackers, making it crucial for incident response teams to investigate such alerts promptly. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1569.002, which addresses the execution of scripts via service installations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Event Details:** Check the Service Control Manager logs for Event ID 7045 to find details on the service, including the service name, binary path, and its startup type.
  - **Correlate with Process Execution:** Use EDR tools to correlate the detected service creation with process execution logs to establish whether the PowerShell process was executed as a system service.
  - **Review Service Configuration:** Investigate the service configuration to determine its behavior and the context of its execution. Look for any unusual settings or dependencies.
  - **Check for Related Network Activity:** Utilize network logs from FW or NDR tools to analyze any outbound connections or unusual network activity associated with the service for lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the rule's high severity level, any alert triggered suggests potentially unauthorized or malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence on the system. This could lead to increased risk of further compromise, requiring immediate attention from incident responders to mitigate potential threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses non-standard names for services or obfuscates PowerShell references, making detection more challenging. Additionally, if the attacker routes the PowerShell activity through system scripts or utilizes other scripting languages, the rule will not capture such instances. Further, in environments with strict service creation policies, legitimate service installations may inadvertently trigger false positives, necessitating careful tuning of the detection criteria.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the installation and execution of the RemCom service on Windows systems. It identifies specific events logged by the Service Control Manager (SCM) that indicate the creation of a service named "RemComSvc" with a corresponding image path ending in "\RemComSvc.exe." The detection is based on Windows Event ID 7045, which records the addition of a new service to the system. By monitoring service-related events, this rule leverages the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1569.002 (Service Execution), as adversaries may use this method to establish persistence and facilitate remote access through the RemCom tool.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Search for Event ID 7045 in the Windows Security logs to see if there are records of the "RemComSvc" service being created. Look for the timestamp to correlate with other events during that period.
    
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Using EDR, inspect the process tree for any instances of "RemComSvc.exe" to ascertain if it is currently running or has executed recently. Note any unusual parent-child relationships in the process hierarchy.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Investigate network logs for any outbound connections initiated by "RemComSvc.exe" or other suspicious processes. Check the destinations to determine if legitimate communications to known RemCom management hosts are being made.
  - **Inspect System Integrity:** Validate the integrity of the system configuration by reviewing system and application logs for anomalies or unauthorized changes that correlate with the installation of the RemCom service. Additionally, confirm that baseline security configurations remain intact.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this rule is categorized as medium severity, as the creation of a remote access service like RemCom can be indicative of potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation to mitigate risks to enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses a different service name or binary path for RemCom, or if system logging for Event ID 7045 is disabled. Furthermore, false positives might arise if legitimate applications or administrative tasks install or utilize the RemCom service. It is assumed that all relevant event logging is properly configured and that attackers do not tamper with or delete service logs.

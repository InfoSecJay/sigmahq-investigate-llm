  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the installation of the TacticalRMM service on Windows systems. TacticalRMM is a remote monitoring and management tool that can be abused for malicious purposes, including unauthorized access and control over compromised systems. The rule captures specific Windows System Event Logs, particularly looking for Event ID 7045, which indicates a service was installed. In addition to the event's provider name, the rule evaluates the attributes of the newly created service, such as the `ImagePath` containing 'tacticalrmm.exe' and the `ServiceName` including 'TacticalRMM Agent Service'. The rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic 'Command and Control' (TA0011) and the Technique 'Remote Access Tools' (T1219).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Check Windows System Event Logs for Event ID 7045 to confirm the service installation date, user account used, and any other pertinent details surrounding the event.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to track the execution history of `tacticalrmm.exe`, including command-line parameters and parent-child process relationships to identify any suspicious activity.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Analyze network metadata to look for any outbound connections associated with the TacticalRMM service that could indicate command-and-control communications.
  - **Identify Legitimate Usage:** Cross-reference the identified service installation with organizational documentation or records to determine if the installation was authorized or part of routine administrative activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for misuse associated with tools like TacticalRMM, the severity level of medium is assigned to this alert. Organizations must quickly assess the legitimacy of the installation due to the possible risk of unauthorized remote access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the TacticalRMM service is installed through non-standard methods or if the service has been renamed or disguised to evade detection. Additionally, it assumes that the Windows Event Logs are being collected adequately and that there is no tampering with logs that would prevent accurate event capture. Adversaries may attempt to install the service using a different executable name or utilize existing legitimate services to avoid detection.

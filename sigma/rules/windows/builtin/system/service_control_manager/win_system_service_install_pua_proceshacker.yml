  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the use of the ProcessHacker tool, which is often leveraged by adversaries for privilege escalation on Windows systems. The detection is triggered by events logged by the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), specifically looking for Event ID 7045, which indicates the installation of a new service. For this rule, it focuses on services that start with "ProcessHacker" and are associated with the 'LocalSystem' account, revealing the potential for gaining elevated privileges. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with this detection are T1543.003 (Create or Modify System Service) and T1569.002 (Service Execution), highlighting malicious behaviors that occur within the execution and privilege escalation tactics.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Examine the Windows Event Logs, particularly the System logs, for Entry ID 7045 to validate the creation of a service associated with ProcessHacker.
  - **Analyze Service Configuration:** Use Windows command line tools or PowerShell to investigate attributes of the newly created ProcessHacker service, looking for unusual startup types or account configurations.
  - **Cross-Reference EDR Alerts:** Check your EDR system for any alerts related to the ProcessHacker executable, focusing on process creation and network activity to spot malicious patterns.
  - **Evaluate User Activity:** Investigate the user or account activity leading up to the service installation to determine if this behavior is consistent with normal operations or indicative of malintent.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert's high severity level is justified due to the potential security implications of an unauthorized privilege escalation tool being deployed within an enterprise environment, which could lead to further exploitation or data breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the ProcessHacker service is executed under a different name or account, thus evading detection. Additionally, legitimate applications or administrative tasks might create similar service events. Engineers should be aware that adversaries may employ additional obfuscation techniques or established benign services to bypass this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the installation events of the AnyDesk remote access software service on Windows systems. Specifically, it monitors for Event ID 7045 from the Service Control Manager, which signifies the addition of a new service. The rule looks for service names containing 'AnyDesk' and an image path that includes 'AnyDesk', indicating that the software has been set up on the system. Given that AnyDesk is often used for remote desktop control, its unauthorized installation could lead to potential abuse, particularly if it is not a sanctioned tool within the enterprise environment. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Persistence" under technique T1050, which encompasses the creation of services to maintain access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Service Installation:** Review the Service Control Manager logs for Event ID 7045 to confirm the installation of AnyDesk and analyze the service parameters and configurations at the time of the event.
  - **Check User Context:** Investigate user account activity around the time of the service installation using Windows Security logs to identify who installed the service and if this user has a legitimate reason for it.
  - **Assess System Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to monitor for anomalous behavior associated with AnyDesk, such as unexpected network connections or process spawning linked to the AnyDesk executable.
  - **Examine Compliance and Policies:** Cross-reference the installation with organizational policy and compliance documentation to determine if AnyDesk is an approved application for use within the enterprise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential security risks associated with the unauthorized installation and usage of AnyDesk, which could facilitate unauthorized remote access and hinder incident response efforts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire in certain scenarios, such as when the software is installed without using standard Windows Service installation methods or when the installation occurs through a different channel that does not generate Event ID 7045. Additionally, legitimate installations of AnyDesk by authorized personnel may be overlooked as false positives. Attackers might also utilize techniques to disguise the service name or image path to evade detection, thereby bypassing this rule.

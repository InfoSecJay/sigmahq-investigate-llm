  ### Technical Context
  The "CSExec Service Installation" detection rule is designed to identify instances where the CSExec service is being installed and executed on Windows systems. This rule specifically looks for Event ID 7045 from the Service Control Manager, which indicates a new service installation event, coupled with specific attributes that identify the service as 'csexecsvc' and its executable path ending with 'csexecsvc.exe'. The detection captures activities aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1569.002 (Service Execution), as adversaries may employ CSExec to execute malicious commands or scripts remotely. The primary data sources leveraged for this detection include Windows System event logs, which provide visibility into service management actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the event logs:** Review the Windows System event logs for Event ID 7045 to confirm the installation details and context of the CSExec service.
  - **Correlate with process execution:** Utilize EDR tools to trace processes that interacted with the CSExec service over time to ascertain any suspicious command-line parameters or execution patterns.
  - **Analyze network activity:** Examine network connection logs to identify any outbound communications from the CSExec service that may indicate exploitation or command-and-control activity.
  - **Review user accounts:** Investigate user accounts associated with the installation of the CSExec service to determine if any unauthorized or unusual logins have occurred at the time of the service installation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level because while the installation of the CSExec service can be a legitimate administrative tool, its presence can indicate potential misuse or lateral movement by threat actors, warranting further investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  It is important to note that the rule may not trigger in environments where the CSExec service is legitimately utilized for administrative purposes without any malicious intent. Additionally, if an adversary employs obfuscation techniques or utilizes a different service name, this rule may fail to capture the event accurately. Engineers must consider legitimate applications of CSExec and ensure they incorporate contextual analysis in their investigations.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect the installation of malicious services associated with Cobalt Strike beacons, which are commonly used for privilege escalation or lateral movement by attackers within a network. The rule specifically monitors Windows System logs for Service Control Manager (SCM) events, particularly Event ID 7045, which indicates the creation of a new service. The detection looks for various indicators in the `ImagePath` of newly created services: it flags entries containing suspicious patterns that suggest the use of administrative shares (like 'ADMIN$'), PowerShell commands with encoded parameters, or URLs indicating potential malicious downloads. The rule leverages the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution and Privilege Escalation, particularly techniques T1021.002 (Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares) and T1569.002 (Service Execution), allowing analysts to focus investigations on theoretically compromised hosts where Cobalt Strike may be active.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Examine Windows Security and System event logs for Event ID 7045; cross-reference the service names and ImagePaths associated with newly installed services.
  - **Analyze Process Behavior:** Utilize EDR tools to track any suspicious process behavior related to the identified services. Look for processes invoking PowerShell or accessing external URLs.
  - **Check User Context:** Investigate the user accounts that created the services; validate whether the accounts are authorized and the context in which they were used.
  - **Network Traffic Review:** Inspect the network traffic logs to identify any connections made to suspicious hosts or URLs, particularly those identified in the `ImagePath` of new services.
  ### Prioritization
  When this alert is triggered, it indicates a critical severity level, as it suggests potential exploitation through Cobalt Strike, which often means adversaries are attempting to establish persistence or escalate their access within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary uses covert techniques to install services non-maliciously or if they manipulate legitimate processes or service names to avoid detection. False negatives can occur if the attacker has a valid administrator account to create services under a low-profile name, as well as scenarios involving the use of encryption or obfuscation that may prevent the identification of malicious commands in the ImagePath. It is assumed that environments may have custom applications or services that could trigger false positives, necessitating fine-tuning of the detection parameters.

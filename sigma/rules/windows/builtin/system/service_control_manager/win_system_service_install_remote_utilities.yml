  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Remote Utilities Host Service Install" is designed to detect the installation of the Remote Utilities Host service on Windows systems by monitoring the Service Control Manager (SCM) logs. Specifically, this rule looks for Event ID 7045, which indicates that a new service has been created. The detection logic inspects the service name, which should match "Remote Utilities 
  - Host," and the service executable path must include "rutserv.exe" with the "-service" flag. By analyzing this specific event, the rule aims to identify potential unauthorized persistence mechanisms employed by threat actors, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of persistence (T1543).
  The primary data source for this rule is Windows Security event logs, where it captures critical information related to service installation events. It focuses on attributes such as the service name, executable path, and associated account name to distinguish between legitimate and potentially malicious activity. By leveraging this telemetry, the SOC can strengthen its defenses against threats that attempt to maintain presence through service manipulation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Event Log:** Check Windows Security logs for Event ID 7045 entries corresponding to the "Remote Utilities 
  - Host" service. This log entry provides details about the service installation, including the time of installation and the account used.
  - **Verify the Service Executable:** Cross-reference the execution path of "rutserv.exe" with known good software repositories. Ensure that the executable is legitimate and not a renamed or malicious variant.
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze any outbound connections made by the Remote Utilities service. Check for suspicious connections to external IP addresses that may indicate remote control activity.
  - **Check Installed Services:** Use system management tools to list services currently running on the host. Look for other potentially malicious services that may be installed alongside or in relation to the "Remote Utilities 
  - Host."
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized access and remote control granted by the installation of Remote Utilities. While the tool has legitimate uses, its detection signifies a need for immediate investigation to rule out malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where the Remote Utilities tool is used legitimately and thus configured to be whitelisted or ignored by monitoring systems. Additionally, if adversaries utilize a different name for the service or modify the command line parameters, the detection may fail. It assumes that the Windows Security event logging is enabled and functioning correctly; in cases where logs are not retained, the rule will not be effective. Other factors include system misconfiguration that could lead to undetected service modifications.

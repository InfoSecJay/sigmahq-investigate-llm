  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect obfuscated PowerShell commands executed through the Windows RUNDLL launcher. Specifically, it identifies instances where the Windows Service Control Manager logs an event (Event ID 7045) indicative of a new service being installed with an ImagePath that includes suspicious references such as `rundll32.exe`, `shell32.dll`, or PowerShell itself. These patterns are relevant as attackers often leverage RUNDLL to execute malicious or obfuscated PowerShell commands, making detection critical for security. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, specifically focusing on "Defense Evasion" (T1027) and "Execution" (T1059.001), both of which are strategies employed by adversaries to carry out their malicious activities without being detected.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Service Control Manager Events:** Check the Windows Event Logs for Event ID 7045, focusing on the Provider_Name field to find related entries that could indicate suspicious service activity.
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to analyze process creation logs for any instances of `rundll32.exe` being invoked with PowerShell commands, focusing on the command-line arguments passed during execution.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Investigate any corresponding outbound network connections made by the service in question using NDR and firewall logs to confirm if there were any data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Check for Anomalous Behavior:** Look for additional anomalies in the environment, such as unusual user accounts or other baseline deviations that could indicate a broader compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity as the use of RUNDLL to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands may indicate an advanced persistent threat or malware activity, necessitating timely investigation to mitigate potential security risks within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses non-standard names for their scripts or if they run PowerShell in an unmonitored context. There is an assumption that `rundll32.exe` will consistently be used in this manner; thus, variations in execution tactics may go undetected. Additionally, environments configured to suppress certain logs or configured with out-of-date auditing may not provide complete visibility needed for detection.

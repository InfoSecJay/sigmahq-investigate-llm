  ### Technical Context
  The "Tap Driver Installation" detection rule targets the installation of the TAP driver, a component commonly associated with OpenVPN software, which is often leveraged by attackers for data exfiltration through tunneling techniques. The rule specifically looks for Windows Event ID 7045, which indicates that a new service has been installed, in conjunction with monitoring for service control events originating from the Service Control Manager (SCM). By checking the `Provider_Name` for 'Service Control Manager' and filtering for `ImagePath` that contains 'tap0901', this rule seeks to identify potential malicious activities that could enable unauthorized data transmission. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of Exfiltration (T1048), which emphasizes methods used for data exfiltration over alternative protocols.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Driver Installation**: Use Windows Event Logs to retrieve Event ID 7045 entries and check for recent installations of the TAP driver. Validate the context of installation by examining the associated user account and timestamps.
  - **Cross-check Network Activity**: Utilize EDR solutions to analyze network behavior of the system where the TAP driver was installed. Look for anomalous outbound traffic patterns or connections that may indicate data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Review User and Process Behavior**: Investigate the user who executed the installation and any associated processes using Sysmon logs. Check for unusual PowerShell commands or process creation events that may correlate with suspicious activity.
  - **Examine Endpoint Security Data**: Query AV and NDR logs to assess any alerts or detections that may have occurred in conjunction with the TAP driver installation, and determine if any known malicious behavior was flagged.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as medium because the installation of the TAP driver could indicate potential preparatory steps for data exfiltration; however, it could also represent legitimate behavior for users who need VPN capabilities for secure access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where the TAP driver is installed without generating an Event ID 7045, for instance, if installation occurs silently or is skipped entirely. Additionally, the presence of legitimate OpenVPN installations can create false positives, necessitating a context-aware investigation. Furthermore, attackers may employ alternative drivers or methods of exfiltration that do not involve the TAP driver, which this rule would not detect. Effectively, the reliability of this rule hinges on the accurate logging and monitoring of system events.

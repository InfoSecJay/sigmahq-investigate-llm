  Detects PDQDeploy service installation on the target system.
  When a package is deployed via PDQDeploy it installs a remote service on the target machine with the name "PDQDeployRunner-X" where "X" is an integer starting from 1

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the installation of the PDQDeploy service on Windows systems, specifically focusing on the creation of a service with the name pattern "PDQDeployRunner-X," where "X" is a sequential integer starting from 1. The rule leverages Windows Event Log entries from the Service Control Manager (Service creation events with Event ID 7045) to detect when a new service is added. It looks for specific attributes within those events to confirm that the service being installed matches the expected naming convention associated with PDQDeploy deployments. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Privilege Escalation (Technique T1543.003: Create or Modify System Service) since attackers often create or modify services to maintain persistence and increase their privileges.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Service Installation Events:** Examine the Windows Event Logs for Event ID 7045. Look for the specific service name "PDQDeployRunner-X" to confirm the installation and gather details related to the timestamp, user context, and previous system state.
    
  - **Correlate with Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to track process creation logs that coincide with the service installation event. Check the command-line parameters and parent processes to understand the context and the legitimacy of the deployment.
    
  - **Check for Anomalous Activity:** Utilize threat intelligence gathered through EDR, AV, and network detection to evaluate if there's any malicious activity related to the IP addresses or domains accessed during the service installation times.
    
  - **Validate Legitimate Usage:** Cross-reference with internal lists of approved tool usage to confirm whether the PDQDeploy service should be installed. Consult with the relevant team if this action was scheduled or authorized.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to its potential association with unauthorized privilege escalation activities, which could enable attackers to install malicious services and maintain persistence within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in situations where the PDQDeploy service is installed using different naming conventions or methods that do not trigger Event ID 7045, such as manual installations directly from a PowerShell command without service creation events. Additionally, this rule assumes that the organization actively monitors service installations; if logging is not properly configured, the detection may fail. It is also important to recognize that legitimate use of PDQDeploy is a false positive, potentially leading to unnecessary investigations.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of well-known credential dumping tools via the Windows Service Control Manager, focusing specifically on events logged with Event ID 7045. When a service is created, the information is captured, including the Provider Name and ImagePath, which specifies the executable that's being run. This rule looks for strings commonly associated with credential dumping tools, such as ‘cachedump’, ‘pwdump’, and ‘mimidrv’, among others. Recognizing these tools' execution is crucial for immediate threat detection since they allow attackers to extract sensitive authentication data from compromised systems. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Credential Access (T1003), indicating potential unauthorized access or exploitation attempts on user credentials.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the relevant Windows Security logs focusing on Event ID 7045 to corroborate the service creation with an unusual ImagePath. Look for any unauthorized service installations in the logs alongside the event time.
  - **Utilize EDR Solutions:** Query your EDR tool for the process tree and activity around the time of the alert, specifically looking for parent processes that spawned the alerting service and any correlated suspicious behavior.
  - **Network Analysis:** Analyze network logs, particularly focusing on recent outbound traffic that could indicate data exfiltration attempts related to the credential dumping tools. Look for connections to unusual external IP addresses or file exfiltration patterns.
  - **Malware Scanning:** Run a scan using your Antivirus solution if the rule alerts on a potentially malicious service. Ensure to perform further analysis on the executable paths indicated in the event logs.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that credential dumping activity poses a high risk to enterprise security, any alert stemming from this rule should be considered critical. Credential harvesting can lead to significant compromises, including unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the credential dumping tool is executed without utilizing the service manager or if the tools are modified to use less common naming conventions, thus evading detection. Assumptions include the continued use of standard service installation practices by adversaries, which may not always hold true. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions can trigger false positives, thus necessitating a thorough investigation to distinguish between benign and malicious activity.

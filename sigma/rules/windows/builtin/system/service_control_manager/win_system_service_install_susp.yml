  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Service Installation" rule is designed to detect potentially malicious behavior involving the installation of Windows services. It targets Event ID 7045 from the Service Control Manager, which logs service creation events in Windows. This rule specifically looks for unusual command-line parameters or file paths that may indicate an attempt to install a service in a covert manner. The conditions checked for include the use of PowerShell commands, manipulation within temporary directories, usage of hidden windows, and other suspicious patterns—which could signal an adversary’s attempt to maintain persistence in the environment. The detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of **Persistence** and **Privilege Escalation** (specifically technique T1543.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the Event Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs (System log) for Event ID 7045 corresponding to the suspicious installation. Cross-reference timestamps to correlate with any other unusual activity during that period.
    
  - **Analyze Process Activity:** Use EDR tools to analyze process creation associated with the service installation to determine if any related process spawns are suspicious or unauthorized.
  - **Inspect Service Properties:** Investigate the properties of the newly created service, including the binary path and startup type, to assess any potential security risks posed by the service.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize network monitoring tools to track any unusual outbound connections initiated by the service. This helps in identifying any possible exfiltration or command and control communication related to the service.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential impact of unauthorized service installations on system integrity and security. Services installed by malicious actors can facilitate persistence and elevate privileges, creating significant risk within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule may be limited if adversaries leverage legitimate administrative tools, use obfuscated scripts, or employ bypass techniques that do not trigger Event ID 7045. Additionally, some legitimate service installations could also match the detection criteria, which necessitates thorough investigation of false positives. It's also assumed that auditing for Event ID 7045 is enabled on monitored systems; otherwise, the rule may not fire.

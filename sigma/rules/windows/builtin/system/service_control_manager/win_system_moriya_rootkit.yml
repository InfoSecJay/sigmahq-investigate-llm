  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential malicious activity associated with the Moriya rootkit, specifically through the creation of a suspicious Windows service known as "ZzNetSvc." The rule leverages Windows System event logs, particularly looking for Event ID 7045, which indicates a new service creation by the Service Control Manager. By monitoring this specific event, the rule aims to detect unauthorized persistence mechanismsâ€”an integral part of the Moriya rootkit's operation. The tactic associated with this detection falls under MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Persistence" and technique "Create or Modify System Service" (T1543.003). The underlying assumption is that malicious services often present distinct naming patterns or unusual provider names, which are flagged for investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Service Details:** Check the properties of the ZzNetSvc service in the Windows Services management console or via command-line tools. Look for unusual configurations, dependencies, or executable paths that do not align with legitimate software.
    
  - **Conduct a List of Running Services:** Utilize the EDR solution to list active services on the host system. Identify any other suspicious services that may indicate further compromise.
  - **Review System Logs:** Examine historical logs around the time Event ID 7045 was generated to check for related suspicious activities, including process creation logs and network connections that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Analyze Inbound and Outbound Connections:** Use network detection tools to analyze any unusual or malicious external connections associated with the compromised service. Cross-reference with threat intelligence feeds to identify known bad IPs or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as critical due to its potential indication of a significant compromise involving rootkit functionalities that allow persistent unauthorized access. The existence of a malware service can lead to further exploitation and lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses stealthy techniques that evade traditional logging practices, such as modifying existing benign services instead of creating new ones or using legitimate service names. Additionally, organizations may have a varied service landscape, which might cause false positives or misses in detection if benign services appear similar to ZzNetSvc. It is also assumed that relevant logging levels are enabled on all systems where detection is expected; otherwise, crucial service creation events might not be logged at all.

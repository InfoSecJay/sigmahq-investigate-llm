  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the installation or execution of suspicious services on Windows systems, which can be indicative of potentially malicious activity. It leverages the Windows Event Log from the Service Control Manager (SCM), specifically monitoring for Event IDs 7045 (indicating a service was created) and 7036 (indicating a service's state has changed). The rule focuses on identifying service names known for their association with credential dumping or privilege escalation, such as 'cachedump', 'DumpSvc', and 'UACBypassedService'. Additionally, it searches for service images with file paths that include the word 'bypass', a common tactic used by adversaries to evade detection. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1569.002 (Service Execution), where attackers exploit service creation or modification for persistence or privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the Windows Event Logs for Event IDs 7045 and 7036 to gather contextual information about the created or altered services.
  - **Analyze Service Configurations:** Use Sysinternals tools or Windows Service management commands (e.g., `sc query`) to inspect the configuration and status of the detected suspicious services.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate related process creation events (e.g., using Sysmon or EDR) to determine if any unauthorized processes were initiated in conjunction with the suspicious services.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Check network logs (from EDR or firewall) to identify any unusual outbound connections that may occur as a result of the suspicious service execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for significant risk, as the creation or manipulation of services can allow attackers to maintain persistence and elevate privileges within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the suspect service is quickly removed after execution, or if the suspicious activities are masked or executed with legitimate service names not captured in the ruleâ€™s criteria. It assumes that the service creation events will not be missed by log retention policies, which may lead to gaps in monitoring. Additionally, adversaries may use techniques to anonymize their service names or utilize services that do not trigger this specific detection, thus bypassing the rule.

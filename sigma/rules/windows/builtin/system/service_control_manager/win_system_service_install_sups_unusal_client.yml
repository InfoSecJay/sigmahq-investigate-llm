  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the installation of a Windows service initiated by an unusual client, specifically when the clientâ€™s process ID (PID) is 0 or its parent process also has a PID of 0. In Windows operating systems, services are typically managed through the Service Control Manager (SCM), which is responsible for starting, stopping, and managing services. The role of the service installer is crucial in ensuring that authorized services are running; hence, a service installed by a process with a PID of 0 is highly suspicious and typically indicates either malicious activity or a potential misconfiguration. This rule leverages telemetry from the Windows System logs, specifically monitoring for EventID 7045, which records the installation of a new service. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1543, which deals with the creation or modification of system services for persistence and privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query Event Logs:** Search the Windows System event logs for EventID 7045 to locate the specific occurrences of services installed by clients with PID 0. Note the timestamp and the name of the installed service.
  - **Analyze Process Tree:** Use EDR solutions to analyze the process tree at the time of the alert to investigate which processes may have been running and any that may have led to the unusual client behavior.
  - **Review Service Details:** Inspect the configuration and settings of the newly installed service for indicators of compromise, including the command line parameters or any unusual executable paths.
  - **Check for Historical Context:** Review any historical changes made to the service since its installation and determine if this service behavior deviates from the organization's baseline security posture.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is given a high severity level due to the nature of the suspicious behavior involving service installation by abnormal processes, which could indicate a potential vector for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms employed by an attacker.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger for legitimate services that could also be installed by system-controlled processes or during system updates where services are routinely modified. Furthermore, if an attacker employs a method that does not utilize the standard Windows Service Control Manager to install illicit services, this detection may fail to activate. Engineers should also consider that administrative user actions and certain trusted applications could lead to false positives when manipulating services.

  ### Technical Context
  The WMI Persistence detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious persistence mechanisms leveraging the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) framework. This rule focuses on tracking suspicious activities related to WMI event filters and command line event consumers. Specifically, it examines EventID 5861, which indicates a binding between WMI filters and consumers â€” particularly those that could enable malicious scripts or commands to run persistently. It also observes EventID 5859, which marks the registration of WMI filters. The rule excludes legitimate filters created by the System Event Manager (SCM) for security event logging to minimize false positives. Key technical data sources for this rule include WMI logs and Windows security logs; thus, analysts should ensure WMI Namespaces Auditing and SACL are configured correctly in their environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Use the EDR tool to track and analyze the activity of processes associated with the detected WMI events, checking for unexpected script or executable behavior.
  - Review Windows Security logs to identify the specific user and time of the event creation and assess if the user account has legitimate permissions.
  - Query WMI namespaces and the configuration of event consumers on affected machines to determine the legitimacy of the active consumers involved.
  - Examine network logs and traffic using the NGFW and Proxy tools for any outbound connections initiated by the identified processes, looking for indicators of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.

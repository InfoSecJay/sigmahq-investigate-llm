  ### Technical Context
  The "Microsoft Defender Tamper Protection Trigger" rule is designed to detect unauthorized attempts to modify critical settings within Microsoft Defender Antivirus, specifically targeting the "Real Time Monitoring" and "Behavior Monitoring" features. The rule relies on monitoring Windows Event ID 5013, which is generated when Tamper Protection, a security feature of Microsoft Defender, blocks an attempt to change its configuration. The detection criteria include specific registry paths that correspond to settings related to disabling various Defender functions, such as antivirus capabilities and scanning options. By capturing these blocked actions, the rule underscores attempts at evading security controls, thus aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001).
  The primary data source for this detection is Windows Defender's logs, specifically the entries associated with its service. When a modification attempt is blocked, Event ID 5013 is logged, providing critical information about the attempted change and highlighting active threats or misconfigurations within the environment. This information is crucial for incident responders to ensure that no malicious actors are circumventing established security measures. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Check the Security logs for Event ID 5013 to see which attempts were blocked and the specific settings that were targeted.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Logs:** Use EDR tools to correlate the blocked events with any active processes or users at the time of the violations to determine if there are any suspicious activities occurring concurrently.
  - **Inspect User Activity:** Investigate the user accounts that triggered the blocked events to ascertain whether they are legitimate admin accounts or potentially compromised user accounts exhibiting unusual behavior.
  - **Validate Tamper Protection Settings:** Ensure that Tamper Protection is appropriately configured and enabled within Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings to prevent effective manipulation of security measures.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity, as blocked tampering attempts indicate a potential security breach or an attempt to disable critical defense mechanisms within the environment, which could pave the way for other malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if Tamper Protection is not enabled within Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It assumes that all modifications tracked through Event ID 5013 indicate potential threats; however, legitimate administrative actions, such as during system updates or testing, might generate similar logs. Furthermore, if an adversary employs tactics such as credential theft or exploits vulnerabilities in the Defender service, they may bypass detection entirely, leading to gaps in monitoring capabilities.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the disabling of Windows Defender's malware and potentially unwanted application (PUA) scanning capabilities. Specifically, it monitors for Event ID 5010, which indicates that the scanning feature has been turned off. The event data provides insight into potential defense evasion tactics employed by threat actors aiming to compromise systems by circumventing antivirus protections. The primary technical data source utilized in this rule is Windows event logs, specifically those generated by the Windows Defender service. When this rule triggers, it suggests that an adversary may be attempting to create an environment conducive to malware installation or other unapproved software.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Utilize the EDR to review the activity logs around the time of the event to identify what process or user action led to the disabling of the Defender scanning feature.
  - Check recent changes in system configurations using configuration management tools or logs to determine if system policies were modified inappropriately.
  - Analyze network logs (NDR/NGFW) to identify any suspicious outbound connections or unusual command-and-control activity that may correlate with the timeframe of the alert.
  - Review user access logs in the SIEM to ascertain if any suspicious user accounts executed commands that could manipulate security settings related to Windows Defender.

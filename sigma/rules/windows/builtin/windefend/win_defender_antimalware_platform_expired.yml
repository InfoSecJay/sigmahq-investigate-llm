  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying when the grace period for Windows Defender has expired, which indicates that the protection mechanisms for detecting and mitigating threats such as viruses and spyware are disabled. The rule specifically monitors for Event ID 5101, an event logged by Windows Defender indicating that the antivirus service is no longer valid. By analyzing this event, security teams can promptly respond to potential vulnerabilities in their network, as this condition signifies that the endpoint may be exposed to malware and other malicious entities without protection.
  The primary data source for this detection is the Windows event log generated by the Windows Defender service. To maintain robust security controls, it is important for incident responders to regularly review these logs to ensure the antivirus protections remain operational and to investigate any abnormalities that could lead to potential compromises.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the endpoint's event logs to confirm the occurrence of Event ID 5101, which indicates the expiration of Windows Defender's grace period.
  - Utilize EDR tools to scan the affected system for any signs of compromise or malware that could exploit the lack of antivirus protection.
  - Check for recent changes to the configuration of Windows Defender or any unapproved software installations that may have led to the expiration of the grace period.
  - Consult network logs and traffic monitoring tools (like NDR and Proxy) to identify any suspicious activities or communications that may have taken place following the expiration event.

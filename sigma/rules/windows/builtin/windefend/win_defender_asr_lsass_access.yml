  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies attempts to access the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, which is a critical component of Windows responsible for enforcing security policies and managing user credentials. The rule specifically looks for Event ID 1121, which indicates that a process has accessed lsass.exe. To minimize false positives, the rule employs several filters to eliminate benign processes that typically access LSASS, including common system applications and processes like Microsoft Installer or Windows task manager. The detection leverages telemetry from Windows Defender, focusing on processes that might signal credential access attempts, thus aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Credential Access" and technique "T1003.001: Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory."
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR alerts:** Examine endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for details regarding the flagged process accessing LSASS. Look for additional context such as parent process and user account details.
    
  - **Correlate with Windows Security Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs to find any accompanying authorization failures or unusual access patterns related to the user accounts in question when the LSASS access event was triggered.
    
  - **Examine Process Behavior:** Analyze the behavior of the processes listed in the alert—particularly any that are part of the specified 'not' filter—to rule out benign activity or to investigate suspicious ones further.
    
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Utilize your network detection and response (NDR) tools to monitor any anomalous outbound connections from the identified processes, looking for connections to suspicious domains or IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  The high-severity level of this alert is justified as unauthorized access to LSASS can lead to credential theft, which is a precursor to more extensive breaches within the enterprise. Rapid response is essential to mitigate potential compromise.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attack occurs from a legitimate process, which might evade detection if not included in the defined filters. Additionally, it assumes that standard Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) policies are enabled on the system. If these policies are not in place, attackers may bypass detection. The rule might also miss sophisticated attacks that utilize trusted system processes or when the malicious activity mimics legitimate processes.

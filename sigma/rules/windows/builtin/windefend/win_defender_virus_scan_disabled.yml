  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Windows Defender Virus Scanning Feature Disabled" is designed to detect instances where the Windows Defender antivirus scanning capability has been disabled within a Windows environment. This detection is achieved by monitoring Windows Event Logs, specifically looking for Event ID 5012, which indicates that the virus scanning feature has been turned off. The disabling of antivirus software is a common tactic employed by adversaries to evade detection and increase the chances of successful malware execution and other malicious activities.
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of **Defense Evasion** (T1562.001). By disabling critical security features such as antivirus, attackers can facilitate broader exploitation of vulnerabilities and minimize their chances of early detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs:** Review the Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 5012 to confirm that the Windows Defender scanning feature has indeed been disabled and to identify the user or process responsible for this action.
  - **Correlate with Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze process creation logs around the time of the event to see if any suspicious processes were initiated that could correlate with the disabling of Windows Defender.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Use network detection tools (NDR) to monitor for unusual outbound connections from the affected host, which may indicate data exfiltration or communication with malicious command and control (C2) servers.
  - **Review Endpoint Protection Status:** Confirm the current status of Windows Defender and any other endpoint protection tools on the affected system to ensure that security remains intact and assess the need for reinstating protective measures.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because the disabling of an antivirus solution significantly increases the risk of malware infection and other malicious activities, requiring urgent investigation and response to prevent potential compromises.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in scenarios where Event ID 5012 is not generated due to misconfiguration of Windows Defender or logging policies, or when attackers employ alternate methods to disable antivirus functionality that do not trigger this event. Additionally, this detection assumes that the environment has Windows Defender configured properly and that logs are being generated and shipped to the SIEM without any issues, which may not always be the case.

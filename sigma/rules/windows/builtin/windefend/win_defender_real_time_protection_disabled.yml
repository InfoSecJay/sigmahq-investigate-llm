  Detects disabling of Windows Defender Real-time Protection. As this event doesn't contain a lot of information on who initiated this action you might want to reduce it to a "medium" level if this occurs too many times in your environment

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect instances when Windows Defender Real-time Protection is disabled, which can be a potential indicator of malicious activity or attempts to evade detection measures. The rule utilizes event logs from the Windows Defender service, specifically looking for Event ID 5001, which is triggered when the real-time protection feature is turned off. Disabling this feature could create vulnerabilities within the system, allowing malware to operate without detection and potentially leading to a compromise of sensitive data. This alert relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001), highlighting the importance of maintaining security tools operational to protect against threats.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Timeline:** Review the Windows Security event log around the time of the alert to identify any preceding activity leading up to the disabling of real-time protection, including potential unauthorized user actions.
  - **Evaluate User Account Activity:** Investigate the accounts that were active during the timeframe of the event to assess whether legitimate administrative actions were taken, or if unauthorized access might have occurred.
  - **Analyze Endpoint Protection Status:** Use EDR tools to examine the current status of Windows Defender on the affected endpoints, including any other relevant settings that may impact overall security posture.
  - **Review Related Security Alerts:** Correlate this event with other security alerts to determine if there are additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) or related incidents that suggest a broader attack or security concern.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity in an enterprise environment due to the implications of disabling real-time protection, which can open pathways for attackers to exploit the system without being detected. Immediate investigation is important to ascertain whether it was a legitimate action taken by an administrator or could indicate malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the event log for Windows Defender will capture the disabling action accurately; however, it may not fire if defenders are disabled through techniques that do not trigger Event ID 5001. Additionally, the rule does not differentiate between legitimate administrative actions and potential malicious activities, which may lead to false positives in environments where administrators frequently manage Defender settings. It is important for detection engineers to consider that sophisticated attackers might instead use alternative methods to disable protection that do not generate this specific log event.

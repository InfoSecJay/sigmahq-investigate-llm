  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "MSSQL SPProcoption Set" identifies changes to stored procedures in Microsoft SQL Server, specifically when the `sp_procoption` is set or cleared for automatic execution. This action is significant because it enables a stored procedure to run automatically each time the SQL Server instance is started, which can be leveraged as a persistence mechanism by threat actors. The rule monitors event logs from MSSQL and looks for events with EventID 33205, filtering for specific data that indicates the use of the `sp_procoption` command. This requires that the MSSQL audit policy be properly configured to capture such events, ensuring that activity around critical database functions is logged and available for analysis.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs:** Review endpoint detection logs for suspicious behavior on the SQL Server host, including any anomalies in process execution or unexpected administrative actions.
  - **Analyze MSSQL Audit Logs:** Examine the MSSQL audit logs for EventID 33205 to retrieve the timestamps and user accounts involved in the execution of the `sp_procoption` command.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Tools:** Use SIEM or NDR data to correlate the detected event with potential lateral movement or reconnaissance activities that may indicate a broader attack.
  - **Assess User Access Logs:** Investigate user account activity in the database to confirm whether the accounts involved have legitimate administrative privileges or show signs of misuse.

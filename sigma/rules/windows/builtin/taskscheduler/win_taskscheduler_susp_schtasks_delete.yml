  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activities where an adversary attempts to disrupt key system services or processes by deleting their corresponding scheduled tasks. The focus is primarily on critical scheduled tasks associated with system restoration, security (Windows Defender), encryption (BitLocker), and updating mechanisms (Windows Update). The rule leverages Windows event logs, specifically Event ID 141 from the Task Scheduler operational log. 
  To trigger this alert, the rule checks for deletions of tasks that match specific names and ignores actions performed by certain user accounts that are often indicative of legitimate administrative activities. By monitoring these events, SOC analysts and incident responders can identify possible indicators of an attack intending to compromise system integrity, linked to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1489 (Data Encrypted for Impact), which could lead to data destruction or loss.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Event Logs:** Examine the Task Scheduler operational logs for Event ID 141 to identify specific instances of scheduled tasks being deleted, paying particular attention to the timestamp and user context to assess the legitimacy of the activity.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Check the related user accounts for any prior suspicious activities using EDR and investigate their recent actions, especially focusing on other scheduled task modifications or attempts to access sensitive data.
  - **Cross-Reference System Logs:** Use Windows Security or Application event logs to correlate the event with other security incidents or unusual behavior in the vicinity of the same timestamp.
  - **Assess Impact on Services:** Evaluate the deleted tasks to determine their role in system operations, specifically looking at whether they impact security, backup, or data integrity processes.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity because the deletion of critical scheduled tasks can compromise the system's security posture and stability, potentially leading to further exploitation or data loss.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the Task Scheduler operational log has not been enabled, as it is disabled by default. Additionally, it assumes that deletions are performed using the specified usernames that could indicate legitimate administrative action, which may lead to potential false negatives. An attacker may also evade detection by bypassing these scheduled tasks or deleting logs to hide their actions.

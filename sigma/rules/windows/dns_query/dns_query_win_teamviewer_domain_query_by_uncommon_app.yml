  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "TeamViewer Domain Query By Non-TeamViewer Application" is designed to detect potentially malicious activities where non-TeamViewer applications make DNS queries to TeamViewer domains. Specifically, it looks for DNS queries to the domains `taf.teamviewer.com` and `udp.ping.teamviewer.com`. This can indicate attempts by threat actors to obfuscate their activities by using legitimate TeamViewer domain queries while running unauthorized software. 
  The rule leverages Windows DNS query logs as its primary data source. It checks for the `QueryName` field to detect specific TeamViewer domain queries while ensuring that the application making the request does not have "TeamViewer" in its image name. This is critical since cyber adversaries often exploit trusted applications to bypass security controls. The detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the "Command and Control" tactic (T1219), which involves using legitimate services for communication to evade detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs**: Investigate the endpoint's EDR logs for any recently executed processes around the time of the DNS query. Look for unusual or unauthorized applications that could have initiated the DNS request.
  - **Review DNS Logs**: Query your organization's DNS logs for other instances of DNS queries to the identified TeamViewer domains. Analyze whether these queries correlate with any known legitimate use of TeamViewer in your environment.
  - **Validate Application Legitimacy**: Use your asset inventory to validate the legitimacy of the applications that made the DNS queries. Ensure that no unauthorized software is installed that could associate with potential threat actor activities.
  - **Conduct Network Monitoring**: Analyze outbound traffic from the host that made the DNS query for connections to TeamViewer domains. Look for unusual patterns that may suggest further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is deemed medium as it indicates potential misuse of trusted applications for command and control activities. Prompt investigation is necessary to determine if a breach has occurred or if further defensive measures are required.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if a legitimate TeamViewer installation is misconfigured and making unusual DNS queries, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, it assumes that the adversary will not use a perfectly disguised application path or name to make the DNS request, which could evade detection. Situations where the application names are obfuscated or malicious software mimics legitimate applications could also be gaps in visibility. Training and awareness regarding potential software installations will aid in tuning this rule appropriately.

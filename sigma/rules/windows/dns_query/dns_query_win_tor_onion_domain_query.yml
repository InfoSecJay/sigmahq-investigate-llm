  ### Technical Context  
  This detection rule is designed to monitor DNS queries specifically targeting ".onion" addresses, which are associated with the Tor network. The presence of such queries may indicate that an internal host is attempting to communicate with anonymized services often used for clandestine activities, including command and control (C2) tactics used by threat actors. The rule leverages Windows Sysmon logs focusing on DNS query events; it looks for any instance of a query name containing the string ".onion". By identifying these queries, security analysts can recognize potential engagement with systems that could facilitate malicious activities in line with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1090.003 (Domain Generation Algorithms).
  The rule focuses on the query names captured in the DNS logs, utilizing Sysmon's monitoring capabilities to provide insights into outbound traffic behavior. By inspecting the DNS logs, analysts are equipped to determine whether a device on the network is attempting to connect to known Tor services, potentially signifying an attempt to bypass network security measures and indicating a heightened risk of compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps  
  - **Check DNS Query Logs:** Review recent DNS query logs in Sysmon or associated tools for any requests made to ".onion" domains to establish a timeline and determine associated hosts.
  - **Analyze Host Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the endpoints initiating these DNS queries, looking for any suspicious processes or unusual behaviors that correspond with the identified queries.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Investigate network logs from NDR or firewall systems to track any outbound connections to the identified ".onion" addresses, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the traffic flow and potentially malicious activities.
  - **Engage in Threat Hunting:** Search for other related indicators of compromise (IOCs) within the environment, focusing on patterns of abnormal behavior related to anonymous network traffic, which may indicate further malicious presence.
  ### Prioritization  
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential implications of a system attempting to interact with the Tor network, suggesting possible data exfiltration, unauthorized communication, or other malicious intents that pose a significant threat to enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions  
  This rule assumes that DNS logs accurately capture all relevant DNS queries; however, it may not detect blocked requests or environments using encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT) which could bypass conventional logging. Additionally, advanced adversaries may employ methods to disguise or obfuscate their DNS queries, such as using legitimate domain names, thereby evading detection by this rule. Engineers should also be aware that benign applications may use Tor for legitimate purposes, which could result in false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "DNS Query for Anonfiles.com Domain" is designed to identify potentially malicious activity by monitoring DNS queries specifically targeting the domain "anonfiles.com." This domain serves as an anonymous file upload platform, which has been associated with various malicious activities, including ransomware deployments. The rule operates by analyzing DNS query logs sourced from Windows systems, specifically focusing on any queries that contain the string ".anonfiles.com." When a device within the network resolves this domain, it may indicate a deliberate attempt to exfiltrate data or communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers. 
  This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1567.002 (Exfiltration Over Web Service), specifically highlighting the exfiltration tactic. By identifying these queries early, the security operations center (SOC) can prompt further investigation to determine whether there is a legitimate or malicious intent behind the communication attempt.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Related Processes:** Investigate the endpoint that performed the DNS query using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools. Look for any associated processes or events that may indicate suspicious activity, such as unexpected file transfers or executables.
  - **Review DNS Logs:** Analyze DNS server logs for any additional queries related to "anonfiles.com" or similar domains from the same IP address. This can help determine if there is a pattern of malicious behavior or if it was an isolated incident.
  - **Examine Network Connections:** Utilize Network Traffic Analysis tools to monitor outgoing connections from the affected device. Ensure that there are no active connections to known malicious addresses or unusual outbound traffic, which might indicate data exfiltration.
  - **Correlate with Additional Alerts:** Check the SIEM for any other related alerts or suspicious activity that occurred concurrently with the DNS query. This helps establish context and identify whether the query is part of a larger attack or incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this rule is classified as high priority due to the potential implications associated with the use of the "anonfiles.com" domain for malicious activities like data exfiltration or C2 communication. Prompt investigation is essential to mitigate risk and prevent potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if there are no requests made to the "anonfiles.com" domain, which could occur if the threat actor uses alternative methods for file transfer or utilizes different anonymous domains. Additionally, rare legitimate business uses of the site could result in false positives. It is essential for detection engineers to consider user behavior and historical access patterns when interpreting alerts to reduce unnecessary investigations.

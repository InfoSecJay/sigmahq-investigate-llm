  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect DNS queries targeting the MEGA cloud storage service, specifically the subdomain `userstorage.mega.co.nz`. This type of monitoring is critical for organizations as it can indicate potential data exfiltration activities, particularly if sensitive or proprietary information is being uploaded to a cloud service without authorization. The rule operates by analyzing DNS query logs, which capture requests made by client systems as they resolve domain names into IP addresses. When a system makes a DNS request containing the specified subdomain, the rule triggers an alert. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1567.002 (Exfiltration Over Web Service), which highlights the use of various web services for data exfiltration.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query DNS Logs**: Use your DNS logging or SIEM tool to search for recent DNS queries associated with `userstorage.mega.co.nz`; correlate with timestamps of other suspicious activities. 
  - **Examine Source Hosts**: Once identified, investigate the source hosts for abnormal behavior by looking at recent process creation events and network connections using EDR tools.
  - **Review User Activity**: Utilize User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to analyze the behavior of users who queried this domain, identifying any anomalies in their typical usage patterns.
  - **Check for File Transfers**: Investigate any recent file transfer logs or events to ensure that unauthorized data was not sent to the MEGA service, including checks on PowerShell command usage that might indicate upload attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is medium, as while legitimate use of MEGA may occur, it may also signify unauthorized data exfiltration attempts requiring further scrutiny in an enterprise context.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule can potentially fail to trigger under certain conditions, such as the use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) which would encapsulate DNS queries, evading traditional logging practices. Similarly, if an internal system resolves the domain name through a local benign method, this attack vector might remain undetected. Engineers should also consider legitimate user behavior where users may need to access MEGA for legitimate purposes.

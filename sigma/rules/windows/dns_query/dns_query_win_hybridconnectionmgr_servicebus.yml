  ### Technical Context
  The "DNS HybridConnectionManager Service Bus" Sigma rule is designed to identify potential misuse of Azure Hybrid Connection Manager services querying the Azure Service Bus service. Specifically, this rule monitors DNS query logs for the presence of the domain `servicebus.windows.net`, which is indicative of legitimate Azure service communications. The rule looks for processes named "HybridConnectionManager" that are generating these DNS queries, which are critical for the operation of Azure services. A correlation of these events can suggest potential persistence mechanisms leveraged by adversaries, as they might attempt to misuse legitimate services to maintain access within an environment. This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Persistence tactic (T1554).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check DNS Query Logs:** Review DNS query logs to confirm the presence of queries to `servicebus.windows.net`. Cross-reference with the timestamps of the alerts to identify abnormal patterns or anomalies.
  - **Validate Process Origin:** Utilize EDR tools to trace the `HybridConnectionManager` process origin and assess whether it is a legitimate instance. Examine the execution history and parent-child process relationships to ensure no unauthorized modifications have occurred.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to analyze network traffic associated with the identified queries. Look for unusual outbound connections or potential data exfiltration patterns towards the Azure Service Bus service.
  - **Review Security Events:** Check Windows Security, System, and Application logs for any unusual activity correlating with the times of the alerts, especially around the creation or manipulation of the `HybridConnectionManager` service.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been classified as high priority due to the potential for an attacker to establish persistent access via legitimate Azure services. Given the increasing trend of cloud service exploitation, immediate investigation is necessary to rule out compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are situations where this rule may not fire, such as if the adversary employs obfuscation techniques to rename `HybridConnectionManager`, or if they manipulate DNS queries without triggering the rule parameters. Furthermore, legitimate use of the Azure Hybrid Connection Manager can lead to false positives, complicating the detection of actual threats. Engineers should be aware that attacks might bypass detection by utilizing alternative communication channels or services that are not covered by this rule.

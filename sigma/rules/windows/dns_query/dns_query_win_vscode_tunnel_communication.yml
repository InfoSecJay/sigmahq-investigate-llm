  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "DNS Query To Visual Studio Code Tunnels Domain" is designed to identify DNS query requests directed at domains associated with Visual Studio Code tunneling capabilities. This capability can be exploited by attackers to create reverse shells or persistently establish connections to compromised machines. When the rule detects any DNS query ending with the suffix '.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com', it flags this activity for review, as it may indicate malicious intent using Visual Studio Code’s tunneling feature. The primary data source involved in this detection is Windows DNS query logs, specifically monitoring for DNS queries that could facilitate command and control (C2) communications. This rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics under command and control (T1071.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review DNS Query Logs:** Check the DNS logs for the specific timestamp of the alert to contextualize the user and machine behavior leading up to the query. Look for any patterns or unusual frequencies in DNS queries that might suggest malicious activity.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Utilize your EDR tool to review the activity of processes around the time of the DNS query. This can provide insight into whether a legitimate user or an unauthorized application initiated the DNS request.
  - **Inspect Process Creation Events:** Correlate the detected DNS queries with process creation logs from Sysmon to determine which applications or scripts were involved when the queries were made. Analyze any unfamiliar or suspicious processes initiated during that time.
  - **Cross-reference with User Activity:** Investigate the user accounts associated with the DNS queries in your logs. Check for any strange login patterns or suspicious activity that might support a malicious use case of Visual Studio Code’s tunneling functionality.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for abuse of the Visual Studio Code tunneling feature to facilitate command and control activities. While legitimate usage does occur, the nature of the domain queried raises concerns and should warrant a detailed investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if DNS query logging is misconfigured or not enabled on endpoints. Additionally, it assumes that all relevant traffic is captured, so if users employ alternate DNS resolvers outside of the monitored network, these activities could go unnoticed. The rule also may produce false positives for legitimate usage of Visual Studio Code tunneling, particularly in environments where developers actively use these features. Attackers may try to evade detection by utilizing different domains or encryption methods that would not trigger this specific query detection.

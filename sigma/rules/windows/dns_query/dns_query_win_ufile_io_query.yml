  ### Technical Context
  The "DNS Query to Ufile.io" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activity associated with the domain "ufile.io." This domain has been linked to data exfiltration attempts by various threat actors, often being utilized as a means to upload sensitive data outside the organization. The rule works by monitoring DNS query logs for any requests that include the string "ufile.io." The primary data source leveraged for this detection is Windows DNS query logs, which capture the outbound DNS requests made by devices within the network.
  When implemented, the rule informs incident responders about potential exfiltration tactics that align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under **Tactic: Exfiltration** and **Technique: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1567.002)**. By focusing on DNS queries, this detection method helps identify threats that may not be evident through traditional endpoint security measures, emphasizing the need for holistic monitoring of network traffic as a whole.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review DNS Query Logs:** Start by examining the DNS query logs for requests to "ufile.io" and identify the originating host. Cross-reference this information with asset inventory to determine the significance of the device involved.
  - **Assess Process Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate any processes that were active on the originating host at the time of the DNS query. Look for suspicious or unknown executables that may indicate malicious activity.
  - **Check Network Traffic:** Analyze network traffic around the time of the DNS queries using NDR solutions to see if there were any associated data transfers to or from "ufile.io." Validate if any large data uploads occurred, indicative of data exfiltration.
  - **Engage AV for Malicious Indicators:** Perform a scan using Antivirus tools on the host in question for potential malware or indicators of compromise (IOCs) correlated with the observed behavior. Follow up with threat intelligence to see if the host IP is associated with any known threats.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the association of "ufile.io" with known data exfiltration methods, this alert is prioritized as low risk in an enterprise environment. However, it still warrants investigation to ensure that no sensitive data is being compromised.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if DNS queries to "ufile.io" are obfuscated or if the threat actor uses different domains that are not recognized yet. Moreover, benign applications might generate legitimate queries to this domain, leading to potential false positives. It's also essential to assume that comprehensive DNS logging is enabled; if not, some queries may be missed entirely.

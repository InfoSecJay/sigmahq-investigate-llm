  ### Technical Context
  This rule identifies DNS queries made by the Windows application `QuickAssist.exe` specifically targeting the endpoint `remoteassistance.support.services.microsoft.com`. Quick Assist is a legitimate remote assistance tool used in scenarios such as helping users troubleshoot issues. However, threat actors have been known to misuse this application in social engineering attacks, potentially leading to initial access and the installation of malicious software. By monitoring DNS query logs associated with `QuickAssist.exe`, this detection rule helps identify unusual or unauthorized usage of this tool that may signal an ongoing attack or compromise. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Initial Access and the techniques T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols) and T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Recent Activities:** Examine EDR logs to assess the recent activities of `QuickAssist.exe`, including process creation and connection with external addresses. Determine if the behavior deviates from expected usage patterns.
    
  - **Analyze DNS Query Logs:** Review DNS logs for additional queries made by `QuickAssist.exe`, including any related subsequent domains accessed after the initial query. This can help identify whether further malicious activity occurred as a result.
    
  - **Verify with User Context:** Reach out to the user of the machine where the alert triggered to confirm whether they intended to use Quick Assist. Legitimate usage should be corroborated by the user, while any confusion may indicate potential misuse.
    
  - **Correlate with Other Indicators:** Look for correlating alerts within other security tools, such as indications of suspicious network activities or unexpected process behaviors that could complement the findings of this rule.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as low severity as it may often result from legitimate use of Quick Assist among users in the environment. However, due to the potential for misuse, it warrants investigation to rule out any unauthorized operations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `QuickAssist.exe` is disabled or not installed. Additionally, an adversary could manipulate legitimate application behaviors, rendering detection ineffective. It also assumes that typical user behavior aligns with expected usage patterns; significant deviations could go undetected if they cleverly mask malicious intent.

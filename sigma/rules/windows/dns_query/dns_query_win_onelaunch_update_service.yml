title: DNS Query Request To OneLaunch Update Service
id: df68f791-ad95-447f-a271-640a0dab9cf8
status: test
description: |
  Detects DNS query requests to "update.onelaunch.com". This domain is associated with the OneLaunch adware application.
  When the OneLaunch application is installed it will attempt to get updates from this domain.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of DNS query requests targeting the domain `update.onelaunch.com`, which is linked to the OneLaunch adware application. When the OneLaunch application is installed on a system, it periodically checks for updates through DNS requests to this specific domain. By monitoring DNS queries, particularly those made by the OneLaunch executable (`OneLaunch.exe`), this rule aids in uncovering potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) that may compromise user privacy and system integrity. The rule leverages data from DNS query logs, specifically looking for the unique domain associated with the OneLaunch service. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the `Collection` tactic and the `T1056` technique, which focuses on the collection of user input, but here it extends to the collection of data from unwanted software activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Source Process:** Check the process tree in your EDR for the `OneLaunch.exe` process and its parent processes to assess how the application was initiated and if any suspicious activities occurred in the surrounding context. 
  - **Analyze Related DNS Logs:** Review the DNS query logs around the time of the alert to see if there were any other unusual or potentially harmful queries made, which may indicate broader adware or malware activity.
  - **Assess Impact and Scope:** Examine other affected systems within the network for the presence of the OneLaunch executable and check for any additional signs of adware such as browser settings changes or unexpected software installations.
  - **Review Uninstall Procedures:** Refer to available resources for the removal of OneLaunch and determine if any affected systems require cleanup actions. Confirm that the associated registry entries and files are fully removed to prevent reinstallation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as low severity, reflecting the relatively low risk associated with OneLaunch adware. However, it warrants investigation as it may indicate the presence of unwanted software, which can lead to further security concerns if left unaddressed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection may not fire if the OneLaunch application does not utilize the specified DNS query or if DNS requests are being filtered or obfuscated through other means. Additionally, users might manually alter their DNS settings or use VPNs, preventing detection of the original query. The rule assumes that `OneLaunch.exe` will be present on the system when the detection occurs; however, if the adware is executed via a different image name or if the executable was removed before the query was logged, the rule would not trigger, potentially allowing undetected adware behavior.

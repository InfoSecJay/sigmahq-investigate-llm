  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed BOINC Client Execution" Sigma rule is designed to identify the suspicious execution of a binary that has been renamed, specifically targeting instances where the BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) executable, originally named `BOINC.exe`, is executed under a different name. This detection relies on process creation logs from Windows, which capture detailed information about newly created processes, including the original file name and the path from which the process was launched. By evaluating the `OriginalFileName` field for `BOINC.exe` and checking if the executing image ends with `\BOINC.exe`, the rule flags any discrepancies, marking them for potential investigation. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1553, which focuses on the abuse of legitimate software to evade detectionâ€”often a tactic used by adversaries to avoid scrutiny while leveraging trusted applications for nefarious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process Details:** Check process creation logs for the instance in question using your EDR tool, specifically examining the image path and other command-line parameters associated with the renamed executable.
  - **Correlate with Security Events:** Review Windows Security event logs for any associated account activity or unusual behavior at the time of the process execution to better understand the context of the incident.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Use your NDR (Network Detection and Response) tool to inspect any outbound network connections made by the process, identifying unusual or unauthorized destinations that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Cross-reference Threat Intelligence:** Investigate the file hash against threat intelligence databases (such as VirusTotal) to check for any known malicious indicators associated with the renamed execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level for this alert indicates that while the execution of a renamed BOINC binary may be a legitimate use case, it raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation within an enterprise environment, especially given the potential for misuse in an attack scenario.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the executable is not renamed or if it is executed from a known and trusted location on the network that isn't typically subject to scrutiny. Additionally, if adversaries employ advanced evasion techniques or utilize Tamper Protection settings in Windows, the detection mechanism could be bypassed. It's also important to understand that legitimate applications may use BOINC under varying names, which may inadvertently trigger false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Base64 MZ Header In CommandLine" identifies potentially malicious execution attempts by looking for specific base64-encoded MZ (Microsoft Windows executable format) headers in the command line arguments of newly created processes on Windows systems. The rule leverages process creation logs to inspect the command line for encoded strings indicative of executable code being obfuscated, which is a common tactic used by threat actors to bypass traditional security measures. When an attacker encodes a payload in base64, it allows them to disguise the true nature of their execution commands. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique "Execution" (T1203), indicating an attempt to execute code through an obfuscated command line.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to examine process creation logs for entries that match the detected command line patterns, ensuring that the parent-child relationship of processes is clearly understood. 
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters**: Investigate the command line parameters of the flagged processes to determine their context and the associated executable paths to identify any malicious binaries.
  - **Check Image Load and Network Connection**: Utilize Sysmon logs for image loads and any outbound network connections made by the identified processes to look for anomalous behavior or known malicious IP addresses.
  - **Assess User Activities**: Cross-reference the user account that initiated the process with user activity scripts or scheduled tasks in Windows logs to determine if there is any indication of privilege escalation or unauthorized account usage.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the likelihood that the presence of base64-encoded MZ headers indicates a deliberate attempt to evade detection and execute potentially harmful payloads within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule relies on the command line being accurately logged and may not fire if the command line is obfuscated using methods not captured by the detection selection. Additionally, if a legitimate application uses these encoded MZ headers, the rule may produce false negatives. Assumptions can be made that adversaries may use varying encoding methods or different obfuscation techniques that could bypass this detection, and that not all process creations will necessarily result in logging due to system policy configurations.

description: |
  Detects changes to the "DisableRestrictedAdmin" registry value in order to disable or enable RestrictedAdmin mode.
  RestrictedAdmin mode prevents the transmission of reusable credentials to the remote system to which you connect using Remote Desktop.
  This prevents your credentials from being harvested during the initial connection process if the remote server has been compromise

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for suspicious modifications to the "DisableRestrictedAdmin" registry value within Windows environments. The "DisableRestrictedAdmin" registry setting controls whether Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections transmit credentials securely, potentially exposing the credentials to attackers if altered inappropriately. By detecting process creation events that specify alterations to this registry value, the rule flags potentially malicious activities that may aim to disable the RestrictedAdmin mode, thus facilitating credential theft during RDP sessions. The primary event source utilized for this detection is Windows Sysmon's process creation logs, which provide detailed insights into command-line activities associated with processes. This rule aligns with MITRE ATT&CK's tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1112 
  - Modify Registry).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review recent process creation logs in Sysmon to identify any processes that executed commands involving the "DisableRestrictedAdmin" registry value.
  - **Examine Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters associated with the flagged processes for additional context that indicates potential malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Verify the user context in which the changes were made to ascertain whether it aligns with legitimate administrative actions or if it seems anomalous.
  - **Analyze Registry Access:** Utilize Windows Security or Sysmon logs to examine access to the registry key to understand the nature of the access (e.g., whether it was a legitimate admin user or an unauthorized entity).
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the critical nature of the RestrictedAdmin mode in preventing credential theft during RDP sessions. Any unauthorized attempts to change this registry setting may indicate malicious intent and pose significant security risks to the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the process creating the registry changes is observable within Sysmon logs, which may not capture stealthy techniques by sophisticated adversaries. Furthermore, it relies on the notion that users do not typically alter this setting without clear authorization; hence, legitimate administrative operations may be falsely flagged if investigations are not thorough. Additionally, if alternate methods of modifying the registry exist that do not invoke process creation logs, such as certain background services, the rule may fail to trigger, allowing an attack to go undetected.

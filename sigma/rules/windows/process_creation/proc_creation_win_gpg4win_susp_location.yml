  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the usage of Gpg4win, a software suite for file encryption and decryption, specifically targeting instances where it is executed from potentially suspicious directories on a Windows environment. The rule leverages data from process creation logs, focusing on command-line arguments associated with Gpg4win's executables (`gpg.exe` and `gpg2.exe`). It looks for command-line inputs containing `-passphrase`, which indicates that files are being encrypted or decrypted using a passphrase—a common mechanism for securing sensitive data. The rule targets files in paths commonly associated with temporary or public spaces on the system (e.g., `C:\Temp\`, `C:\PerfLogs\`, `C:\Users\Public\`) that may be leveraged by adversaries to obfuscate malicious activity. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution and the technique of Command-Line Interface (T1203). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Source and Destination Paths:** Examine the paths from which Gpg4win was executed and where the files were located. Look for files being encrypted/decrypted in unusual directories that may indicate suspicious activity.
  - **Check Process Origins:** Investigate the parent process of the Gpg4win execution. Use EDR tools to determine if it was initiated by a known and trusted application or if it has a suspicious lineage.
  - **Correlate with Other Indicators:** Utilize endpoint detection tools to check for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs), including recent changes in user behavior, unusual network traffic patterns, or the presence of other potentially malicious processes running in conjunction with Gpg4win.
  - **Review User Account Activity:** Analyze Windows Security logs for any anomalies related to user accounts that executed the Gpg4win processes. Look for credential theft indicators or logins from unusual locations.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is considered high due to the potential for malicious actors to use Gpg4win for data exfiltration or securing payloads within an organization's infrastructure. This activity often signifies an evasive attack or data loss opportunity, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if Gpg4win is executed from less common directories or if attackers rename or obfuscate their tools to bypass detection. Additionally, legitimate instances of Gpg4win usage for non-malicious purposes may trigger false positives. The assumption is made that the detection logic adequately captures both versions of Gpg4win, but attackers could use alternative tools or packages that may not be monitored by this rule.

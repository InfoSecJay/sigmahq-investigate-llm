title: Arbitrary Shell Command Execution Via Settingcontent-Ms
id: 24de4f3b-804c-4165-b442-5a06a2302c7e
status: test
description: The .SettingContent-ms file type was introduced in Windows 10 and allows
  a user to create "shortcuts" to various Windows 10 setting pages. These files are
  simply XML and contain paths to various Windows 10 settings binaries.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential arbitrary shell command execution via the use of `.SettingContent-ms` files in a Windows environment. These files, introduced in Windows 10, serve as shortcuts to various Windows settings and can be maliciously crafted to execute commands, specifically by leveraging the `immersivecontrolpanel` application. The rule identifies process creation events that contain the `.SettingContent-ms` file extension in the command line, while simultaneously filtering out benign instances that involve the `immersivecontrolpanel`. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1204 (User Execution) and T1566.001 (Phishing: Spear Phishing Attachment), highlighting how attackers may exploit legitimate features as vectors for command execution under the guise of common settings.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Source of Execution**: Check the event logs from the EDR or Windows Security logs for the source of the process creation. Determine if the originating process is a trusted application or if it exhibits any suspicious behavior.
    
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments**: Review the command line associated with the process creation event. Look for any obfuscated or unusual commands that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Inspect Parent Process**: Investigate the `ParentProcess` field to identify the process that initiated the command execution. Assess the legitimacy of this parent process and any associated activity.
  - **Cross-reference Network Activity**: Use network logs from the firewall or proxy to observe any outbound connections initiated by the suspected process. Validate whether these connections align with known malicious IPs or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risk it poses in executing arbitrary commands, which could lead to further exploitation or compromising of the system if confirmed malicious. 
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where attackers employ legitimate processes not filtered out by the rule, or if they utilize alternative methods to execute commands without involving `.SettingContent-ms` files. Additionally, there may be false negatives if the command line does not adhere to the expected format. Analysts should be aware of the possibility of sophisticated adversaries who could modify commands in a manner that evades detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect unauthorized or suspicious password changes initiated by the logged-on user using the `ksetup.exe` utility, which is primarily used to configure Kerberos client settings in Windows environments. The detection mechanism is driven by process creation logs that track instances of `ksetup.exe`. Specifically, the rule monitors for instances where the image path concludes with `\ksetup.exe` and the command line contains the `/ChangePassword` parameter. When both of these criteria are met, the rule is triggered, indicating a potential security event that warrants further investigation. This activity directly correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of *Execution* and technique of *Command and Scripting Interpreter* (T1059), as it potentially signals the manipulation of user credentials or other illicit activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Context of the Alert**: Utilize the EDR to confirm details of the user session, including the identity of the user, and timestamps to determine if the password change request was legitimate or anomalous.
  - **Examine Command-line Arguments**: Analyze the command-line arguments used in the process creation logs to validate whether `/ChangePassword` was the intended command and check for any additional suspicious parameters.
  - **Check Event Logs for Related Activities**: Look into the Windows Security Event Logs for any events indicating account changes or failed login attempts correlated with the user's activity around the time of the alert.
  - **Correlate with User Behavior Analytics**: Utilize user behavior analytics tools or additional telemetry such as VPN or Proxy logs to assess typical user behavior, identifying any anomalies that align with the detected password change.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential impact of unauthorized password alterations, which can lead to broader access to sensitive systems and data. However, context is crucial; legitimate password changes by users are common.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where `ksetup.exe` operations are executed under a different filename or through obfuscation techniques that mask the original command line. Additionally, the rule assumes that the environment is configured to log process creation events sufficiently, which may not be the case if logging levels are not appropriately set. Attackers may also circumvent this detection by employing other methods for password changes or modifications through authorized administrative tasks without invoking `ksetup.exe` directly.

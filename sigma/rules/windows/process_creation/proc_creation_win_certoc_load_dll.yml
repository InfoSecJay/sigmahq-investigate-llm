  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious activity surrounding the use of `CertOC.exe`, a legitimate utility for certificate management on Windows systems, that has been co-opted for DLL loading. The rule triggers when `CertOC.exe` loads a target DLL file through the command line argument `-LoadDLL`. The primary data source for this detection is process creation logs, where key attributes such as the process image path and the command-line parameters are scrutinized. By monitoring these attributes, analysts can detect misuse of certificate installation mechanisms, linking it to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion and the technique T1218. This can indicate attempts by adversaries to load malicious code into legitimate processes bypassing security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the execution of `CertOC.exe`, focusing on the command line usage and any associated DLLs loaded during this invocation. 
  - **Correlate Parent Process Information:** Examine the parent process of `CertOC.exe` in Windows Security logs to identify how this process was initiated and if it is linked to suspicious activity.
  - **Investigate Loaded DLLs:** Use Sysmon logs to extract and analyze the DLLs that were loaded in conjunction with `CertOC.exe`, checking for known malicious DLLs or any unsigned files.
  - **Network Activity Analysis:** Monitor network connections for the behavior of the host performing the action, particularly focusing on any outbound traffic to suspicious domains or IPs that may indicate further compromise. 
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has a medium priority level due to the moderate risk associated with the misuse of legitimate system tools for potentially malicious activities. However, while not all instances of `CertOC.exe` represent a threat, they warrant investigation due to the possibility of evasion techniques being employed by adversaries.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if `CertOC.exe` is employed without the `-LoadDLL` parameter or if the adversary uses other mechanisms for DLL loading that do not involve this tool. Furthermore, if `CertOC.exe` is altered or repackaged, standard detection mechanisms may fail. It's assumed that the necessary Sysmon and process creation logs are available and that EDR is configured to capture this activity effectively.

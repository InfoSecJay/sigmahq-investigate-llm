  ### Technical Context
  The rule titled "Suspicious Rundll32 Execution With Image Extension" aims to identify anomalous behaviors associated with the execution of `rundll32.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility that runs functions stored in dynamic link libraries (DLLs). In adversarial techniques, this utility is often misused for executing malicious code, particularly by hiding the actual nature of the DLL being run. This detection rule specifically looks for instances where `rundll32.exe` is executed with command-line parameters that resemble image file formats (such as `.jpg`, `.png`, and others). By monitoring process creation logs for such behaviors, the detection mechanism can uncover attempts to distribute malware or other unauthorized actions that typically try to evade traditional security measures. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1218.011).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution History:** Use EDR tools to check for the execution history of `rundll32.exe`. Pay attention to any suspicious command-line arguments, particularly those that reference image file extensions.
  - **Correlate with Network Activities:** Use your NDR tool to investigate any outbound network connections that occurred around the same time as the detected `rundll32.exe` execution. Look for any unusual patterns or connections to known malicious IP addresses.
  - **Review Endpoint Logs:** Analyze Windows event logs (particularly Security and Sysmon) for any signs of process tampering or additional unauthorized access attempts related to `rundll32.exe`. Focus on parent-child process relationships to trace originating activities.
  - **Search for Malware Artifacts:** Utilize AV solutions to scan the machine where the alert was generated. Look for any DLLs or files that may have been dropped by the suspicious execution which could indicate malware presence.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high priority due to the potential use of legitimate system utilities for malicious purposes, which poses a significant risk to organizational security. Rapid response is critical to mitigate the potential impact of malware or persistent threats exploiting this behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `rundll32.exe` executions do not use image file extensions as command-line arguments, potentially allowing some adversarial techniques to remain undetected. Additionally, if an attacker renames their malicious DLLs to standard executable names or uses other evasion tactics, they may bypass this detection. It is also assumed that Sysmon is configured correctly to log process creation events; gaps in logging would hinder detection efficacy.

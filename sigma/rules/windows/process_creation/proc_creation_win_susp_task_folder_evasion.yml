title: Tasks Folder Evasion
id: cc4e02ba-9c06-48e2-b09e-2500cace9ae0
status: test
description: |
  The Tasks folder in system32 and syswow64 are globally writable paths.
  Adversaries can take advantage of this and load or influence any script hosts or ANY .NET Application
  in Tasks to load and execute a custom assembly into cscript, wscript, regsvr32, mshta, eventvwr

  ### Technical Context
  The "Tasks Folder Evasion" Sigma rule detects potential attempts by adversaries to exploit the globally writable Task folders located in `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\` and `C:\Windows\SysWow64\Tasks\`. These paths are susceptible to malicious actors due to their accessibility, allowing them to manipulate script hosts like `cscript`, `wscript`, and other applications to load custom assemblies. The rule primarily monitors process creation events, analyzing command line arguments for specific keywords indicative of possible file manipulation or creation activities within the Task folders. By monitoring these command line invocations, the SOC can identify potentially malicious activity that aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for defense evasion (T1574.002) and persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the Command Line:** Examine the command line associated with the alert in the EDR tool to identify any legitimate or potentially malicious commands targeting the Task folders.
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Investigate the parent process responsible for the creation of the task to determine if it is a known legitimate application or service.
  - **Review File Changes:** Utilize file integrity monitoring tools to inspect recent changes or creations in the Task folders, analyzing for any unexpected modifications.
  - **Investigate Related Network Activity:** Check for any associated outbound connections or communication that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control (C2) interactions linked to the task creation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the potential for persistent malicious activity and evasion of security controls, which could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code within trusted system processes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if an adversary employs obfuscation or uses alternative methods for code execution that do not involve the monitored command line patterns. Additionally, it assumes that sufficient logging is enabled and operational within the environment, as any missing logs could result in undetected malicious activity. There might also be false positives for legitimate administrative activities inadvertently mimicking this pattern, which may require contextual human analysis to discern.

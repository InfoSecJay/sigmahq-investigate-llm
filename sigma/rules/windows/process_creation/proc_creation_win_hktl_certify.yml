  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "HackTool 
  - Certify Execution" is designed to detect the execution of the "Certify" tool, a popular utility utilized for Active Directory (AD) certificate abuse. This detection works by analyzing process creation events and looking for specific metadata characteristics associated with the executable, including its name, original file name, and description. The rule also inspects command-line arguments for flags that indicate potentially malicious uses of the tool, such as those related to certificate requests and security vulnerabilities. The primary data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, specifically monitoring for instances of "Certify.exe" being executed with suspicious command-line parameters. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Discovery (T1087) and Credential Access (T1649), as it targets tools that can gather sensitive credential information and manipulate certificate services.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate instances of "Certify.exe" execution in the Windows Event Logs under the Security category to determine the origin of the execution, including user accounts and timestamps. 
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line arguments associated with the detected "Certify.exe" processes. Look for specific terms such as '/vulnerable', '/template:', and '/domain:' to assess intent and potential misuse.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Use the EDR tool to correlate the execution with other user activities around the same time, especially any administrative actions in Active Directory that may indicate broader credential theft or abuse.
  - **Search for Network Activity:** Review network connection logs from your NDR or firewall to check for any outbound connections that "Certify.exe" may have initiated. Investigate any suspicious destinations that can determine if data exfiltration is occurring.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule are considered high severity due to the nature of the execution of a tool designed for certificate abuse, which indicates a potential compromise of sensitive credential data and could lead to substantial security incidents.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the proper logging and monitoring of process creation activities. It may fail to trigger if the tool is renamed or executed from an unexpected path, altering the identifiable characteristics or command-line parameters. Additionally, if the environment lacks comprehensive logging configurations for process creation events or if logs are not retained for a sufficient period, the rule may miss relevant activity. Adversaries could also evade detection through the use of obfuscation techniques, making it crucial to maintain a holistic security posture beyond just this detection rule.

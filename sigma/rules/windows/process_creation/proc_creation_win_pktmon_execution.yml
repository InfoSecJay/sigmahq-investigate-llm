  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting the execution of PktMon.EXE focuses on identifying when this specific network packet capturing utility is executed within a Windows environment. PktMon, a tool included with Windows, is often used for legitimate network monitoring purposes; however, adversaries can also exploit this tool to capture sensitive network traffic covertly. The detection mechanism relies on process creation logs, utilizing parameters such as the image name and original file name (acknowledging both forms to prevent evasion through renaming). This detection is categorized under the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** tactic of Credential Access, specifically technique **T1040**, which pertains to "Network Sniffing."
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Log:** Use your EDR solution to query process creation events for instances of `pktmon.exe` and correlate the timestamp with other activities that could indicate potential malicious use.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Examine network connection logs through your NDR or firewall to identify any suspicious traffic patterns or unexpected data transmissions that align with the execution of PktMon.
  - **Review User Context:** Look at the user account that executed PktMon and validate its legitimacy, especially if it was run by a service account or an unfamiliar user that doesn't typically engage in network monitoring activities.
  - **Analyze File Integrity:** Utilize your AV or endpoint security tools to check if PktMon.exe has been modified or if there's a presence of any other suspicious binaries that could indicate further compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert warrants a **medium severity** classification due to the dual nature of PktMon; while primarily a legitimate tool, its potential use by adversaries for capturing sensitive network data poses a significant risk in a corporate environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if PktMon is executed under a different name or if it is executed through PowerShell or other scripting methods that do not generate standard process creation logs. Additionally, legitimate administrative activity may trigger false positives, as network administrators might utilize PktMon for its intended purpose. Analysts should also consider that sophisticated adversaries could use similar tools, renaming or obfuscating them to evade detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activities where the PowerShell cmdlet `Set-Service` is used to alter the startup type of services to "disabled" or "manual". The manipulation of service startup types is a common technique used by adversaries to hinder critical services, thereby evading defenses and maintaining persistence on compromised systems. The rule leverages process creation logs, focusing specifically on instances where PowerShell is invoked with the relevant command line arguments that indicate modification of service configurations. 
  The identified MITRE ATT&CK tactic for this rule is "Execution" and the technique is categorized as "T1562.001: Disable or Tamper with Security Tools". By monitoring command-line parameters, specifically those that include `Set-Service` in conjunction with values such as "Disabled" or "Manual," the detection rule helps pinpoint unauthorized changes to service configurations that might indicate nefarious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review PowerShell Execution History:** Investigate the execution history of PowerShell instances on the affected system using the EDR to determine the context and frequency of `Set-Service` commands.
  - **Correlate with Event Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for unusual authentication events or failed logins that might coincide with the suspected change in service statuses.
  - **Examine Affected Services:** Identify the services whose startup types were altered and assess their importance to system functionality, noting if any critical services were disabled.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs from the NGFW or Proxy to identify any remote connections or communications initiated by the affected system around the time the command was executed, as this may indicate lateral movement.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is deemed medium due to the potential for service manipulation that can lead to broader exploitation, but it may also arise from legitimate administrative actions or troubleshooting, necessitating further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger for legitimate administrative changes where authorized personnel are known to modify service settings. Furthermore, it may fail to detect obfuscation techniques or alternate methods used by adversaries to change service startup types without invoking PowerShell explicitly. Security teams should be aware that sophisticated adversaries could employ stealthy means to disable services without generating notable logs, thus bypassing this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Amazon SSM Agent Hijacking" detects suspicious activity linked to Amazon's Simple Systems Manager (SSM) agent on Windows systems. The rule primarily inspects process creation logs to identify when the SSM agent process (`amazon-ssm-agent.exe`) is launched with specific command-line parameters indicative of potential hijacking attempts. These parameters include flags such as `-register`, `-code`, `-id`, and `-region`, which, when used improperly, can suggest an attempt by an adversary to exploit the SSM agent as a means of remote access persistence, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219 (Remote Access Tools). This detection leverages Windows event logs that track the creation of processes, focusing specifically on characteristics that diverge from typical administrative use.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Enumeration:** Utilize EDR tools to capture the list of running processes, paying close attention to any unexpected instances of `amazon-ssm-agent.exe` operational outside of scheduled maintenance or updates.
    
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line parameters used for the identified process to determine if they match the suspicious patterns outlined in the Sigma rule.
  - **Analyze System Logs:** Examine Windows Event Logs for additional context regarding user activity, looking for correlation with access logs from AWS Management Console or any unusual login attempts.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Utilize network detection tools to monitor outbound traffic from the affected endpoint, looking for signs of communication that may indicate remote control or data exfiltration activities stemming from the SSM agent.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is set to medium due to the potential for significant impact if the SSM agent is leveraged for unauthorized remote access. While not every alert will indicate malicious activity, the combination of the process and command-line parameters warrants prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in scenarios where adversaries utilize non-standard naming conventions for malicious executables or if the legitimate SSM agent usage does not include the specified command-line arguments. Additionally, the reliance on process creation logs may miss attacks that employ legitimate administrative tools in unforeseen ways. Responders should also keep in mind that dedicated threat actors may develop methods to camouflage their activities or modify legitimate processes to avoid detection.

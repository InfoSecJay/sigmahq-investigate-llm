title: Detection of PowerShell Execution via Sqlps.exe
id: 0152550d-3a26-4efd-9f0e-54a0b28ae2f3
status: test
description: |
  This rule detects execution of a PowerShell code through the sqlps.exe utility, which is included in the standard set of utilities supplied with the MSSQL Server.
  Script blocks are not logged in this case, so this utility helps to bypass protection mechanisms based on the analysis of these logs.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially suspicious activity involving the execution of PowerShell scripts through the `sqlps.exe` utility, which is a command-line tool included with Microsoft SQL Server. The rule focuses on instances where `sqlps.exe` is either executed directly or invoked by a parent process, specifically looking for command-line activities associated with it. It leverages Windows process creation logs to track the execution of `sqlps.exe`, analyzing both the parent image and the parameters passed during the execution. The absence of logging for script blocks during the use of `sqlps.exe` makes it a favored vehicle for threat actors seeking to execute PowerShell commands while evading standard detection mechanisms. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059.001) and Defense Evasion (T1127), highlighting the tool's utility in circumventing security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Alerts:** Use your EDR solution to look for alerts related to `sqlps.exe` execution, focusing on associated processes and command-line arguments to contextualize the activity.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Examine Windows Security, System, and Application logs around the time of the detection to identify if any unusual user activity occurred prior to the execution of `sqlps.exe`.
  - **Validate Parent-Child Relationships:** Confirm the parent-child relationship of processes to determine if `sqlps.exe` was started suspiciously by an unauthorized parent process.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** If applicable, analyze network connections made by the `sqlps.exe` process to identify any outbound communications that might indicate data exfiltration or command and control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level of this alert indicates that while the execution of PowerShell via `sqlps.exe` can be a legitimate activity, it is often exploited by attackers to bypass security controls. Thus, a deeper investigation is warranted to rule out potential malicious behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where `sqlps.exe` is executed legitimately without a suspicious parent process, leading to false negatives in environments where this tool is traditionally used without incident. Additionally, if an adversary modifies the execution of `sqlps.exe` to appear benign or employs techniques to obfuscate the process creation, the rule may not detect such activities. It's essential for detection engineers to consider these scenarios when deploying or refining the rule.

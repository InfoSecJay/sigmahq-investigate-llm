  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "DLL Sideloading by VMware Xfer Utility" is designed to detect the execution of the VMware Xfer utility (VMwareXferlogs.exe) from non-default directories. This could indicate a potential adversary attempting to sideload malicious DLLs into legitimate processes, which falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the technique T1574.002, specifically focused on the misuse of trusted applications to execute unauthorized code. The rule utilizes process creation logs that indicate when the VMwareXferlogs.exe is executed. By checking if the image path does not start with the default installation directory (C:\Program Files\VMware\), the rule aims to flag any anomalies in its execution path that could signify active exploitation by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Start by examining the process creation logs for entries related to VMwareXferlogs.exe to determine if it was executed outside of its default installation path. Look at the associated parent processes for contextual clues on the execution chain.
  - **Analyze DLL Load Events:** Check for relevant Sysmon events that indicate any arbitrary DLLs loaded by VMwareXferlogs.exe. This can help identify any malicious code that may have been injected into the process.
  - **Cross-reference EDR Alerts:** Use the EDR to look for any suspicious activity correlating with the timing of the execution of VMwareXferlogs.exe. Analyze behavioral patterns that may indicate the compromise lifecycle, such as lateral movement or additional payload deployment.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Inspect network traffic logs for any outbound connections initiated by the VMwareXferlogs.exe process. Unusual or unauthorized connections could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as high severity due to the potential for significant impact on the organization, as DLL sideloading can lead to undetected malware execution and control over compromised systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if VMwareXferlogs.exe is invoked from a default location or if the threat actor uses renamed or alternative utilities. Additionally, if the adversary deletes the process creation logs or obscures the legitimate execution paths, the rule may fail to fire. Analysts should also be aware that legitimate administrative activities can occasionally generate false positives if VMwareXferlogs.exe is executed from non-standard locations for legitimate purposes.

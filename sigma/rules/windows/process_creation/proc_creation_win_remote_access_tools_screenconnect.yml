title: Remote Access Tool - ScreenConnect Execution
id: 57bff678-25d1-4d6c-8211-8ca106d12053
status: test
description: |
  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting Remote Access Tool (RAT) execution via ScreenConnect provides critical insights into unauthorized remote access attempts in an enterprise environment. The rule primarily analyzes process creation logs to identify interactions with the ScreenConnect service. When this rule is triggered, it indicates that the ScreenConnect application—legitimately used for remote support and often allowed in enterprise environments—has been executed. The detection leverages parameters from process creation logs, specifically looking for entries containing the 'ScreenConnect' product and ‘ScreenConnect Software’ as the company name. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics under command-and-control (Technique T1219), highlighting the potential for adversaries to exploit such software for nefarious purposes once they've gained initial access to a network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Check process creation logs in Windows Event Logs to confirm the execution of the ScreenConnect application. Look for relevant timestamps and user accounts associated with the launch.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to determine if any other suspicious activities correlate with the ScreenConnect execution, such as additional unusual processes or network connections.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Inspect network logs for any outbound connections made by the ScreenConnect application to external IP addresses. Pay particular attention to any unrecognized or suspicious hosts.
  - **Conduct User Account Review:** Assess the user account that executed the ScreenConnect process for unusual behavior or access patterns that may indicate compromised credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized access facilitated by legitimate software. While the tool itself can have valid business applications, its usage may indicate an adversarial foothold requiring immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in certain scenarios where ScreenConnect is already whitelisted in application control or if the adversary modifies the application's properties to evade detection. Additionally, the use of legitimate administrative privileges may mask unusual activity. Engineers should consider the potential for false negatives if logging is insufficient or misconfigured. It's crucial to remain aware of the operational context wherein the authorized use of ScreenConnect may exist, as it can complicate investigations.

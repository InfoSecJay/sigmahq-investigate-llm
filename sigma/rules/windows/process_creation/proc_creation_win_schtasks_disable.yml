  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the disabling of critical Windows scheduled tasks, which can be indicative of malicious activities aimed at facilitating data destruction or evading security mechanisms. The rule focuses on monitoring the execution of the `schtasks.exe` command-line tool, specifically looking for commands that include parameters for modifying the state of scheduled tasks to disable them. The key elements that the rule checks for include the presence of the `'/Change'` and `'/disable'` flags in the command line, along with specific task names associated with essential Windows functions like BitLocker, Windows Defender, and System Restore. By monitoring these actions, the rule aims to uncover potential adversarial behavior in line with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1489 (Data Destruction).
  The primary data sources used in this detection involve process creation logs that track the execution of processes, in particular `schtasks.exe`, along with the associated command-line arguments that provide context on the actions being taken. Such monitoring can help identify disruptive attempts by attackers, enabling timely incident response.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation events in your EDR for instances of `schtasks.exe` that include the relevant command-line arguments as specified in the rule. Pay special attention to the timestamps and user accounts associated with these actions.
    
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Investigate any concurrent alerts from other security tools such as AV or EDR that may indicate related malicious activities, like indicators of compromise (IOCs) or unusual network behavior.
  - **Analyze Scheduled Tasks:** Assess the status of the scheduled tasks mentioned in the command line against their expected operational state. Note changes that could indicate unauthorized modifications or disruptions to normal operations.
  - **User Behavior Audit:** Examine the affected user accounts for unusual behavior or compromise indicators. Investigating login patterns and access to sensitive areas of the network can reveal further insights into potential breaches.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because the disabling of critical scheduled tasks can result in significant vulnerabilities and exposure to data loss within the enterprise environment, facilitating further attacks or the execution of harmful operations.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  One major blind spot may be legitimate administrative changes where a system administrator has disabled tasks for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes. This rule may not fire if obfuscation techniques are employed by an adversary, such as using different executables or command-line flags that do not match the expected patterns. Additionally, if the `schtasks.exe` activity occurs outside of normal operational hours, it may be overlooked. Proper change management and logging measures can help mitigate these risks.

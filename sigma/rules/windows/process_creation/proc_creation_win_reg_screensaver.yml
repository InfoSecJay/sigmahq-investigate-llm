status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity.
  Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious ScreenSave Change by Reg.exe" aims to detect potential persistence mechanisms employed by adversaries via modifications to the Windows screensaver settings using the `reg.exe` command-line utility. The rule specifically looks for instances where the registry key settings related to screensavers, located at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`, are altered. The rule tracks the command-line parameters of the `reg.exe` process to identify suspicious changes, such as enabling the screensaver, setting a specific timeout, or linking a screensaver to a malicious executable with a `.scr` extension. 
  In this context, threat actors may manipulate screensaver settings to ensure that malicious payloads are executed during periods of user inactivity, making it a stealthy technique for achieving persistence. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic is "Privilege Escalation," with an associated technique coded as T1546.002, which highlights the use of system features, like screensavers, for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for any unusual activity involving the `reg.exe` process, particularly around the timestamps of the suspicious registry modifications.
    
  - **Review Windows Security Logs:** Examine Windows Security logs for audit events corresponding to process creation, ensuring that system processes are behaving as expected and not executing unauthorized commands.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Determine the command-line arguments used when the registry changes were made; compare these against known legitimate usage to identify anomalies.
  - **Look for Screensaver Executables:** Investigate the file system for the presence of any `.scr` files that were set by the `reg.exe` command, especially in unusual locations or with abnormal file properties.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for adversaries to establish persistence through seemingly benign system features, which, while not immediately catastrophic, could lead to further exploitation and compromise if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where screensaver settings are routinely managed through Group Policy Objects (GPOs), as these legitimate changes could produce false positives. Additionally, if an attacker uses an alternative method, such as PowerShell or scripts, to modify registry settings without invoking `reg.exe`, the rule may not detect such behavior. It is assumed that proper auditing and logging practices are enabled across the enterprise; lack of logs from relevant processes could hinder detection efforts.

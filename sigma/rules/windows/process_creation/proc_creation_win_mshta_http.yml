  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for remotely hosted HTA files executed via Mshta.EXE targets potential malicious activities where an attacker uses the Microsoft HTML Application Host (Mshta.EXE) to run HTML applications hosted over the internet. This rule specifically looks for instances where Mshta.EXE is executed with command-line arguments containing HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP protocols, indicating that the HTA file is sourced from a remote server. The relevant technical data sources include process creation logs, which capture detailed information about process invocations, command-line parameters used during execution, and the characteristics of the executing image. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of Defense Evasion and Execution, specifically technique T1218.005 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query Process Creation Logs:** Use the SIEM to query for logs related to Mshta.EXE executions, focusing on command-line parameters that include 'http', 'https', or 'ftp'.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the complete command-line information for context on the executed HTA file and the remote server it contacted to gather additional indicators of compromise.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Check EDR and NDR systems for any network connections initiated from the workstation executing Mshta.EXE, particularly those communicating with the mentioned remote URLs.
  - **Review Endpoint Protection Logs:** Look into AV logs and alerts to determine if any threat detection mechanisms flagged the HTA file or Mshta.EXE processes based on behavior or signatures.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for significant malicious activity; the execution of remote HTA files can lead to malware delivery, data exfiltration, or other exploitations if not promptly investigated.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if Mshta.EXE is invoked without using any of the specified HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP arguments; therefore, it's essential for incident responders to remain vigilant for other indicators of local HTA file executions. Additionally, the rule assumes Mshta.EXE is being run on a system with standard logging enabled; environments with disabled process creation logging may fail to capture this activity. Adversaries may also utilize obfuscation techniques to modify command-line arguments, bypassing detection.

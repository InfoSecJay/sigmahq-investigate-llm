  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of a renamed version of the PSEXESVC service, an often-abused tool for remote process execution within Windows environments. When the renaming of this service occurs, it usually indicates a potential nefarious intention, as legitimate administrative tasks rarely utilize a modified form of `psexesvc.exe`. The rule utilizes process creation logs to identify when an executable with the original filename `psexesvc.exe` is triggered but from an unusual or unauthorized path, specifically `C:\Windows\PSEXESVC.exe`. This activity is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK technique under the "Execution" tactic, indicating a potential illicit execution pattern that should be investigated further.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine process creation logs and verify the context of the psexesvc execution, paying attention to the command-line parameters and parent processes.
  - **Check for Service Installation:** Access Windows Services through the System Log to confirm if a service with the name `PSEXESVC` has been newly installed or modified, correlating it to the timestamp of the alert.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Review network activities linked to the psexesvc execution using NDR or firewall logs to find any suspicious outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Assess Endpoint Behavior:** Query anomaly detection in AV logs for unusual behaviors associated with the endpoints running the psexesvc service, which might indicate exploitation or malware presence.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential misuse of the PSEXESVC service for malicious purposes. In an enterprise environment, such activities can indicate a serious security breach, requiring immediate investigation to mitigate any potential threats.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the service may be renamed or its execution path altered without being logged in a standard way. Blind spots include scenarios where legitimate usage of altered PSEXESVC occurs under unusual circumstances, or where adversaries may use alternate legitimate tools to achieve similar results without triggering the rule. The rule may also not fire in scenarios where the service binary is executed from a non-standard path or during stealthy operations by attackers.

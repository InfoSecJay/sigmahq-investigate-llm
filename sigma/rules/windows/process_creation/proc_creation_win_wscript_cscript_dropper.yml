  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of potentially malicious scripts via Windows Script Host (WSH) tools, specifically `wscript.exe` and `cscript.exe`. The rule targets script files located in user directories, particularly those within temporary directories (e.g., `C:\Temp`, `C:\Users\Public`, etc.) and emphasizes file extensions commonly associated with scripts like JavaScript (`.js`, `.jse`) and Visual Basic scripts (`.vbs`, `.vba`). By monitoring process creation logs and analyzing command-line arguments, the rule identifies suspicious script execution patterns that may indicate an attempt to deploy malware, particularly through scripted payloads.
  The rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution and the techniques T1059.005 (PowerShell) and T1059.007 (Visual Basic Script), highlighting the use of scripts as a delivery mechanism for malicious actions in Windows environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Related Activity:** Inspect the endpoint's EDR logs for additional suspicious activity around the time of the alert, focusing on other process creations or anomalies related to `wscript.exe` or `cscript.exe`.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line parameters associated with the detected script execution to determine if they contain obfuscated content or reference known malicious patterns.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize network logs to find outbound connections originating from the affected host during the time of script execution, as this may indicate command and control communication or data exfiltration.
  - **Conduct User Behavior Analysis:** Investigate the user accounts associated with the execution of the script, checking for any unusual behavior or anomalies in user access, particularly if the account is not typically involved in such activities.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert indicates the execution of scripts from user directories that are often used by attackers to execute malicious payloads, it should be prioritized as medium severity in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the attacker uses other execution methods or legitimate development tools that mimic user behavior. Additionally, it assumes that the baseline activity regarding script execution has been established to distinguish between legitimate installs and potential threats. Lastly, if scripts are executed without utilizing `wscript.exe` or `cscript.exe`, this detection rule will not fire, leading to potential evasion by skilled adversaries.

description: |
  Detects a suspicious copy operation that tries to copy a known LOLBIN from system (System32, SysWOW64, WinSxS) directories to another on disk in order to bypass detections based on locations.

  ### Technical Context
  The "LOL-Binary Copied From System Directory" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity where a legitimate Windows utility (often referred to as a living-off-the-land binary or LOLBIN) is copied from a common system directory—namely System32, SysWOW64, or WinSxS—to another location on disk. This tactic is often employed by attackers to evade detection mechanisms that monitor the execution of these binaries in their native system directories. The rule achieves this by monitoring the process creation events that involve command-line operations, specifically looking for the `copy`, `copy-item`, or their equivalents in other tools, along with the presence of known LOLBINs in the command line. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic linked to this behavior falls under "Defense Evasion" and is specifically categorized as T1036.003, which addresses the use of LOLBINs.
  The detection leverages Windows Security event logs alongside Sysmon logs, focusing on command-line parameters that indicate copying actions. The inclusion of common system directories in the command line strings enhances the likelihood of capturing malicious activity while helping to reduce false positives.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Suspicious Process Creation Events:** Check EDR logs for newly created processes matching the criteria, paying close attention to their parent processes for context.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate command-line parameters associated with the copied binaries to confirm the source and target paths are within the identified system directories.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Use Security and Sysmon logs to identify any prior or subsequent activity related to the detected process, which may indicate a coordinated attack.
  - **Inspect Related Artifacts:** Identify any files copied during the detected operation and explore their behavior using threat intelligence platforms for correlations with known frameworks or threats.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential risk of malicious actors using legitimate system tools to circumvent traditional security measures, which could lead to significant compromise scenarios within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger in scenarios where attackers utilize other methods of evasion, such as renaming binaries after copying or using non-standard tools that are not accounted for in the rule. Additionally, environments where logging is not adequately configured or where administrative privileges are abused may also leave gaps in detection. Another important assumption is that the rule presumes the captured binaries are directly executed, rather than being part of a more complex attack chain or obfuscated process that may not be visible.

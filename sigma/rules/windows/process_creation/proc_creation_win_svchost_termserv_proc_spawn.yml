  ### Technical Context
  The "Terminal Service Process Spawn" detection rule identifies potentially malicious behavior involving the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on Windows systems. Specifically, it focuses on detecting instances where a subprocess is created by the Terminal Services server process (`termsvcs`), as this may indicate exploitation of the vulnerability CVE-2019-0708, also known as "BlueKeep." This vulnerability could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The rule monitors Windows process creation logs, specifically looking for the command line of parent processes that contain `svchost.exe` and `termsvcs`, while filtering out known legitimate images such as `rdpclip.exe`, `csrss.exe`, `wininit.exe`, and `winlogon.exe`. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the initial access and lateral movement tactics and techniques (T1190, T1210).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Tree:** Examine the process tree in your EDR tool to investigate the parent process of the flagged subprocess. Identify any anomalies in the process lineage that could indicate lateral movement or exploitation.
    
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command line arguments used by the detected process. Look for any indicators of suspicious or unusual activity that could suggest malicious intent.
    
  - **Cross-reference with Security Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for authentication events around the time of the alert. This might help determine if unauthorized users accessed the system or if there were unusual authentication attempts.
    
  - **Perform Network Analysis:** Utilize NDR tools to inspect any network connections initiated by the suspicious process. Focus on identifying any external connections or communications that could suggest data exfiltration or further compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of the RDP vulnerability being monitored, as a successful exploitation could lead to complete system compromise and further lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where RDP is not used, or if system logging for process creation is disabled or improperly configured. Additionally, legitimate use of RDP may generate false positives if applications or scripts routinely spawn processes that meet the detection criteria. An adversary could also alter their tactics to exploit other processes or use obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

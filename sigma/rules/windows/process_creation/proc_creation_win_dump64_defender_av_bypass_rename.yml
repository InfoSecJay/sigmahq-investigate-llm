title: Potential Windows Defender AV Bypass Via Dump64.EXE Rename
id: 129966c9-de17-4334-a123-8b58172e664d
status: test
description: |
  Detects when a user is potentially trying to bypass the Windows Defender AV by renaming a tool to dump64.exe and placing it in the Visual Studio folder.
  Currently the rule is covering only usage of procdump but other utilities can be added in order to increase coverage.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential attempts to bypass Windows Defender Antivirus (AV) by monitoring for the renaming of certain tools to `dump64.exe` within the Microsoft Visual Studio directory. Specifically, the rule looks for events where a process is created with an image path that starts with "C:\Program Files" and contains the path to Microsoft Visual Studio, with the executable name specifically being `dump64.exe`. It leverages process creation logs to detect when a known tool, specifically ProcDump, is being utilized with command-line arguments that suggest an intention to capture full or partial memory dumps (`-ma` for full dumps and `-mp` for mini dumps). These kinds of actions can indicate credential access tactics as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the tactic of Credential Access (T1003.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Utilize Sysmon or Windows Event Logs to examine recent process creation events related to `dump64.exe` in the specified Visual Studio path, noting any unusual parent processes.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line parameters associated with the identified process to determine if they match suspicious patterns like `-ma` or `-mp`, which could indicate an exfiltration or malicious activity.
  - **Cross-Reference with User Activity:** Check the user accounts associated with the process execution through logs to ascertain if the action aligns with legitimate user behavior or administrative tasks in the environment.
  - **Review Sensor Alerts:** Look for any alerts related to .exe files launched from non-standard or unexpected locations in conjunction with relevant antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts for further context.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a high severity level because such activities could indicate a direct attempt to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information through memory dumps, which is a critical security concern in enterprise environments.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes the attacker has the ability to create processes with administrative privileges and can rename tools without being detected. There may be blind spots if similar techniques are used without renaming to `dump64.exe` or if the rule is not adequately tuned for other legitimate uses of ProcDump. Additionally, if the logging mechanism for process creation is not adequately deployed or is misconfigured, this rule may fail to fire.

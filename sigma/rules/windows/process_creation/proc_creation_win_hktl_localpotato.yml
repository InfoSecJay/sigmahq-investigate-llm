  ### Technical Context
  The "HackTool 
  - LocalPotato Execution" detection rule is designed to identify the execution of the LocalPotato proof-of-concept (POC) tool, which is often employed in privilege escalation attacks. This rule works by monitoring the process creation logs in a Windows environment, specifically searching for the execution of any instance of `LocalPotato.exe` along with specific command-line arguments that are commonly used in its execution. It looks for the presence of certain hash values associated with the LocalPotato executable, enhancing its effectiveness in detecting malicious activities tied to this tool. The rule specifically aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, under the tactics of **Defense Evasion** and **Privilege Escalation**, reflecting the nature and purpose of LocalPotato as a tool that can escalate privileges on compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the EDR for events related to the execution of `LocalPotato.exe`, including process parent-child relationships to understand the context around its launch.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Use the command-line monitoring capabilities in your EDR to inspect any instances where `LocalPotato.exe` was executed with the specified arguments to confirm whether malicious intent was present.
  - **Cross-Reference Hash Values:** Investigate any reported matches against known hashes of the LocalPotato executable using file integrity monitoring tools or antivirus solutions to detect any anomalies or potential tampering.
  - **Review Historical Context:** Examine Windows Event Logs (Security and Sysmon) to identify any prior successful or failed privilege escalation attempts that may provide context to the alert and clarify whether the execution is part of an ongoing attack.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the nature of the LocalPotato tool, which can facilitate privilege escalation, potentially compromising sensitive information and system integrity within an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if LocalPotato is executed with atypical command-line parameters or if it is renamed or modified, evading hash checks. Additionally, alerts may be missed if endpoint monitoring tools are not actively logging process creation events, or if necessary permissions aren't in place to capture all relevant activity. The assumption here is that standard security policies are enforced and that the environment has not been previously compromised in a way that would enable stealthy execution of such tools.

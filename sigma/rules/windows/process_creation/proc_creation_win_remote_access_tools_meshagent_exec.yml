title: Remote Access Tool - MeshAgent Command Execution via MeshCentral
id: 74a2b202-73e0-4693-9a3a-9d36146d0775
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the use of MeshAgent to execute commands on the target host, particularly when threat actors might abuse it to execute commands directly.
  MeshAgent can execute commands on the target host by leveraging win-console to obscure their activities and win-dispatcher to run malicious code through IPC with child processes.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies the potential abuse of MeshAgent, a remote access tool, by monitoring process creation events in Windows environments. The detection mechanism specifically looks for instances where `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `pwsh.exe` are invoked as child processes of `meshagent.exe`, suggesting that an adversary might be executing commands on the target host. The use of MeshAgent for remote command execution poses a risk, as it can be leveraged for malicious purposes, especially when operated covertly through the associated `win-console` and `win-dispatcher` modules. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219, which focuses on command and control through external remote services, indicating that this rule serves as an essential monitoring point for detecting unauthorized actions facilitated by remote access tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Utilize the EDR to trace the execution of `meshagent.exe`. Examine the timeline of process creation events leading to any subsequent command execution attempts.
    
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Check the command line parameters of the child processes (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`) for any suspicious or unexpected commands that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Investigate recent network connections from the machine where the alert was triggered, focusing on anomalous external communications that might indicate data exfiltration or command and control activity.
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Utilize task management tools to visualize the process tree associated with `meshagent.exe`. Look for any unusual parent-child relationships that could indicate suspicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified with medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized command execution on compromised systems. If MeshAgent is present but being used for legitimate purposes, further investigation is necessary to rule out false positives.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that `meshagent.exe` is present and actively being used in the environment. It may fail to fire in scenarios where the executables are executed under different parent processes or when adversaries utilize other methods to obfuscate command execution. Additionally, legitimate usage of MeshAgent in organizational workflows may lead to false positives, necessitating careful analysis of context surrounding each alert.

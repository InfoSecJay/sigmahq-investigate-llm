  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential privilege escalation attempts within a Windows environment by monitoring unusual child processes spawned by specific system processes. Specifically, it looks for the creation of child processes initiated by critical Windows components, such as `winlogon.exe`, `services.exe`, and `lsass.exe`, among others. The rule targets child processes that could indicate malicious activities, particularly those involving common command-line interfaces like `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`, when they are executed with specific argument patterns, which suggest network route manipulations (`route ADD`).
  The detection leverages data from process creation events in Windows, specifically monitoring Parent Image and Command Line arguments, making it effective in spotting abnormal behavior indicative of privilege escalation. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of **Privilege Escalation** (T1548), where an attacker may misuse legitimate system processes to gain elevated privileges while executing potentially harmful actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your EDR tool for instances where child processes have been spawned by critical system processes. Pay special attention to the timestamps, Parent Image, and Command Line arguments.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Check the User account associated with the suspicious child process executions. This could provide context on whether an authorized user is involved or if it could potentially be an adversary masquerading as a legitimate user.
  - **Analyze Command Line Usage:** Investigate the Command Line arguments used in the detected processes. Look for patterns consistent with legitimate administrative tasks or if they include malicious commands like `route ADD`, which could indicate attempts to alter network routes.
  - **Cross-reference with Security Tools:** Utilize other security tools, such as AV and logging from any firewalls, to see if similar behavior has been flagged elsewhere in your environment. Investigate any associated network connections made by these processes for further insight.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated by this rule are classified as high severity due to the critical nature of the processes involved and the potential for privilege escalation, which can lead to substantial compromise and lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized issue is that legitimate administrative tasks may sometimes trigger this rule, leading to false positives, especially in environments with frequent system maintenance or updates. Additionally, if the monitored processes are altered or disguised, or if the attackers leverage other means to achieve command execution without the monitored processes, the rule may fail to trigger. It's assumed that standard Windows telemetry is present and functioning correctly; failure in logging configurations could also lead to a lack of detections.

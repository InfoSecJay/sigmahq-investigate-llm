  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of the SharpChisel tool, which is known for its use in command and control (C2) operations, particularly by threat actors. The rule monitors process creation events in a Windows environment, specifically looking for instances where the executed image ends with `SharpChisel.exe`. The significant technical data sources involved are Windows process creation logs, which provide information such as the executable name, command-line parameters, and the associated user context. By focusing on these attributes, the detection aims to flag any unauthorized or suspicious use of SharpChisel that may indicate malicious C2 activity. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Command and Control, specifically technique T1090.001, which pertains to the use of various tools for establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation**: Utilize EDR to examine the process creation logs for the instance of `SharpChisel.exe`, including details such as command-line parameters and the user context in which it was executed.
  - **Inspect Network Connections**: Review network connection logs via NDR to identify any outbound connections established by `SharpChisel.exe`, correlating them with known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  - **Analyze User Behavior**: Use Windows Security logs to assess the behavior of the user who executed SharpChisel, checking for any unauthorized access attempts or unusual activities during the timeframe of the alert.
  - **Conduct Threat Intelligence Lookup**: Search for the hash of the `SharpChisel.exe` file in AV and threat intelligence platforms to confirm if it has been flagged as malicious in other environments or reports.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized command and control activities, which could lead to significant data breaches or compromise of sensitive systems within the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not detect legitimate use cases of SharpChisel in environments where it is used for testing or administrative purposes. Additionally, the rule relies on accurate process creation logs, which may not capture instances where the tool is executed with elevated privileges or in a stealthy manner, such as through script obfuscation or file renaming. Analysts should be aware that advanced adversaries may use evasion techniques to disguise their activities, potentially bypassing detection.

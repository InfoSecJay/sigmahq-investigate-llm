  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed BrowserCore.EXE Execution" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious process creation events that involve a renamed instance of `BrowserCore.exe`, a legitimate executable associated with extracting Azure tokens. Attackers may rename this executable to hide their activities when leveraging Azure services, which gives this alert a high severity level. The rule primarily monitors process creation logs within the Windows operating system, looking for instances where the file's original filename is `BrowserCore.exe`, while also checking that the image path ends with `BrowserCore.exe`. This approach enables the identification of potential misuse of a known application as an attack vector, thereby serving the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1528 (User Execution) and T1036.003 (Masquerading: Rename System Utilities). Analysts and incident responders can use this rule to quickly flag suspicious process creations that may warrant further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Origin:** Investigate the originating source and hash of the detected `BrowserCore.exe` process using the EDR tool to confirm whether it matches any known valid applications. 
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters:** Analyze the command-line arguments associated with the process creation event for any suspicious activity that could indicate exploitation or unauthorized access patterns.
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Determine the parent process that initiated `BrowserCore.exe` to understand its context and identify if any lateral movement may have occurred or if it was executed by a legitimate software suite.
  - **Access Related Network Activity:** Utilize network connection logs to identify any communication from the detected process to external IP addresses, which may signal potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the nature of the activity it detects; `BrowserCore.exe` is commonly associated with Azure token extraction, meaning an unauthorized execution could indicate active threat engagement or compromise within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where the `BrowserCore.exe` executable remains in its original name or is executed in a manner that does not utilize process creation logs, such as direct execution from memory or through obfuscation techniques that minimize visibility. There may be instances where external tools or scripts could be used to execute commands that do not capture the intended process details, leading to potential gaps in detection. Analysts should be aware that legitimate updates or software installations may also trigger this alert under certain circumstances.

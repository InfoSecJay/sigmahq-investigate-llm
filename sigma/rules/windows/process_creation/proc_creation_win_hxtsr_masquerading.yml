title: Potential Fake Instance Of Hxtsr.EXE Executed
id: 4e762605-34a8-406d-b72e-c1a089313320
status: test
description: |
  HxTsr.exe is a Microsoft compressed executable file called Microsoft Outlook Communications.
  HxTsr.exe is part of Outlook apps, because it resides in a hidden "WindowsApps" subfolder of "C:\Program Files".
  Any instances of hxtsr.exe not in this folder may be malware camouflaging itself as HxTsr.exe

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify instances of `HxTsr.exe`, a Microsoft executable associated with Outlook Communications, that are executed from unauthorized locations outside of its legitimate directory (`C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsCommunicationsApps_*`). The rule observes process creation logs to capture any executions of `HxTsr.exe` that may occur from files not residing in the approved folder, signaling the potential presence of a malicious actor attempting to camouflage malware as a legitimate application. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of defense evasion (T1036), as adversaries may utilize techniques to hide malicious activities from security monitoring systems by masquerading as trusted software.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin**: Use EDR tools to check the execution path of `HxTsr.exe`. Confirm whether the file resides within the `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\` directory to rule out legitimate instances.
  - **Check File Integrity**: Look for the file hash of the detected `HxTsr.exe`. Compare it with known hashes from reputable sources to determine if it's an authorized Microsoft version or possibly a malicious variant.
  - **Review Parent Process Information**: Investigate the parent process and command-line arguments associated with the execution of `HxTsr.exe`. Look for unusual patterns or commands that could indicate an attempt to exploit the legitimate process.
  - **Monitor for Additional Indicators**: Utilize Sysmon and other logs to identify any related activities (network connections, registry changes, etc.) linked to the suspicious instance of `HxTsr.exe`. This will help determine whether this is part of a larger malicious campaign.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity as it indicates a potential attempt to evade detection using a legitimate filename, which could serve as an entry point for additional malicious activities. Response teams should prioritize it for investigation due to the implications of impersonation of trusted executables.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if the malicious executable is appropriately named to deceive system processes, or if it remains in a legitimate directory but is modified. Additionally, the rule assumes that processes are being monitored for their execution. Adversaries might take action to disable logging or remove indicators of execution to bypass detection entirely, limiting the effectiveness of the rule.

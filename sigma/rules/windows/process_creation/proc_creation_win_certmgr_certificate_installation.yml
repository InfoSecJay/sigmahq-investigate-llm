  Detects execution of "certmgr" with the "add" flag in order to install a new certificate on the system.
  Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "New Root Certificate Installed Via CertMgr.EXE" aims to identify instances where a root certificate is added to a Windows system using the `certmgr.exe` utility. This can be a significant security concern, as malicious actors may exploit this capability to install rogue certificates, facilitating man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks or other forms of evasion. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where `CertMgr.exe` is executed with the `/add` flag, an indication of an attempt to import a new root certificate, and checks the command line for the presence of 'root'. 
  The primary data sources involved in this detection include Windows Event Logs, specifically from process creation telemetry, which captures the execution of processes and their associated command-line arguments. This type of behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1553.004, which deals with the installation of malicious root certificates for evading security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR tool for instances of `CertMgr.exe` being executed in the timeframe of the alert. Look for suspicious command line arguments, such as `/add` with a focus on newly created root certificates.
    
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Investigate the full command line used with `CertMgr.exe`, including any file paths or certificate names provided. Ensure that these certificates are legitimate and come from a trusted source.
  - **Inspect Certificate Store:** Utilize Windows certificate management tools to inspect the certificate store on the affected system. Look for any newly added root certificates and evaluate their issuer and properties for legitimacy.
  - **Cross-check with Helpdesk Requests:** If any new root certificates were indeed installed, cross-check these against IT service request logs. Confirm whether there was an approved request for the installation to mitigate false positives.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered medium due to the potential impact of unauthorized root certificate installations, which can lead to significant security vulnerabilities. Immediate investigation is warranted to ensure that no malicious activity is happening within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `CertMgr.exe` is used with only standard flags (not `/add`) or if alternative utilities are used for certificate management. The rule assumes that process creation logs are enabled and that there are no filtering mechanisms preventing the logging of `certmgr.exe` usage. Additionally, it is important to consider that legitimate administrative activities, such as Help Desk personnel adding corporate Root CAs, could result in false positives if not properly validated.

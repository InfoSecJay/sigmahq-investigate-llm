  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential persistence mechanisms employed by adversaries through the manipulation of the Windows registry, specifically targeting the "UserInitMprLogonScript" value. The rule works by monitoring process creation logs for command-line arguments that contain the string "UserInitMprLogonScript." This is significant because modifications to this registry key can allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts each time a user logs in, thus ensuring their code runs persistently. The primary data sources involved in this detection are Windows Security Event Logs, particularly focusing on creating commands and their parameters. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1037.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder: Logon Script), which highlights this specific tactic of establishing persistence through registry manipulation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your EDR solution for entries matching the detection criteria, particularly focusing on the time of execution and originating user accounts.
    
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Utilize Windows Security logs to verify if the logged user associated with the suspicious command line was performing legitimate administrative duties at the time of the event.
  - **Inspect Registry Changes:** Check the Windows registry for any modifications at the key path relevant to "UserInitMprLogonScript," noting the time and context of these changes to ascertain if they align with known maintenance activities or represent potential exploitation.
  - **Analyze User Logon Events:** Evaluate the logon events that correspond with the suspicious registry modification to determine whether any unusual behavior occurred during these sessions, including the execution of unauthorized scripts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because the modification of logon scripts may indicate an attempt by an adversary to establish persistence on a compromised host, potentially leading to further exploitation and lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where registry modifications are performed in ways that do not trigger process creation logs, such as through direct registry editing without related command execution. Additionally, legitimate actions by administrators or third-party tools may lead to false positives, as the detection does not discriminate between authorized and unauthorized changes. It is assumed that environments have proper logging enabled; if not, this rule may not provide complete visibility.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potentially Suspicious Ping/Copy Command Combination" is designed to identify potentially malicious behavior within a Windows environment. Specifically, it focuses on the execution of command-line instructions that include both "ping" and "copy" commands being run from `cmd.exe`. This command combination has been observed in various malware activities where attackers may use them to verify network connectivity while simultaneously exfiltrating data or copying files to an unauthorized location. The rule leverages process creation logs, particularly the command-line parameters, to discern these actions. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** and technique **T1070.004**, which concerns the presence of artifacts that might be used to obfuscate malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Command Execution**: Use EDR tools to track the process execution details for `cmd.exe`, ensuring to capture the command-line arguments that triggered the alert. Cross-reference these with the timestamp of the alert for correlation.
  - **Analyze Network Activity**: Review network logs (NDR) for any unusual traffic patterns or connections initiated by the host that executed the command, paying special attention to the external IP addresses contacted during this time.
  - **Check File Operations**: Utilize file monitoring logs or alerts from AV solutions to see if any unauthorized files were created, modified, or deleted in conjunction with the command execution.
  - **Review User Context**: Examine user activity logs to ensure that the commands were executed by a legitimate user or system account, checking for possible account compromise or unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because the combination of "ping" and "copy" can indicate an attempt to mask malicious behavior, which may lead to data exfiltration or reconnaissance by an attacker. Although it may also arise from legitimate administrative actions, the potential risks warrant further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the volume of legitimate usage of the ping and copy commands is high, or if there are environmental factors that mask these commands being executed through alternate methods or tools. Additionally, if an attacker uses obfuscation techniques to alter the command structure or utilize different processes to execute similar commands, the detection may fail. Analysts should be aware that legitimate applications or scripts that use these commands for benign functions may lead to false positives.

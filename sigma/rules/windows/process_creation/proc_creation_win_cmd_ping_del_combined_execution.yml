title: Suspicious Ping/Del Command Combination
id: 54786ddc-5b8a-11ed-9b6a-0242ac120002
status: test
description: Detects a method often used by ransomware. Which combines the "ping"
  to wait a couple of seconds and then "del" to delete the file in question. Its used
  to hide the file responsible for the initial infection for example

  ### Technical Context
  The “Suspicious Ping/Del Command Combination” detection rule targets a common tactic used by ransomware to obfuscate malicious activities. By utilizing the command-line interface, the rule detects instances where a "ping" command is issued in conjunction with a "del" command, specifically looking for commands that involve waiting for a couple of seconds before deleting a file. The `ping` command introduces a delay, allowing a malicious actor to cover their tracks by deleting the file responsible for the infection immediately afterward. The log sources utilized for this detection are primarily Windows process creation logs, particularly focusing on command-line parameters which indicate the execution of the ping and delete operations. The rule addresses the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1070.004), which relates to techniques used by adversaries to obscure their presence and prevent detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Command-Line Activity:** Evaluate the process creation logs on the affected system to identify any executed commands containing 'ping' and 'del' as specified in the alert. 
  - **Analyze Associated Processes:** Utilize EDR to trace back any related processes that initiated the ping and del commands, checking for unusual parent-child relationships or subsequent file modifications.
  - **Check System and Application Logs:** Investigate Windows Security, System, and Application logs for any instances of file anomalies or security events that coincide with the timing of the detected commands.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Look for outbound connections or unusual network behavior during the same time frame when the command was executed, which may indicate data exfiltration or further command-and-control traffic.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it indicates that the detection rule targets potentially malicious actions indicative of ransomware behavior, warranting immediate investigation to prevent data loss or further compromise within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection approach may fail to fire if the command is obfuscated or executed via non-standard methods, such as through PowerShell or scripting languages that are not captured in traditional process creation logs. Additionally, if an attacker utilizes benign-looking commands and disguises their true intention, it can evade detection. Assumptions include the expectation that logs are being retained adequately and that historical command-line data is available for thorough analysis.

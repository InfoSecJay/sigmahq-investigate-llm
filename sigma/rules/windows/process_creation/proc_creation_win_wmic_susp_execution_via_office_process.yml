description: Office application called wmic to proxye execution through a LOLBIN process.
  This is often used to break suspicious parent-child chain (Office app spawns LOLBin).

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious WMIC Execution Via Office Process" is designed to detect potentially malicious behavior involving Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) execution launched through legitimate Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Adversaries often exploit these trusted processes to invoke WMIC for malicious purposes, circumventing traditional security controls and breaking the parent-child relationship of executable processes. The rule checks for specific parent processes representing common Office applications and looks for associated WMIC commands that include suspicious parameters or additional command-line interactions indicative of further exploitation tactics. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques ID T1204.002 (User Execution) and T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation).
  The detection mechanism leverages Windows Event Logs focusing primarily on `process_creation` events. The key attributes of interest are the parent process's image (e.g., Word or Excel) and the characteristics of the child WMIC process, including the command line's contents. Failure to capture this data could hinder detection efforts if an adversary employs alternate methods or tools outside the defined parameters.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Tree Analysis**: Use EDR tools to trace the entire process chain, starting from the Office application and following to WMIC.exe, reviewing any unusual child processes spawned during the execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Inspect the command-line arguments used with WMIC for suspicious keywords such as 'create' and 'call', as well as any references to other LOLBINs like `regsvr32` or `mshta`.
  - **Review Security Logs for Anomalous Behavior**: Examine Windows Security logs surrounding the incident time, looking for any abnormal authentication patterns or access attempts made by the involved processes.
  - **Assess Network Connections**: Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to verify outbound connections initiated by WMIC or related processes, checking for any unusual endpoints or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert can indicate an adversary leveraging trusted applications to perform unauthorized actions, it is deemed high severity. Immediate investigation is warranted, as it signals potential compromise that could lead to further exploitation or data loss.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious actions occur through non-standard Office applications or if processes like WMIC are invoked using alternative syntaxes or by means that do not divulge their activities in standard logs. Additionally, an adversary could obfuscate their execution by manipulating logging behaviors or using other LOLBINs not explicitly listed in the rule's detection criteria. It is essential for detection engineers to regularly update and refine the rule to capture emerging tactics.

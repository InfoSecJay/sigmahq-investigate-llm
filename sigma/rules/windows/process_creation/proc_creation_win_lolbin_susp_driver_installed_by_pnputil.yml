  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for potentially suspicious installations of drivers on Windows systems utilizing `pnputil.exe`, a built-in utility for managing driver packages. The rule specifically looks for command-line arguments that indicate the installation or addition of a driver, such as `-i`, `/install`, `-a`, and `/add-driver`, especially when the command is executed from the `pnputil.exe` executable. When this rule is triggered, it may indicate a persistence mechanism (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547), where an adversary tries to load malicious drivers to maintain unauthorized control over the system. The primary data sources involved in this detection are process creation logs which capture the execution of commands and their parameters, along with parent process information, to contextualize the activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze the process creation logs for entries related to `pnputil.exe` and examine the associated command-line parameters for any suspicious activities.
    
  - **Cross-check User Identity:** Verify the user account initiates the `pnputil.exe` command. Check if the user is known in your environment to execute such commands or part of an administrative role.
  - **Examine Parent Process Details:** Investigate the parent command line of the `pnputil.exe` execution to determine the context from which it was launched. This helps assess if it's a legitimate administrative task or potentially malicious.
  - **Correlate with Network and EDR Insights:** Review network logs and EDR alerts around the same time to check for abnormal connections or behaviors that could align with malicious intentions, linking them to the driver installation activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the inherent risks associated with driver installations in a Windows environment. Unauthorized or suspicious driver installations can lead to persistence mechanisms being established by an attacker, potentially allowing for further exploitation or control of the affected system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes `pnputil.exe` is not being executed by legitimate processes outside of known administrative functions; therefore, high-privilege users may generate false positives if they are engaging in routine operations. Additionally, if an attacker executes `pnputil.exe` using a different method (e.g., as a child process of a non-obvious parent), the rule may fail to detect it. Furthermore, the environment must capture all relevant process creation logs for comprehensive monitoring; otherwise, the detection may miss critical events.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Bypass UAC via CMSTP" is designed to detect potentially malicious usage of the Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (cmstp.exe). This executable is frequently exploited by adversaries to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and escalate privileges on a Windows system. The rule specifically looks for instances where cmstp.exe is executed with command-line arguments typically associated with installing specially formatted .INF files, which could indicate an attempt to install unauthorized configurations. The detection leverages process creation logs, where the characteristics of the executable, as well as the command-line parameters used during execution, are monitored to identify such activities. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactics of privilege escalation (T1548.002) and defense evasion (T1218.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:** Use the EDR solution to investigate any instances of cmstp.exe execution, scrutinizing the process tree for any parent processes that may indicate how the utility was invoked.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line arguments associated with cmstp.exe executions to confirm if they include flags such as `/s`, `-s`, `/au`, or `/ni`, which are common in privilege escalation attempts.
  - **Search Windows Event Logs:** Inspect Windows Security and System logs for any related events around the time of the cmstp.exe executions to see if there are any unusual login activities or changes to user privileges.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Check the network connection logs (NDR) to identify any outbound connections made around the same time as the suspicious cmstp.exe executions, potentially indicating remote control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule should be considered high severity due to the nature of potential privilege escalation attempts, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if cmstp.exe is used legitimately by authorized users, as it can be a common utility for configuration management. Additionally, if an attacker employs obfuscation techniques to alter the command-line arguments or utilize alternative methods to invoke the executable, the detection may fail. It is also assumed that the logging levels of the monitored systems are set appropriately to capture the necessary telemetry data for effective detection.

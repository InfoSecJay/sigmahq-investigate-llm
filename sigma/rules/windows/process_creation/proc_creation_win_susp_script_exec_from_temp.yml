  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potentially malicious script executions originating from temporary directories, which are often used by attackers to evade detection by storing malicious files in less monitored locations. The rule specifically looks for the execution of scripting engines, such as PowerShell, MSHTA, WScript, or CScript, that are invoked from common temporary folder paths. These include standard Windows locations like `C:\Windows\Temp`, `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp`, and various other temporary directories referenced by environment variables. The use of command-line parameters that indicate suspicious behaviors—e.g., redirection to output files, attempts to run with elevated privileges (using `-WindowStyle hidden -Verb runAs`), or command patterns that mask the nature of the executed code—is also monitored. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic of Execution, particularly Technique T1059 (Scripting).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Activity:** Check relevant EDR logs for the specific script execution event to understand the context, including the user, time, and source of execution.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters associated with the detected process to identify any potentially harmful intentions, such as redirection to output files or attempts to run with elevated privileges.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize network detection tools to monitor any outbound network connections made by the script during execution, examining for suspicious traffic that may indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
  - **Examine Temporary File Artifacts:** Investigate temporary directories and any associated files that were created or modified around the time of the suspicious execution, looking for additional scripts or binaries that may indicate a more extensive compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high potential for abuse, the severity level of this alert is marked as high. Scripts executed from temporary folders can often indicate an attacker’s attempt to evade monitoring and perform malicious actions on a system, warranting prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if malicious scripts are executed from locations outside the specified temporary paths or if they utilize non-standard execution methods that don’t show up in typical process creation logs. Additionally, benign administrative scripts could trigger false positives, necessitating further review to differentiate between legitimate and suspicious activity. Adversaries may also modify their techniques to avoid detection by employing less common scripting engines or executing scripts directly from memory.

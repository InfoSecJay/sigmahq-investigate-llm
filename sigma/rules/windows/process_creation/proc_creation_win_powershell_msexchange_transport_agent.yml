  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "MSExchange Transport Agent Installation" is designed to detect unauthorized installations of Exchange Transport Agents on Windows servers running Microsoft Exchange. The rule focuses specifically on command-line activity, searching for instances where the command `Install-TransportAgent` is used, which is a PowerShell command associated with the installation of Transport Agents. The detection leverages data from Windows Event Logs related to process creation, particularly Sysmon logs, capturing details such as command-line parameters and process paths. 
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Persistence" and the specific technique "T1505.002," which pertains to the installation of components that enable an attacker to maintain a foothold within a system. The relevance of this detection comes from its ability to identify potentially malicious or unauthorized attempts to establish persistence through Exchange Transport Agents.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check your EDR solution for process creation logs that include the use of the `Install-TransportAgent` command. Pay particular attention to the context in which the command was executed, such as the user account and originating process.
    
  - **Examine Assembly Path:** Investigate the `AssemblyPath` field from the detected logs to discern if the path corresponds to known legitimate software. Cross-reference with expected paths for legitimate Transport Agents.
  - **Correlate with Proxy Logs:** Look for associated outgoing connections in the proxy logs at the time of detection. Determine if there were any abnormal or unauthorized requests including potentially malicious data exfiltration.
  - **Analyze Windows Security Logs:** Search for any recent changes in user permissions or other relevant changes in the Windows Security Logs following the detection. Investigate if any privileged accounts might have been used inappropriately.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified with a medium severity level due to the potential risk of an unauthorized component being installed, which could lead to persistent backdoors or unauthorized access within the Exchange environment. Prompt investigation is essential as these installations may provide lasting control to an adversary.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where the installation is executed using legitimate administrative accounts during routine updates, resulting in false positives. Additionally, it assumes that the logging level is sufficiently set up to record detailed command-line executions. An adversary may also attempt to obfuscate their activity by using alternate methods or command parameters, which would evade detection by this rule.

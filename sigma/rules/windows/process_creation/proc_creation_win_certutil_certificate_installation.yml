  Detects execution of "certutil" with the "addstore" flag in order to install a new certificate on the system.
  Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for "New Root Certificate Installed Via Certutil.EXE" aims to identify the execution of the `certutil.exe` utility with the `-addstore` flag, which is used for adding certificates to the Windows certificate store. This behavior is particularly noteworthy as adversaries may utilize it to install unauthorized root certificates, allowing them to create trust in malicious web servers, thereby hijacking encrypted communications without raising security alarms. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs to monitor execution patterns of `certutil.exe`, focusing on command-line parameters that specify the command to add root certificates. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically technique T1553.004, which relates to the abuse of trusted utilities to evade detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Context:** Examine the execution context of `certutil.exe` in your EDR solution to verify the user account that executed the command and validate whether it aligns with expected usage patterns.
  - **Review Related Events:** Utilize Sysmon logs to analyze any process creation events that occurred in conjunction with the `certutil.exe` execution, looking for other suspicious activities or chains of events leading to this action.
  - **Inspect Certificate Store:** Access the Windows certificate store to identify any newly added root certificates and determine their origin, ensuring they conform to corporate policy and are not malicious in nature.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Use network detection tools to review any outbound connections made by the device following the installation of the new root certificate, as they could indicate potential communication with adversary-controlled servers.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for this alert to indicate malicious activity involving the installation of rogue trusted certificates, alerts should be treated with a medium severity level in enterprise environments. Prompt investigation is warranted to mitigate risks to secure communications and data integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where `certutil.exe` is executed without the `-addstore` and `root` flags, as the detection is explicitly tailored for those conditions. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions by Help Desk or IT personnel that involve adding corporate root certificates may lead to false positives. It's assumed that logging is consistently configured across systems; otherwise, there might be gaps where the execution of `certutil.exe` does not get captured.

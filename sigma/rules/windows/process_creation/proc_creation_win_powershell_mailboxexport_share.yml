  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious use of the PowerShell cmdlet `New-MailboxExportRequest`, which is employed for exporting mailboxes to a specified file path, particularly in environments running Microsoft Exchange. The rule aims to detect instances where this cmdlet is executed with arguments that suggest the mailbox data is being exported to an unexpected remote or local share. Such behavior is particularly concerning as it may be indicative of data exfiltration attempts exploiting vulnerabilities, such as those seen in the ProxyShell exploitation. The primary data sources monitored for this rule include process creation logs from Windows, where specific command-line arguments are analyzed to trigger alerts. The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of exfiltration (ATT&CK ID: T1041), highlighting the potential risk of data leakage from compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Related Activity:** Investigate the endpoint using EDR tools to examine if the export command was executed from a known or anomalous user account, looking for any prior suspicious activities associated with that account.
  - **Review PowerShell Logs:** Analyze PowerShell operational logs to trace the full context around the execution of the `New-MailboxExportRequest`, including related commands leading up to it and the userâ€™s intent.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Utilize network logs to assess for any unusual data flows or connections to external shares or servers at the time of the detected activity, which might suggest data exfiltration.
  - **Examine Exchange Server Logs:** Consult Exchange server logs to confirm if the mailbox export was legitimate, checking for any abnormal actions or patterns surrounding the event that could indicate unauthorized access or exploitation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered critical due to the high potential impact of data theft or compromise of sensitive information within an organization's email system. Quick action is required to limit exposure and validate the legitimacy of the mailbox export request.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire in scenarios where the command is executed without the specified arguments, or if the malicious action leverages alternate methods to exfiltrate data that do not involve the `New-MailboxExportRequest` cmdlet. Additionally, if an attacker has the ability to modify or mask command-line arguments, it may evade detection. Organizations must ensure that PowerShell logging is adequately configured and monitored to capture such activity effectively.

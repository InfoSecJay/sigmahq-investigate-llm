  Detects execution and usage of the DSInternals PowerShell module. Which can be used to perform what might be considered as suspicious activity such as dumping DPAPI backup keys or manipulating NTDS.DIT files.
  The DSInternals PowerShell Module exposes several internal features of Active Directory and Azure Active Directory. These include FIDO2 and NGC key auditing, offline ntds.dit file manipulation, password auditing, DC recovery from IFM backups and password hash calculation.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "DSInternals Suspicious PowerShell Cmdlets" is designed to detect the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands associated with the DSInternals module. This module allows for advanced interactions with Active Directory (AD) and Azure Active Directory (AAD), such as manipulating essential security features, dumping backup keys, and auditing passwords. The rule focuses on identifying specific command-line parameters that may indicate abuse of the DSInternals capabilities, especially in contexts that could involve attacks on credential security or unauthorized access to sensitive data. The technical data sources for this rule primarily include process creation logs that capture details about PowerShell command executions, specifically using parameters common to DSInternals functionalities. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Execution" and technique T1059.001 (PowerShell).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Investigate any alerts in the EDR that correlate with the detected use of DSInternals PowerShell cmdlets, focusing on the source process and user context.
  - **Examine Command-Line Usage**: Analyze the command-line arguments presented at the time of process creation, specifically targeting the strings defined in the Sigma rule to confirm if they match the suspicious activity.
  - **Query Security Logs**: Use Windows Security Event Logs to track any authentication attempts or changes to sensitive accounts that may coincide with the execution of the DSInternals commands for further correlation.
  - **Check for Legitimate Use**: Determine if the detected activity is part of legitimate administrative actions by consulting change management logs or interviewing the involved user for context.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert fired by this rule is categorized as high severity, given that the execution of DSInternals commands is often associated with activities that can compromise security, such as password dumping or unauthorized changes to Active Directory configurations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where the DSInternals module is used legitimately for administrative purposes; as such, it assumes that administrators follow proper protocols and won't perform tasks out of the ordinary without standard logging. Additionally, the rule may fail to detect obfuscated command-line executions or alternative methods of executing PowerShell commands, such as through scheduled tasks or other scripting methods not captured in the command line.

While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit specific environment and operational needs.

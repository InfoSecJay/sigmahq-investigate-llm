  ### Technical Context
  The "Procdump Execution" detection rule focuses on identifying the execution of the SysInternals tool Procdump, commonly used for dumping process memory, capturing crash dumps, and performing forensic analysis. The rule looks for instances where the image name of the executed process ends with "procdump.exe" or "procdump64.exe," indicating potential misuses, such as data exfiltration or adversary evasion tactics. Technical data sources utilized in this detection include Windows process creation logs captured by Sysmon, which provide detailed records of process execution, including command-line parameters and associated user context. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (Tactic: T1070) and Credential Dumping (Technique: T1003.001), as adversaries may leverage Procdump to access sensitive information stealthily.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Executing User's Credentials:** Check the account that executed Procdump in the EDR or Windows Security logs to determine if it belongs to a legitimate user or if it raises suspicion based on account activity patterns.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line parameters used during the execution of Procdump from the process creation logs to identify any signs of malicious intent, such as targeting sensitive processes or unusual output paths.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference the event with additional telemetry sources, such as antivirus, EDR, and network logs, to observe any anomalous behaviour or related alerts that may indicate malicious activities in conjunction with Procdump execution.
  - **Assess the Context of Execution:** Investigate the surrounding context in which Procdump was executed by reviewing historical activity from the originating machine and user account, enabling identification of potential lateral movement or persistence strategies employed.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert for Procdump execution is assigned a medium severity level because while Procdump can be used legitimately by developers or security teams for troubleshooting, its use could signify malicious intent in the wrong contextâ€”particularly when associated with suspicious user activity or process targeting.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in certain environments where Procdump is not installed, or be silently defeated if legitimate users misuse the tool. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries may rename or obfuscate Procdump to bypass detection, as the rule relies specifically on the file names. It is assumed that all instances of Procdump will be tracked effectively; however, there is a risk that execution paths different from the defined search criteria may evade detection.

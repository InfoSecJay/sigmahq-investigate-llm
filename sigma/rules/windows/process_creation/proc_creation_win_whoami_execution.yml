  ### Technical Context
  The "Whoami Utility Execution" detection rule is designed to identify instances where the Windows command-line utility `whoami.exe` is executed on a system. This utility is frequently utilized by attackers post-exploitation to gather information about the current user context, which can assist in further privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network. The rule targets the `process_creation` logs, specifically looking for the execution of the `whoami.exe` executable. By analyzing the `Image` path and confirming the `OriginalFileName`, the detection logic helps ensure that the execution detected is indeed the intended utility and not a benign script or tool used by administrators. This alert correlates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery), emphasizing the strategic importance of monitoring for potential misuse of this seemingly innocuous command.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate the Context of Execution:** Check the context in which `whoami.exe` was executed using EDR logs. Determine if it correlates with any known administrative tasks or user activity that would justify this command.
  - **Correlate with User Activity Logs:** Examine Windows Security Event Logs to identify user login sessions and correlate the timing of `whoami.exe` execution with authenticated sessions to identify potential unauthorized usage.
  - **Inspect Related Processes:** Utilize EDR tools to review processes that were spawned around the same time as the execution of `whoami.exe`. Look for other suspicious or unusual process activities that may indicate a compromise.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Check proxy logs and network connection logs for outbound communication that may correlate with the execution event, which could indicate attempts to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as low severity primarily because `whoami.exe` is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks. However, its usage in combination with other suspicious indicators may warrant elevated scrutiny.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where `whoami.exe` is frequently used for legitimate administrative purposes, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, attackers may employ tactics to mask their actions, such as renaming the executable or using alternative methods for user enumeration. Organizations should assume that sophisticated adversaries may bypass detection by utilizing scripts that do not invoke `whoami.exe` directly or by utilizing tools that perform similar functions without being flagged.

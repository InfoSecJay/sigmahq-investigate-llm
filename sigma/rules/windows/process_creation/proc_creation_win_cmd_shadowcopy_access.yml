  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify instances where the Windows command-line utility `cmd.exe` is being used to execute the `copy` command specifically targeting Volume Shadow Copies. The command typically follows a syntax that includes the `\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy` notation. Adversaries often employ this technique to access and duplicate files, like registry hives, that are otherwise locked during normal operations. By monitoring the command line of process creations for this specific pattern, the rule aims to highlight potential illicit attempts to extract sensitive data from a system.
  This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of **Impact** and technique **T1490: Infiltration of System Files or Configuration**. The primary data sources used by the rule include process creation logs, which detail command-line parameters and executed processes, allowing for precise detection of suspicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the logs from your EDR or Sysmon for the detected command execution to gather additional context about the user, time, and any associated processes.
  - **Analyze the Command Line:** Inspect the specific command line arguments used in the execution. Look for indications that suggest misuse or malicious intent, such as unusual paths or file targets.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Utilize network connection logs and Windows security logs to determine if there was any data exfiltration or unusual access patterns leading up to the command execution.
  - **Identify False Positives:** Confirm whether the command execution corresponds to legitimate use cases, such as backup or recovery processes, to rule out benign activity, referencing enterprise backup policies.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level of this alert is justified in an enterprise environment, as the misuse of shadow copies to extract sensitive information poses a significant threat to data integrity and confidentiality. Prompt investigation is essential to mitigate potential data breaches or system compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the command execution is obfuscated, altered, or if an adversary uses alternative methods to access Volume Shadow Copies. Additionally, legitimate backup operations able to access these files without triggering alerts may result in false negatives. Engineers should consider that sophisticated threats might employ alternate techniques or exit points that fall outside the intended detection scope.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the command-line utility `cmd.EXE`, specifically when it uses the built-in "copy" command to access Windows Volume Shadow Copies. The purpose of this activity is often nefarious, as threat actors may leverage these shadow copies to extract live copies of locked files, such as registry hives, potentially aiding in data exfiltration or lateral movement. The rule targets specific command-line patternsâ€”executions that include 'copy' and reference shadow copies using the special path prefix `\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy`. The primary data sources for detection are Windows process creation logs, which capture command-line inputs accompanying process startups.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution to identify any instances of `cmd.EXE` executing the detected command. Pay special attention to timestamps and associated user IDs to assess if the execution aligns with normal user activity.
  - Cross-reference the command-line activity with relevant user accounts in your Active Directory or authentication logs to determine if the command was executed by a legitimate user or a potentially compromised account.
  - Utilize your SIEM to correlate any abnormal patterns or anomalies surrounding the timestamps of the activity, such as unusual inbound or outbound network traffic.
  - Investigate any script or task scheduling entries that may correspond to the detected command, as these could indicate automated execution which might warrant deeper scrutiny into automation frameworks (e.g., PowerShell scripts).

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "HackTool 
  - F-Secure C3 Load by Rundll32" is designed to detect malicious activity leveraging the `rundll32.exe` process, specifically targeting the execution of a DLL containing the `StartNodeRelay` function, which is associated with the F-Secure C3 tool. This detection rule monitors process creation events for command-line parameters containing all three terms: `rundll32.exe`, `.dll`, and `StartNodeRelay`. This combination may indicate an attempt to utilize the vulnerabilities of the `rundll32.exe` utility for the purpose of executing potentially harmful payloads or malicious operations, thus falling under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics related to defense evasion (T1218.011). The primary technical data sources involved in this rule are process creation logs, specifically focusing on the command-line parameters, to identify suspicious usage patterns that can be indicative of an attack or exploitation attempt.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Detected Process:** Check the process details in your EDR tool for the `rundll32.exe` instance and confirm the command-line parameters used. Investigate the parent process to see how it was spawned and whether any prior suspicious activities occurred.
    
  - **Analyze Loaded Modules:** Use Sysmon logs to enumerate DLLs loaded by the detected `rundll32.exe` process. Look for unexpected or unverified DLLs that may suggest malicious intent.
  - **Cross-reference with Threat Intelligence:** Compare the hashes of the detected DLLs against threat intelligence databases and internal blocklists. This helps to identify known malicious DLLs associated with F-Secure C3 or similar tools.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Examine network traffic logs from your NDR or firewall to identify unusual outbound connections or data transfers associated with the suspicious process. Investigate any connections that do not conform to standard operational behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as critical due to the potential severity of the payload being executed through a trusted Windows utility, `rundll32.exe`, which could indicate a serious compromise or infiltration attempt that may lead to further breaches in the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `rundll32.exe` process is invoked without the specific parameters defined in the detection logic or if benign processes are misidentified as malicious. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries might employ obfuscation techniques or modify command-line parameters to evade detection. The assumption that the command-line structure remains consistent may also fail if attackers change their approach. It's critical for detection engineers to recognize these areas to improve and adapt rules as threats evolve.

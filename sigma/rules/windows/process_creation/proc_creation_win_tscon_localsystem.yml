  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious TSCON Start as SYSTEM" detects instances where the `tscon.exe` process is started under the Local System account. This behavior is considered anomalous, as `tscon.exe`, a utility for connecting to Remote Desktop sessions, should typically run under a user context rather than with elevated system privileges. The rule leverages process creation logs to identify when the `tscon.exe` executable is initiated by the Local System, specifically looking for the string 'AUTHORI' or 'AUTORI' in the User field to account for different language settings. This alert correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219, which involves RDP Hijacking as part of command and control operations, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to remote sessions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Context:** Use EDR tools to determine if `tscon.exe` was executed from a legitimate source or if it appears to be an unauthorized invocation. Pay special attention to the associated process tree.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Investigate the User Logon events in Windows Security logs to establish whether the Local System initiated the process in question and if there are any preceding suspicious activities.
  - **Monitor Network Connections:** Analyze network logs to identify any unusual outbound connections made immediately following the execution of `tscon.exe`. This could unveil potential data exfiltration or command and control communications.
  - **Evaluate Privilege Escalation Attempts:** Check for other associated alerts or behaviors that might suggest attempts for privilege escalation or lateral movement in conjunction with this alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity because the unintended use of `tscon.exe` by the Local System account could indicate an ongoing attack that compromises the integrity of remote desktop sessions. Immediate response is necessary to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `tscon.exe` is run in legitimate user contexts, or if the process is obfuscated or renamed to avoid detection. Additionally, if an adversary uses other tools or methods to escalate privileges or hijack sessions without invoking `tscon.exe`, this will also evade detection. Analysts should ensure the process creation logging is correctly configured and that the monitoring solution captures all necessary telemetry to enable comprehensive detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Veeam Backup Database Suspicious Query" is designed to identify potentially malicious activity targeting Veeam backup databases through SQL queries executed via `sqlcmd.exe`. This rule focuses on processes created with the command line parameters that include references to Veeam backup repositories and credentials, indicating possible data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. The rule utilizes process creation logs to evaluate the execution of `sqlcmd.exe`, particularly looking for command line arguments that suggest suspicious queries associated with backup operations.
  By monitoring the command-line arguments fed into the process, the detection mechanism is able to pinpoint queries that involve sensitive terms such as 'BackupRepositories', 'Credentials', or 'SmbFileShares'. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Collection (T1005), highlighting the risk of attackers trying to gather sensitive backup information which could facilitate further attacks or lead to data breaches.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Process Creation Events:** Use EDR tools to examine recent `sqlcmd.exe` process creation events to identify the user context and execution timeline of the suspicious queries.
    
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line arguments associated with the identified processes in the Windows Security logs to understand the specific actions attempted against the Veeam backup databases.
  - **Check EDR Alerts for Anomalies:** Search for active EDR alerts related to the investigated processes and correlate these findings with any historical alerts that may indicate compromised accounts or unusual access patterns.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Utilize SIEM to correlate this data with logs from other sources (e.g., AV, NGFW) to discern any additional indicators of compromise or related suspicious activities in the network.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with SQL queries targeting backup database credentials, which could lead to unauthorized data access or exfiltration if exploited successfully.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if attackers use non-standard tools to execute similar SQL queries or if they are able to obfuscate the command-line parameters sufficiently. It assumes that SQL server logging configurations and Windows process auditing are adequately set up. Additionally, misconfigured environments may lead to legitimate administrative activities being flagged as false positives.

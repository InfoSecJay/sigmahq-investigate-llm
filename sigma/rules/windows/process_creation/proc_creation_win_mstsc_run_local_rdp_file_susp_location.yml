  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for suspicious executions of the Microsoft Terminal Services Client (Mstsc.exe), particularly when it is used to load Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) files that originate from untrusted or uncommon locations. The rule looks for process creation events where the command line parameters specify a local ".rdp" file in directories such as "C:\Users\Public\" or "C:\Windows\Temp\", which are typically not associated with legitimate RDP usage. By focusing on the paths and file extensions related to the RDP files, the rule aims to identify potential misuse that could indicate an unauthorized remote connection attempt by an attacker. These types of actions correlate with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219 (Remote Access Software), where adversaries utilize tools like RDP to maintain access to compromised systems without being detected.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Command-Line Parameters**: Check the command-line parameters for the Mstsc.exe process in the EDR tool to confirm the RDP file being used and its origin path.
  - **Review Recent User Activity**: Utilize Windows Security logs to corroborate the activity of the user associated with the session, focusing on logons or access to the specific directories mentioned within the alert.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic**: Analyze network connection logs to detect whether any RDP traffic was initiated around the time the suspicious execution occurred, looking for unexpected outbound connections.
  - **Inspect User Context**: Investigate the user account executing the process to ensure it has a valid business purpose and examine previous access patterns for anomalies.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because unauthorized RDP access poses significant risks to the integrity and safety of enterprise systems, potentially leading to data breach scenarios or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that users will not typically launch RDP sessions from paths designated as suspicious. However, legitimate usage patterns may lead to false positives, particularly in environments where users may store their RDP files in unusual locations. Additionally, adversaries might obfuscate their activity by moving RDP files to trusted locations or disguising their actions in other processes, circumventing this detection.

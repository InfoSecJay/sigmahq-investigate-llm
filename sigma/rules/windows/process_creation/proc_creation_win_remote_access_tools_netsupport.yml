title: Remote Access Tool - NetSupport Execution

  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Remote Access Tool 
  - NetSupport Execution" focuses on detecting the execution of the NetSupport Remote Control application. This application can be exploited by malicious actors to establish unauthorized remote desktop connections, providing them with a command and control (C2) channel to compromised systems. The rule scans process creation logs for specific attributes associated with the NetSupport software, including its executable name ("PCICFGUI.EXE"), the product name ("NetSupport Remote Control"), and associated company details. As these remote access tools are often granted exceptions in application control policies, they pose a significant risk if leveraged by adversaries. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219 for targeting remote access software, which enables attackers to gain persistent access to systems within an organization's network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR solutions to examine the specific process creation logs related to NetSupport execution. Look for any processes that were spawned around the same time with a suspicious parent process to establish a potential attack chain.
    
  - **Review Network Connections:** Investigate any associated network connections that may indicate communication with external IPs during the remote access session. Use NDR tools to correlate the timing and direction of these connections.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Examine user activity logs to determine whether a legitimate user initiated the remote support session. This will help in identifying whether the action was part of normal operations or an unauthorized attempt.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Look at other alerts generated in the same timeframe from SIEM or EDR systems for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) that may support a malicious intent behind the execution of the NetSupport software.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium as the execution of remote access tools in a corporate environment can indicate potential abuse or malicious intent. Quick identification is crucial to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where NetSupport is legitimately used by IT support teams or is whitelisted in application control settings. Additionally, if the tool is renamed or if attackers use anti-detection techniques to mask its execution (such as running it from diskless systems), the rule may fail to trigger. It assumes that all instances of the specified executable are malicious, which may not always be the case. Further, in environments lacking robust logging or monitoring, the rule's effectiveness may be diminished.

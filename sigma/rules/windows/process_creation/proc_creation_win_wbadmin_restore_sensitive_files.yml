  Detects the dump of highly sensitive files such as "NTDS.DIT" and "SECURITY" hive.
  Attackers can leverage the "wbadmin" utility in order to dump sensitive files that might contain credential or sensitive information.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets potential misuse of the `wbadmin.exe` utility, which is native to Windows and used for backup and recovery operations. Attackers may exploit this tool to dump sensitive files, such as the NTDS.DIT file and the SECURITY hive, which could contain critical information like credentials and security policies. The rule watches for process creation events where `wbadmin.exe` is invoked with specific command-line parameters that indicate an attempt to recover sensitive data. The data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs and relevant command-line parameters captured by Windows Sysmon, specifically looking for instances where the utility is called with `recovery`, `recoveryTarget`, and certain file paths that indicate sensitive system files. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Credential Access** and the technique **T1003.003** (Credential Dumping: NTDS).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Examine the process creation logs from Sysmon to identify the specific instance of `wbadmin.exe` that triggered the alert. Look for the associated user account and the timing of the event.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments**: Validate the command-line parameters used with `wbadmin.exe` to confirm if sensitive object paths were included. Check for terms like `itemtype:File` along with targets such as `\config\SAM` or `\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit`.
  - **Cross-reference with User Activity**: Use EDR or AV logs to check for any unusual user activity around the time of the `wbadmin.exe` execution. Assess whether the user is authorized to perform backup and recovery tasks.
  - **Inspect Backup History and Result Logs**: Investigate Windows backup history or event logs for `wbadmin` to determine whether any successful recovery operations occurred before or after the alert. This can help identify if legitimate activities were misclassified.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high-risk nature of sensitive file recovery, the alert signifies potential credential exposure that could lead to unauthorized access to systems. A fast response is crucial, as compromised credentials can lead to further escalation of privileges and broader network exposure.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if `wbadmin` is executed without specifying the sensitive file parameters or if used in an unauthorized and legitimate manner (e.g., for backup operations by admins). Additionally, if the threat actor obfuscates command-line arguments or uses alternate means of credential dumping, such as PowerShell commands or other scripting techniques, the rule may fail to detect these activities. Responders should remain aware that sophisticated attackers may mimic legitimate administrative actions.

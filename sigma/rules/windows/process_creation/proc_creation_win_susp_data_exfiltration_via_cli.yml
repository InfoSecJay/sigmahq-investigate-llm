  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential data exfiltration activities through the use of command-line tools. It focuses on monitoring approved command-line interfaces, specifically `PowerShell`, `curl`, and `wget`, to identify suspicious patterns commonly associated with data theft attempts. The rule looks for particular command-line parameters that indicate web requests and data transmission, such as `Invoke-WebRequest`, `POST`, `--data`, and others. Furthermore, the rule searches for various common commands that could be used to retrieve sensitive information, including `hostname`, `netstat`, and `whoami`. Given its association with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it covers the Execution tactic (T1059.001) for command-line interface usage to initiate these potentially malicious actions.
  The rule relies on data from Windows process creation logs, specifically looking for instances where the noted binaries are executed with the above command-line arguments. This enables the detection of behaviors that are indicative of data exfiltration, facilitating timely response and investigation by security operations teams.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Examine logs for entries corresponding to the detected command-line tools (`PowerShell`, `curl`, `wget`) to verify if any suspicious commands were executed.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Focus on the command-line parameters captured in the alerts; confirm if they contain any data exfiltration markers or sensitive data retrieval commands.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Utilize EDR and Network Detection tools to assess outbound network connections made in conjunction with the detected processes, looking for unusual or unauthorized endpoints.
  - **Check Endpoint Security Alerts**: Review alerts from antivirus and endpoint protection systems for any additional context or identified threats associated with the user or machine involved in the activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as high, given that data exfiltration poses a significant risk to organizational integrity and compliance, necessitating immediate investigation and response.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where command-line utilities are heavily restricted or where proxies are used to encapsulate such operations. Additionally, if an attacker employs less common tools or uses built-in Windows functionalities outside standard command-line applications, the rule could fail to capture those activities. Assumptions include the presence of standard command-line tools and typical environment configurations, which may not account for variations such as custom or third-party software altering expected behaviors.

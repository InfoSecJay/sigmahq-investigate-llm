  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Execution of Shutdown" detection rule identifies instances where the `shutdown.exe` command is being invoked to shutdown or reboot Windows systems via command-line parameters. This can signify potentially unauthorized attempts to disrupt system availability, which may be indicative of various malicious actions, including denial of service or system manipulation. The rule monitors process creation logs for commands specifically calling `shutdown.exe` with parameters that denote a shutdown (`/s`) or restart (`/r`). These logs are integral in the detection process, as they provide essential data points, including the process image and command line executed. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Impact and technique T1529 (System Shutdown/Reboot), which focuses on an adversary's actions aimed at affecting system availability.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details**: Review the Sysmon process creation logs for the specific instance of `shutdown.exe` execution, noting the user context and the command line parameters used. Analyze any related Sysmon Event IDs that could provide additional context on the execution.
    
  - **Assess User Activity**: Investigate the user account that initiated the shutdown command. Confirm whether the user is authorized to perform such actions, and review their recent activities for any anomalies.
    
  - **Review System Logs**: Look at Windows Security, System, and Application event logs to identify any related events occurring around the same time as the shutdown command. This can provide insights into any preceding or succeeding actions that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Network and Remote Access Monitoring**: Analyze remote access logs (VPN and RDP) for any unusual access behavior prior to the execution of the shutdown command. This could help determine if the command was triggered remotely or was part of a broader attack strategy.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is prioritized as medium severity due to the potential for disruption of services and systems, which may severely impact business operations if executed maliciously. Any unauthorized execution of shutdown commands should be promptly investigated to ensure system integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses alternative methods to initiate a shutdown, such as using scripts or other tools that do not directly invoke `shutdown.exe`. Additionally, if the command is executed in a manner that prevents logging (e.g., through certain remote management tools or with system-level privileges), the detection may fail. Assumptions made involve the expected use of `shutdown.exe`, and cases where authorized personnel perform routine maintenance could lead to false positives.

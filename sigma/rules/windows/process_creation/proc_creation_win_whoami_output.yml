  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Whoami.EXE Execution With Output Option" is designed to identify instances where the `whoami.exe` utility is executed with specific command-line parameters indicating an intention to export output. The rule specifically focuses on executions that include the `/FO CSV` flag, which sets the output format to CSV, or the use of redirection (`whoami*>`) to send results to a file. These patterns may suggest malicious intents, such as data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs to detect anomalies associated with the normal usage of the `whoami` tool, which retrieves user and security information about the current user. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Discovery" tactic (T1033), which encompasses techniques that adversaries use to gather information about the system and network environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Use your EDR platform to query process creation events for `whoami.exe` with the relevant command line parameters. Look for any suspicious execution patterns that might indicate malicious intent.
  - **Review User Context:** Analyze the user account that initiated the `whoami.exe` command to assess the legitimacy of its execution. Look for any unusual user activity or context surrounding the alerting event.
  - **Inspect Output Files:** If the command was directed to save output (e.g., using `whoami*>`), check for newly created output files in the userâ€™s directory or other common locations. This could provide insight into the data being collected.
  - **Cross-Reference Network Activity:** Examine network logs to determine if there were subsequent connections or data transfers from the machine following the execution of `whoami.exe`. This may help identify any exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is given a medium severity level due to the potential for `whoami.exe` with output options to be used for information gathering by an adversary, which could lead to further exploitation or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in scenarios where the parameters used do not exactly match those specified (e.g., using variations of the output flag or command). Additionally, if the `whoami.exe` process is executed in a context that bypasses standard logging (e.g., exploitation of administrative tools or within certain script environments), it may not be captured. It is assumed that the logging mechanism for process creation is properly configured on all endpoints.

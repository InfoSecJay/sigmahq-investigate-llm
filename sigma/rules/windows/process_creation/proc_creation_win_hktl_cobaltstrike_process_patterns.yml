  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential patterns associated with Cobalt Strike beacon activity, a prevalent tool utilized by threat actors for post-exploitation. The detection focuses on process creation logs for specific command-line patterns and parent image source paths that are commonly indicative of Cobalt Strikeâ€™s operational methods. By analyzing command lines that end with 'cmd.exe /C whoami' and parent images that originate from unusual locations (e.g., 'C:\Temp\'), this rule can identify potentially malicious activity. Additionally, the rule looks for specific patterns involving the conhost.exe process and various command-line invocations that utilize Windows named pipes, another method often employed by the Cobalt Strike framework. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), highlighting the execution tactic used by adversaries.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Locate the instances of process creation that triggered the alert in your EDR, focusing on the specific command lines mentioned in the Sigma rule.
    
  - **Analyze Parent Processes:** Check the parent processes of the identified command lines to determine if they originated from uncommon sources, such as temporary directories, which may suggest malicious intent.
  - **Examine Network Connections:** Investigate any outbound or unusual inbound network connections related to the identified processes to understand potential command and control (C2) communications.
  - **Correlate with Other Data Sources:** Utilize Proxy, VPN, or cloud logs to see if there are any related activities or anomalies that correlate with the alert timeframe and originating processes.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the known association of Cobalt Strike with advanced persistent threats (APTs) and potential data exfiltration or system compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary employs obfuscation techniques, changes the execution patterns, or uses less suspicious parent processes for launching Cobalt Strike. Additionally, if the command-line parameters are altered or if the tool is running in an environment with overly permissive security settings, the detection could be bypassed. It is assumed that analysts maintain a baseline knowledge of normal process activities to effectively identify deviations.

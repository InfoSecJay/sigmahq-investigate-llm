  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential password spraying attempts using the `dsacls.exe` utility in Windows. Password spraying is a method used by attackers where they try a small number of commonly used passwords against many accounts, thus reducing the chance of account lockouts. The rule specifically looks for process creation events of `dsacls.exe`, an administrative tool used for managing Active Directory object permissions. Key logs monitored include the command-line parameters that reveal if the tool is being used with the `/user:` and `/passwd:` options, which are indicative of attempts to validate credentials against directory services. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218, which covers the use of signed binaries for living off the land.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Windows event logs for instances of `dsacls.exe` being executed. Look specifically for the associated `CommandLine` arguments that include `/user:` and `/passwd:` to confirm if the password spraying technique was utilized.
    
  - **Correlate with Active Directory Logs:** Examine Active Directory logs for any related authentication failures from accounts that match the timestamps of the `dsacls.exe` executions. This will help identify if multiple failed login attempts correlate with the potential attack.
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Use your EDR solution to identify any alerts in conjunction with `dsacls.exe` usage. Investigate any additional unusual behavior or lateral movements logged around the same timeframe.
  - **Assess User Behavior:** Evaluate the accounts involved in running `dsacls.exe`. Determine if these actions are consistent with normal user behavior or indicative of credential abuse, especially focusing on any accounts with administrative privileges.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity since while the invocation of `dsacls.exe` can occur legitimately within an enterprise environment, it is often associated with reconnaissance activities and potential password spraying attempts, necessitating prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule is effective for detecting potential misuse of `dsacls.exe`, it assumes that such commands are executed in a context where command-line logging is enabled; if logging is poor, it may not capture all instances of interest. Additionally, if an attacker uses a different binary or obfuscates their command-line inputs, the rule may fail to fire. Similarly, legitimate administrative use may create false positives, particularly in environments where authorized personnel frequently utilize `dsacls.exe` for valid operational purposes.

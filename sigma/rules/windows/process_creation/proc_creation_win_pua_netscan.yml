  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of SoftPerfect's "netscan.exe," a network scanning application that threat actors often leverage to map and understand the network topology of a victim's environment. The rule operates by scrutinizing process creation logs for instances where processes with the specific image name 'netscan.exe' are spawned. Additionally, it checks the product name to confirm that it is identified as 'Network Scanner' with a description indicating its functionality. Given the potential misuse of this tool for reconnaissance purposes by adversaries, the rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Discovery (T1046)**, which encompasses techniques used by attackers to gather information about systems and networks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Check the process creation logs via Sysmon or Windows Event Logs to ascertain the provenance of the 'netscan.exe' executionâ€”look for unusual parent processes or execution paths.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze network connections initiated by 'netscan.exe,' confirming if it has made any external communications that could indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Check User Context:** Review user account logs to determine if the executing user typically engages in legitimate scanning or network assessment activities, confirming if this execution aligns with normal behavior.
  - **Identify Historical Usage:** Search for previous instances of 'netscan.exe' execution in your environment to differentiate between malicious uses and legitimate administrative tasks.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for this tool to be misused by threat actors to engage in reconnaissance within the network. Even if the activity appears benign, the use of known tools for network scanning warrants further investigation to rule out malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that 'netscan.exe' will be present in predictable locations on disk and executed by a legitimate user in a way that is not masked by malicious processes. It may not fire if the threat actor uses obfuscation techniques or renames the executable. Furthermore, legitimate administrative activities may trigger false positives, suggesting the need for contextual understanding of user behavior and system configurations. Notably, instances where organizations have implemented strict application whitelisting might prevent execution altogether, rendering the rule ineffective.

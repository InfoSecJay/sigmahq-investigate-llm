  ### Technical Context
  The "Read Contents From Stdin Via Cmd.EXE" rule is designed to detect the use of the "cmd.exe" command-line interpreter in Windows for reading input from standard input via the less-than symbol ("<"). This functionality can be employed by attackers to execute files or scripts hidden from direct observation, making it an important behavior to monitor in an enterprise security context. The rule specifically looks for processes that are initiated using "cmd.exe," with the condition requiring that the command line contains the character "<," indicating an attempt to redirect input from a file. 
  The relevant technical data sources for this detection are the process creation logs, which capture details about processes being instantiated on the system, including the command-line parameters used to launch them. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the "Execution" tactic and the "Command-Line Interface" technique (T1059.003), which encompasses any actions performed using shell commands.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Windows Security event logs for the creation of 'cmd.exe' processes containing "<" in the command line to confirm potential misuse.
    
  - **Analyze Command Parameters:** Use EDR tools to examine the complete command-line arguments passed to 'cmd.exe' to identify the specific files that were being accessed or executed.
  - **Correlate with EDR and AV Alerts:** Investigate any related alerts from EDR or AV solutions that might indicate malicious activity resulting from the use of 'cmd.exe,' particularly if other indicators of compromise are present.
  - **Examine Related Network Activity:** Look into outbound or other suspicious network connections that may correlate with the use of 'cmd.exe,' especially if external addresses were involved during the execution of the command.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is prioritized as medium severity because the use of "cmd.exe" with input redirection can indicate potentially malicious behavior, warranting further investigation, especially if it occurs in sensitive environments or is linked with other anomalous activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire under circumstances where "cmd.exe" is not being used to execute commands or where input redirection is obscured using methods such as encoded commands or other scripting languages. Additionally, legitimate administrative use of input redirection may also generate false positives. The effectiveness of this rule is contingent upon proper configuration and monitoring of process creation logs; any gaps in log retention or overlooked command invocations can result in missed detections.

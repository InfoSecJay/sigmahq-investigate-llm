  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Use Short Name Path in Command Line" is designed to detect instances where applications utilize Windows 8.3 short file names in command-line arguments. This technique allows attackers to circumvent command-line monitoring mechanisms, which may not recognize the abbreviated paths. The rule inspects process creation logs, focusing on command-line parameters that contain short names (notated as `~1`, `~2`, etc.) while filtering out known legitimate applications that may use this behavior, such as `Dism.exe`, `cleanmgr.exe`, and `WebexHost.exe`. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of defense evasion (TA0005) and specifically the technique T1564.004â€”"Hide Command and Control." By leveraging sources like Windows Security event logs, incident responders can identify suspicious usage of these short names and investigate further.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Use your EDR tool to review the process creation logs of the detected short name command-line execution, noting the parent and child processes involved.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Examine the command-line parameters for any unusual patterns or known malicious indicators, especially focusing on the presence of short name formats.
  - **Correlate with Known Applications**: Validate the context by correlating the parent process with legitimate applications that may generate short name command-line arguments, referring to the filter criteria in the rule documentation.
  - **Review Related Activity**: Investigate other telemetry sources such as Sysmon logs and application logs to see if there are additional indicators of compromise (IoC) tied to this behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is rated as medium due to the potential for an attacker to use short file names to obscure malicious commands, making it significant for operational awareness while requiring contextual analysis to rule out benign application behavior.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if applications commonly use short names without malicious intent, which could lead to false positives. Additionally, if an attacker employs techniques to execute commands without invoking the application associated with a documented parent process, such as through scripts or other obfuscation methods, the detection may be bypassed. Awareness of these limitations is crucial for incident responders to accurately assess alerts versus regular operational behavior.

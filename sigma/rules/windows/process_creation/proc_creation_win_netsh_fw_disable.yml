  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies instances where the Windows firewall is disabled using the `netsh.exe` command-line utility. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the command line indicates that the firewall is being turned off. This can include commands such as `netsh firewall set opmode disable` or `netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`. The detection leverages data from Windows process creation logs, focusing on the `netsh.exe` executable and specific command-line parameters that indicate an action to disable the firewall. This activity is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.004 ("Disable Security Tools"), which falls under the tactic of "Defense Evasion." The disablement of essential security mechanisms like the Windows firewall can create vulnerabilities that malicious actors may exploit, making it critical to monitor and investigate such events promptly.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the EDR console for any instances of `netsh.exe` running, noting the timestamps and user context to determine if the activity appears malicious or legitimate.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check for corresponding user activity through system logs (e.g., Windows Security logs) to validate whether the command execution correlates with an authorized administrative action.
  - **Assess Potential Impact:** Investigate additional logs related to network connections and changes in firewall rules to evaluate if any external traffic or configuration changes align with the command execution time.
  - **Validate Against Baseline:** Compare the detected command or associated user behavior against your organization's baseline to determine whether such changes are standard practice or indicative of a potential security incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a medium severity level because disabling the firewall can significantly reduce the security posture of the environment, making systems more susceptible to external threats while also sometimes being a legitimate administrative task.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker disables the firewall through alternative methods, such as using a different command-line tool or if a system administrator performs the action without logging it adequately. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities could trigger false positives, as skilled users may disable the firewall for valid reasons (e.g., troubleshooting). The detection relies on the presence of `netsh.exe`, so if an attacker employs a different method or executes the command from a non-standard environment, the rule may fail to capture the activity.

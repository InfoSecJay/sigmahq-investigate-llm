  Adversaries may abuse msiexec.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
  Msiexec.exe is the command-line utility for the Windows Installer and is thus commonly associated with executing installation packages (.msi)

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activities involving `msiexec.exe`, the Windows Installer utility commonly used for executing installation packages (.msi). Adversaries may exploit `msiexec.exe` to indirectly execute malicious payloads under the guise of legitimate installation processes. The rule specifically looks for command lines that contain the `-y` argument, which is often associated with commands that install software without user interaction. It employs process creation logs from Windows, monitoring the command-line parameters that are passed to `msiexec.exe`. By filtering out known benign command lines, it reduces false positives and focuses on potentially malicious executions that could relate to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218.007 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR tools to examine recent process creation logs for any instances of `msiexec.exe` executing with the `-y` parameter. Pay special attention to unusual parent processes.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Details**: Analyze the complete command line associated with `msiexec.exe` executions to assess for any suspicious DLL paths, particularly those not commonly associated with legitimate installations.
  - **Cross-Reference with Known Good Entries**: Consult internal documentation or threat intelligence sources to verify whether the identified DLL files (e.g., those from Bonjour or Apple Software Update) are expected in your environment.
  - **Monitor for Follow-On Activities**: If a suspicious `msiexec.exe` execution is confirmed, use network and process monitoring tools to identify any follow-on activities, such as network connections or additional processes spawned by the initial execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is marked as medium because, while it indicates potential malicious activity, the presence of `msiexec.exe` can also stem from legitimate software installations. Rapid investigation is necessary to discern the intent behind the command, especially in environments where many legitimate installers are commonly executed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `msiexec.exe` is executed in a non-standard manner or from compromised legitimate processes that do not follow the documented command patterns. Furthermore, if adversaries leverage obfuscation techniques or run their scripts in a fully legitimate context (such as signed software), the detection may be circumvented. Assumptions made in crafting the rule include the consistent use of log sources and expected command-line parameters.

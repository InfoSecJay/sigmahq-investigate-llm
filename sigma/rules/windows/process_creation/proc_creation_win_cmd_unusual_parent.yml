  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify suspicious instances of `cmd.exe` being invoked by certain unusual parent processes. In typical Windows environments, `cmd.exe` is often launched by common applications, services, or user interactions; however, when it is initiated by unusual parent processes (e.g., `csrss.exe`, `lsass.exe`, and others listed in the rule), it may indicate malicious activity, such as process injection or exploitation attempts. The rule detects these anomalies using Windows process creation logs, which provide details about the parent-child relationship between processes, specifically looking at the image names and their behaviors. This detection effort aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Execution tactic and technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze the process creation logs in your EDR to identify the specific instances of `cmd.exe` execution and their associated parent processes as detected by this alert.
  - **Investigate Unusual Parent Processes:** For any alerts triggered, investigate the unusual parent processes to determine their legitimacy; focus on understanding if these processes were designed to run in your environment and if they were active at the time of the `cmd.exe` execution.
  - **Cross-reference with Windows Logs:** Look into the Windows Event Logs (particularly the Security and System logs) for any correlating events that may provide additional context around user actions, program executions, or system changes around the time of detection.
  - **Check for Related Network Activity:** Utilize NDR and proxy logs to identify any outbound network connections initiated by `cmd.exe` that might suggest data exfiltration or communication with command-and-control (C2) servers following its launch.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for malicious behavior being hidden in benign-looking processes. While not all instances may indicate compromise, the unusual invocation of `cmd.exe` warrants further investigation to rule out nefarious activities.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The detection may not fire if the malicious execution of `cmd.exe` is conducted through common parent processes not listed in the rule's criteria. Additionally, attackers could deliberately use legitimate-looking processes to evade detection. There is also an inherent assumption that process creation logs are capturing all relevant events accurately without gaps or log retention issues, which may not always be the case in certain environments.

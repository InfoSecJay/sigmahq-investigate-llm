  Detects the presence of the "u202+E" character, which causes a terminal, browser, or operating system to render text in a right-to-left sequence.
  This is used as an obfuscation and masquerading techniques.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on detecting obfuscation techniques utilized by malicious actors through the use of the Right-to-Left Override (RTLO) character (Unicode: U+202E). The RTLO character allows text to be rendered in a right-to-left sequence, which can be exploited to disguise commands or file names, thereby evading security mechanisms that rely on a left-to-right reading order. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the command line contains this character, leveraging Windows process creation logs as the primary data source. By identifying such anomalies, we can flag potential instances of defense evasion, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (technique T1036.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze Windows process creation logs for instances of the RTLO character in command line arguments to identify potentially malicious activities obscured by this technique.
  - **Cross-reference with EDR Data:** Utilize the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool to gather further context on the processes initiated, including parent-child relationships and associated user accounts.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Check for unusual outbound network connections or command and control (C2) calls associated with the detected processes, potentially indicating further malicious activity.
  - **Evaluate False Positives:** Investigate whether the command lines flagged are legitimate business operations, such as script execution involving Hebrew or Arabic content that may also use the RTLO character.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for sophisticated evasion techniques employed by adversaries to carry out malicious activities without detection, which could compromise sensitive systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where command-line obfuscation techniques are not routinely employed or where monitoring of process creation is inadequate. Additionally, benign scripts that include Hebrew or Arabic characters may lead to false positives. Furthermore, if the evasion technique involved employs a more sophisticated approach that avoids command lines entirely (such as using environmental variables), this rule would fail to detect such activity.

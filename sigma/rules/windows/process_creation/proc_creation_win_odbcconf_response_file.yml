  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the execution of the `odbcconf.exe` application in a Windows environment, specifically looking for commands that include the `-f` flag. The use of this flag indicates that the application is being instructed to load a response file, often with a `.rsp` extension, which may potentially contain instructions for malicious actions. By analyzing the command-line parameters of the process creation logs as recorded by Windows Security Event Logs and Sysmon, this rule can identify suspicious or unauthorized uses of `odbcconf.exe`. The detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Defense Evasion, namely T1218.008, which highlights the use of system tools or binaries as a means for adversaries to execute malicious activities under the guise of legitimate applications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check your EDR solution for the `odbcconf.exe` process execution history, focusing on the execution timestamps and user accounts to establish if the usage was warranted.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line parameters associated with the `odbcconf.exe` execution in the Windows Event Logs to identify the presence and contents of the involved response file and flags used.
  - **Analyze Response File Contents:** If a response file was utilized, access and review its contents to determine if it contains any indicators of compromise, such as commands or settings designed for malicious purposes.
  - **Cross-reference with User Activity Logs:** Investigate the user activity and access logs around the time of the execution to see if this action is consistent with user behavior or if it could indicate potential insider threats or compromised accounts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for `odbcconf.exe` to be abused in executing harmful scripts or commands through its response files. The context of its usage should be thoroughly understood, as legitimate operations can also trigger this rule, necessitating careful investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger if `odbcconf.exe` is executed without the `-f` flag or if the response file is not named with a `.rsp` extension. Additionally, legitimate instances of `odbcconf.exe` that rely on a response file may generate false positives, which requires analysts to assess the contents of the provided `.rsp` files critically. It is assumed that defenders have visibility into process creation logs; however, if logging levels are inadequately configured, this rule may fail to capture pertinent events. Adversaries could mitigate detection by using different methods or tools to achieve their goals.

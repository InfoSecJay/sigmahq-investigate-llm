  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "File Encryption Using Gpg4win" focuses on detecting unauthorized or suspicious use of the Gpg4win software, specifically the `gpg.exe` and `gpg2.exe` executables. This software is commonly used for encrypting files using GnuPG's OpenPGP tool. The rule triggers when a process creation event indicates that these executables are running with specific command-line parameters, notably those including a passphrase and the `-c` flag, which denotes file encryption. The data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs that capture details about the executable processes, such as their command line and image description. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Execution" (TA0002) and the technique of "User Execution" (T1204), as it aims to identify potential misuse of encryption tools that may be used maliciously in data exfiltration or obfuscation efforts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the EDR for the execution of `gpg.exe` or `gpg2.exe` to determine if these processes were initiated from a legitimate or suspicious parent process.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line arguments associated with these processes in the process creation logs to identify any unusual patterns or the use of a passphrase that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Cross-Reference with Security Logs:** Utilize Windows Security Event Logs to look for user logon events around the time of the encryption activity to establish the legitimacy of the user or session.
  - **Assess File Integrity and Access:** Investigate any files that were encrypted during this timeframe; check their paths and any associated file access logs to see if sensitive data was targeted.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level is assigned to this alert due to the potential misuse of encryption tools, which can facilitate data exfiltration and obfuscation by malicious actors. Investigating alerts of this nature is crucial, especially in environments handling sensitive information.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the Gpg4win tool is executed without the monitored command-line parameters or if it is being run under different executable names or aliases. Additionally, if adversaries utilize obfuscation techniques or use trusted processes to launch Gpg4win, the detection may be bypassed. The effectiveness of the rule depends on a thorough understanding of authorized use cases and legitimate operational behavior surrounding file encryption in the enterprise environment.

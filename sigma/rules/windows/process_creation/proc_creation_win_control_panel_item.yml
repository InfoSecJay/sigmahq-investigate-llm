  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activities involving control panel items in the Windows operating system. Specifically, it targets executions of the `reg.exe` utility, which is often leveraged by attackers to manipulate the Windows Registry for various purposes, including persistence and evasion of defenses. The rule looks for command-line parameters that indicate the registry modifications related to Control Panel items, particularly `.cpl` files which are Control Panel extensions. By monitoring process creation logs that reflect these activities, we can identify when an adversary attempts to load a Control Panel item using `reg.exe` or other related commands. This detection leverages the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1218.002 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Control Panel Items) and T1546 (Event Triggered Execution), providing insights into potential execution tactics used to bypass security measures and maintain a foothold within a target environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Investigate the specific alerts triggered by this detection in your EDR platform to gather additional contextual information about the source process and user initiating the action.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Examine Windows Sysmon logs for detailed process creation events logged before and after the alert, focusing on the command lines used and any parent-child process relationships.
  - **Inspect Registry Changes:** Utilize registry monitoring tools or Windows Event Logs to review for any corresponding changes under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CPLs` to confirm malicious modifications.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Check network logs to see if any related outbound connections were made (possibly indicating data exfiltration or command and control communications initiated as a result of the execution).
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity level due to the potential implication of attackers manipulating Control Panel items to maintain persistence or evade detection, which can result in further compromise within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate administrative actions frequently use similar method calls or where endpoint configurations lack sufficient logging detail. Additionally, if an adversary employs alternative techniques or native tools that are not captured in this rule's logic, the detection may be bypassed. It is also assumed that all necessary logging agents are correctly configured and running on targeted endpoints.

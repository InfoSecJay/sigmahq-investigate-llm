  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious child processes being spawned directly from Microsoft Outlook (OUTLOOK.EXE). The rule is designed to flag potential malicious activity by monitoring for specific child processes commonly associated with exploitation techniques, such as command-line utilities (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) and application executables (e.g., `msbuild.exe`, `mshta.exe`) that are executed as sub-processes of Outlook. By leveraging process creation logs, the rule captures relevant metadata, including the command line and parent command line arguments, to detect deviations from normal application behavior. This rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1204.002 (Malicious File Execution), highlighting its pertinence in uncovering attempts to execute harmful payloads or scripts using trusted applications as launch points.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Alert Context:** Analyze the alert context within the SIEM to identify the specific process (`OUTLOOK.EXE`) that spawned the suspicious child process and examine the associated timestamps and user accounts.
  - **Check Process Details in EDR:** Use EDR tools to gather additional information on the identified child process, checking for details such as process hashes, network activity, and parent-child process relationships.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Usage:** Investigate the command-line arguments associated with the child process using logs such as Sysmon or Process Creation logs to determine if they indicate legitimate use or abuse.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to examine outbound network connections made by the suspicious child process, focusing on anomalies that could indicate exfiltration or C2 communication.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high alert severity, this rule indicates a significant risk that could involve malicious activity leveraged through a trusted application (Outlook), which may bypass initial security measures. Immediate investigation is warranted to assess potential threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where an adversary uses non-traditional means to execute their processes or if the environment has custom configurations that prevent Outlook from spawning expected child processes. Additionally, if legitimate applications or scripts inadvertently utilize similar command-line arguments as the defined suspicious processes, false positives may occur. A recognition of existing security configurations (like application whitelisting) and users' legitimate behavior patterns is essential for minimizing noise in detections.

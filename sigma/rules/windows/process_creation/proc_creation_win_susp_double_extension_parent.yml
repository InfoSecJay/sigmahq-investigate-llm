  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Parent Double Extension File Execution" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious executions of files that are masquerading as document types while having double extensions (e.g., `.doc.lnk`, `.doc.js`). This tactic often serves as an evasion strategy, aiming to trick users into executing harmful scripts that can facilitate malware payloads or other malicious activities. The rule leverages process creation logs to capture relevant parent process information, specifically targeting processes that have been launched with suspicious command line arguments. The relevant technical data sources include the `ParentImage` and `ParentCommandLine` fields from process creation logs provided by Windows Sysmon. The detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1036.007 (Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs**: Review EDR logs for the process execution timeline associated with the alert to identify any abnormal actions preceding the suspicious file execution.
  - **Analyze Parent Process**: Investigate the parent process that triggered the alert to determine if it is a legitimate application or potentially malicious software attempting to execute the suspicious file.
  - **Inspect Network Connections**: Use network logs to assess any outbound connections made by the suspicious process. This can reveal possible communications with command-and-control servers.
  - **Collect File Details**: Retrieve details about the suspicious file (e.g., hash values, file path) using file analysis tools, and compare it against threat intelligence sources like VirusTotal to check for known indicators of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been assigned a high severity level due to the potential risks associated with double extension files, which can signify malicious intent to execute harmful content on enterprise systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in scenarios where the execution of double extension files is legitimate or where the attacker uses different file naming conventions that evade detection. Additionally, certain benign applications could produce similar process creation events, leading to false positives. Furthermore, if auditing is insufficient or if Sysmon logs are not properly configured, this rule may fail to capture relevant events.

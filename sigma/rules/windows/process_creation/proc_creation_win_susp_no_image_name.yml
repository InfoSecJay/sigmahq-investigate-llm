  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect the execution of processes that are launched without a valid image name on Windows systems. Specifically, it identifies instances where a process is initiated that does not have the standard ".exe" file extension in its image name. Such tactics are often employed by adversaries to evade detection systems that rely on image-based signatures. The telemetry for this detection is gathered from Windows Sysmon process creation logs, which provide detailed insights into process lifecycle events, including timestamps, parent processes, and command-line arguments. By monitoring process creation events for the absence of recognizable image names, the rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Defense Evasion (TA0005). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Utilize your EDR tool to gather more detailed information about the flagged process, including its command-line arguments and parent-child process relationships. This can help identify if the process is legitimate or part of a suspicious activity.
    
  - **Review Logs for Similar Events:** Search the Sysmon process creation logs to identify any other instances of processes launched without an image name during the same time frame. Correlating this data can uncover patterns indicative of malicious actions.
    
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Inspect network connection logs from your firewall or NDR to see if the flagged process made any unusual outbound connections. This may provide insight into whether the process is attempting to communicate with known malicious domains.
    
  - **Scan for Malware:** Conduct a thorough check using your antivirus solution to see if the flagged process or its parent has been identified as malicious in any threat intelligence feeds. A quick scan can help confirm or mitigate potential risk.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for malicious activity associated with processes launched without an identifiable image name, which are commonly exploited for evasion tactics. However, rare legitimate use cases exist, requiring further investigation to differentiate between benign and malicious activity. 
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious processes utilize known legitimate names or are executed in a manner that conforms to standard naming conventions (e.g., using an ".exe" extension). Additionally, it assumes that proper logging is enabled and that Sysmon is configured appropriately to capture complete process creation details. Adversaries can easily circumvent this detection by employing processes with legitimate image names, thereby evading such monitoring strategies.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of `InfDefaultInstall.exe` with a command line that contains a `.inf` file. This executable is typically used for installing device drivers on Windows systems by utilizing the Windows Installer service. The specific focus of this detection mechanism is to identify when the tool is used to execute scripts embedded in .inf files, leveraging `scrobj.dll`, which is often associated with the execution of malicious scripts. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactic of **Defense Evasion**, with the technique `T1218: Signed Binary Proxy Execution`. The rule primarily monitors **process creation logs** from Windows systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation events in your EDR solutions for any instances of `InfDefaultInstall.exe` being executed and review their parent process for legitimacy.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Examine the command line arguments associated with the detected instance for any unusual `.inf` files or parameters that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **User Activity Review:** Investigate the user account linked to the execution to determine if it has requesting access rights and if the activity aligns with expected user behavior.
  - **Cross-Reference with Security Logs:** Correlate with Windows Security, Application, or System logs to identify preceding events that may contextualize the execution, such as potential exploitation attempts or escalated privileges.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated from this rule has a **medium** severity level due to its potential association with non-standard usage of system binaries that can indicate evasion tactics being employed by an adversary. While not every invocation of `InfDefaultInstall.exe` is malicious, its detection warrants further investigation to rule out unauthorized executions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in environments where `InfDefaultInstall.exe` is executed legitimately as part of routine software installation or driver updates. Additionally, advanced adversaries might utilize techniques to obfuscate their command line usage, such as encoding or modifying the executableâ€™s name. Analysts should be aware that some inf files could be benign or part of an authorized process, leading to potential false positives unless adequately investigated.

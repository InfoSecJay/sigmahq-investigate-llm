  ### Technical Context
  The "CreateDump Process Dump" detection rule identifies potential misuse of the `createdump.exe` utility, which is commonly associated with process memory dumping capabilities often employed by adversaries. This rule specifically looks for instances where `createdump.exe` is invoked with certain command-line parameters that suggest an intent to extract process memory, typically for exploitation or analysis purposes. The telemetry utilized for this detection primarily comes from Windows process creation logs, which relay details about the execution of processes, including the image being executed, as well as its command-line arguments. 
  By monitoring for the process image ending with `\createdump.exe` and command-line arguments that include flags like `-u`, `--full`, `-f`, and `.dmp`, the rule indicates a tactical response to the MITRE ATT&CK framework's techniques associated with defense evasion (T1036) and credential dumping (T1003.001). Through effective monitoring using relevant technical data sources, the rule assists in uncovering potential activities that may be obfuscating malicious intent against enterprise systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation:** Check the corresponding process creation logs in the EDR to confirm the invocation of `createdump.exe` and analyze the user's account associated with the execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the arguments used in the command line to ascertain the context of the dump operation, determining if these parameters suggest a legitimate use or malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with Event Logs:** Review Windows Security and Application logs for any suspicious activity or failed authentication events that may align with the timeframe of the process dump invocation.
  - **Consult Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference the activity with threat intelligence feeds or known indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to process dump utilities to assess whether the activity is linked to documented threat actors.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity level due to the association of process dumping tools with potential data exfiltration and credential theft. Such behavior in an enterprise environment is often indicative of an active threat, necessitating immediate investigation to prevent possible breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger when the `createdump.exe` utility is executed with modified command-line arguments or when the utility is renamed to circumvent detection. Additionally, legitimate use cases, such as debugging software or system analysis, might also generate false positives, particularly with command lines that employ similar flags. It is assumed that all instances of the utility invocation will be logged; however, misconfigurations in logging or issues relating to privileged access may lead to missed detections. Understanding these nuances can greatly assist detection engineers in refining their strategies for adversary engagement.

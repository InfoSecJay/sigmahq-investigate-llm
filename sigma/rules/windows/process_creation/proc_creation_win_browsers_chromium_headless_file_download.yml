  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the execution of Chromium-based web browsers running in headless mode, specifically using the command line parameters `--headless` and `dump-dom` to download files from the internet. This technique can be leveraged by cyber adversaries to enable covert operations—by executing scripts that interact with web content without a graphical user interface, attackers can evade detection mechanisms while automating tasks like scraping or downloading files. The rule utilizes process creation logs from Windows, particularly monitoring for specific browser executable names (e.g., `chrome.exe`, `brave.exe`, `msedge.exe`, etc.) along with the relevant command-line arguments. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Command and Control tactic (T1105), where adversaries may use external utilities to transfer files and data.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize your EDR solution to examine process creation logs for instances of the specified browser executables run with the detected command-line parameters, paying special attention to any anomalous execution times or user contexts.
  - **Analyze Network Activity**: Check network logs for any outbound connections made by the identified browser processes, especially those involving suspicious domains or protocols that may indicate data exfiltration.
  - **Monitor File System Changes**: Look through file system logs to track any file downloads initiated by the headless browsers, as this may provide insight into the nature of the downloaded content and its relevance to the investigation.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Investigate user activity logs and behaviors during the timeframe of the alert to determine if legitimate activities may explain the browser's usage or if they diverged from normal operational patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is deemed high severity due to the potential use of headless browsers for malicious activities such as data exfiltration or command execution, which can indicate a serious incident. Immediate attention is warranted to assess and contain these threats before they escalate.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Recognized blind spots include environments where headless browser activities are legitimate, leading to potential false positives without proper context. Additionally, the detection relies heavily on the execution of command-line parameters; if an adversary modifies their technique to use different arguments or less common browsers not covered by this rule, it may fail to trigger. The assumption is made that all monitored systems have standard browser installations and configurations—custom installations or obscure browser versions could evade detection.

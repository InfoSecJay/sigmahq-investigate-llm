  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential Credential Dumping Via LSASS Process Clone" detection rule focuses on identifying suspicious activity related to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process in Windows environments. Credential dumping is a common attack strategy used by adversaries to extract sensitive information, such as user credentials, from memory. This rule specifically looks for instances where a new process ends with `\Windows\System32\lsass.exe`, which is often a sign of attempts to clone the legitimate LSASS process. It evaluates process creation events while checking if the parent process is also an instance of `lsass.exe`, indicating a possible unauthorized replication of this critical security service. This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1003 (Credential Dumping) and T1003.001 (LSASS Memory), which describe methods used by threat actors to bypass security controls and extract credentials.
  The primary data sources for this detection include Windows process creation logs, allowing the rule to capture critical details about how LSASS is being utilized and whether there are any anomalous process behaviors indicative of credential dumping attempts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Source Process:** Use EDR tools to check the process tree for the suspicious lsass.exe instance to ascertain its lineage and any associated parent processes.
  - **Inspect Process Memory:** If applicable, leverage memory forensics tools to analyze the memory space of the cloned LSASS process for signs of credential extraction tools or leftover artifacts.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Examine authentication and access logs from Windows Security Event Logs to detect any unusual logon attempts or failed access correlated to the times of the alerts.
  - **Egress and Network Monitoring:** Utilize NDR solutions to investigate any network connections generated by the suspicious LSASS process to identify potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communications.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert indicates potential credential dumping, it is prioritized as critical. In an enterprise environment, successful credential theft can lead to unauthorized access, significant data breaches, and extensive damage to organizational integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker employs sophisticated techniques to evade detection, such as using legitimate credentials or bypassing process monitoring methods. Additionally, if the LSASS process is not properly logged due to configuration issues, or if the attack occurs on a non-standard system or a virtualized environment without proper telemetry, the detection may fail to trigger. It is assumed that the environment consistently collects and retains relevant process creation logs, including those from Sysmon.

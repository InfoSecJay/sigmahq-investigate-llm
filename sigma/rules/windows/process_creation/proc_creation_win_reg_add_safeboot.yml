  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of the Windows Registry utility 'reg.exe' with specific command-line parameters that imply modifications to Safe Boot registry keys. Attackers often employ these actions to ensure ransomware can operate in Safe Mode, circumventing some security products that may be inactive during such boot processes. The rule looks for the presence of the 'add' or 'copy' flags in conjunction with paths directing to '\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot,' using Windows process creation logs as the primary data source. When this rule is triggered, it aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001 (Impair Defenses), helping security teams to proactively investigate potential threats.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check EDR logs for the execution of 'reg.exe' and correlate with the time of the alert to determine if any other suspicious processes were running concurrently.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the specific command-line arguments used in the process creation event to ascertain potential malicious intent and cross-reference with other investigative tools.
  - **Inspect Registry Changes:** Utilize registry auditing tools or scripts to identify changes made to the Safe Boot keys and evaluate whether these align with known good processes or user actions.
  - **Review Security Logs:** Check Windows Security logs for any anomalies or other events around the same timestamp, especially events related to user logins, privilege escalations, or security products being disabled.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the implication of ransomware potentially being able to execute in Safe Mode, this alert is prioritized as high severity. Actions taken to modify Safe Boot registry settings could signal an imminent threat to enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the execution of 'reg.exe' does not occur in a way that is captured by the telemetry, such as being executed in a non-standard manner or from a compromised application. It also assumes that the monitoring and alerts are deployed effectively on all endpoints, and that defenders are aware of legitimate administrative use of the 'reg.exe' tool. Adversaries might employ various obfuscation techniques to either bypass this detection or utilize other tools that can achieve the same ends without triggering this rule.

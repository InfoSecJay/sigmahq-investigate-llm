  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule targets the execution of the Windows Kernel Debugger (kd.exe), which is a tool primarily utilized by developers and system administrators for troubleshooting and debugging the Windows kernel. The rule watches for specific indicators within process creation logs, looking for instances where the image name ends with "kd.exe" and the original file name corresponds to "kd.exe." Executions of this tool can indicate potential misuse for privilege escalation or attempts to evade defenses, fitting into the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of "Defense Evasion" and "Privilege Escalation." In a typical enterprise environment, the presence of unexpected kd.exe executions may suggest malicious activity, warranting further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs around the time the alert was triggered, focusing on the user context and the parent process of "kd.exe" executions.
  - **Check for Anomalous Behavior**: Analyze network connections and file access logs to identify any suspicious activities or patterns associated with the processes spawned by kd.exe.
  - **Validate User Context**: Investigate whether the execution of kd.exe aligns with legitimate use cases for the identified user. Confirm if the user had a valid reason to run kernel debugging tools.
  - **Examine System Health**: Look at additional logs from Systems (Windows Security, Application, and Sysmon) to assess if there are signs of system compromise or other irregular activities occurring around the same time.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity as invoking the Windows Kernel Debugger can indicate both potential defensive evasion tactics and privilege escalation attempts. However, legitimate instances may occur, necessitating a clear evaluation of the context.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where process monitoring is not adequately set up or if kernel debugging tools are routinely utilized for legitimate purposes, leading to numerous false positives. It assumes that all executions of kd.exe are suspicious, which may not be the case in every enterprise environment. Adversaries may also utilize alternate techniques for debugging that do not invoke the kernel debugger, ultimately bypassing this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This rule is designed to detect potentially malicious behavior involving the execution of Chromium-based browsers in a "headless" modeâ€”specifically targeting instances where the browser is used to connect to URLs associated with the Mockbin service (`mockbin.org` and `run.mocky`). Headless mode allows a browser to run without a graphical user interface, making it ideal for automated tasks, but adversaries can also exploit this feature for data exfiltration or command and control communications. The rule looks for events captured in the process creation logs, where it identifies browser processes such as Brave, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi that are executed with specific command-line arguments (`--headless`) and mentioned URLs. 
  This behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Execution** (T1203), particularly focusing on techniques leveraged by attackers to gain execution capabilities and potentially extract sensitive information from the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation logs for instances of headless Chromium browsers being invoked during the time of the alert. Look for unusual execution patterns or timing that may indicate automated behavior.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line parameters used in the detected processes to confirm the use of the `--headless` flag and URL connections to `mockbin.org` or similar services. This can help confirm if the process was part of an attempted data exfiltration.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to monitor outbound network connections from the identified browser processes. Look for anomalous connections or transfers to external sites that do not follow established behavior.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Cross-reference with other alerts or logs from the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and proxy logs to see if this execution is part of a larger suspicious activity sequence.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is high due to the potential implications of using headless browsers for covert data exfiltration. Chromium-based headless execution in conjunction with specific URLs can signify an active exploitation attempt and therefore demands immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where:
  - The execution occurs on a browser process that is not listed in the detection rule, allowing an attacker to evade detection by utilizing less common browsers or exploits.
  - Malicious commands are executed without the `--headless` flag or using alternative methods, such as leveraging legitimate software mechanisms.
  - There may be valid use cases for headless browser execution in automated environments or by legitimate applications, which may generate false positives.
  Defenders should be aware that sophisticated adversaries could modify their tactics to avoid triggering this detection, such as altering command-line arguments or utilizing other services for data exfiltration.

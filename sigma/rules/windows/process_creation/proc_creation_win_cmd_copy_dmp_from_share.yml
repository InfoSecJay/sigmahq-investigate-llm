  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the unauthorized copying of Windows memory dump files (with extensions .dmp, .dump, or .hdmp) from a remote share using the Windows command line interface (cmd.exe). Memory dump files can contain sensitive information that could be exploited by adversaries to gain credentials or valuable insights about a system. The rule monitors process creation logs, specifically focusing on commands executed via cmd.exe that contain the `copy` command coupled with URLs pointing to remote shares. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic here is "Credential Access," specifically under technique T1552 
  - "Unsecured Credentials." By tracking these activities, security teams can quickly respond to potential data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the Windows Security logs for commands executed from cmd.exe that match the signature of the alert. Focus on the `CommandLine` and `Image` fields to confirm the execution context.
  - **Examine Network Activity:** Use the EDR and NDR tools to analyze network connections made during the time of the alert. Check for connections to known remote share hosts and the associated data transfer volume.
  - **Investigate User Behavior:** Review the user account associated with the suspicious command execution. Validate if the user's account has the legitimate authorization to access the remote share and copy files.
  - **Inspect File Access Logs:** Look into file access logs for the remote share to identify any other suspicious file operations adjacent to the flagged command. This includes checking read/write actions for the specific dump files.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is marked as high because copying memory dump files from a remote share may indicate a significant breach of security that can lead to credential theft and further exploitation. Timely investigations are essential to mitigate a potentially severe attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the command is executed in an alternative way, such as through a different scripting mechanism or if the command is obfuscated. Additionally, if cmd.exe is not monitored, or if the copying action is performed using a privileged account that does not produce standard logs, the rule may fail to capture the event. Engineers should be aware that adversaries can use various techniques to avoid detection, including executing commands from other tools or interfaces that don't trigger the alert.

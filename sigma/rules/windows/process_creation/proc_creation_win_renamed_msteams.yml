  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule, titled "Renamed Microsoft Teams Execution," is designed to identify instances where the Microsoft Teams executable is executed under a potentially malicious renaming scenario. The rule focuses on detecting the execution of files that have the original names, "msteams.exe" or "teams.exe," but are running from paths that do not conform to their legitimate installations. This may indicate an attacker’s attempt to evade detection by disguising malicious activities under the guise of well-known software. 
  The rule leverages process creation logs from Windows, analyzing parameters like the original file name and the image path to differentiate between legitimate and suspect executions. By tracking processes that are initiated with these original file names but sourced from untrusted locations, the alert helps respond to potential defense evasion tactics used by adversaries to compromise systems. This matches the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1203).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Utilize EDR tools to examine recent process creation events related to "msteams.exe" or "teams.exe" and verify if the image paths match legitimate install locations such as "C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams".
  - **Check System for Malicious Variants:** Conduct a search across the environment for any renamed instances or duplicates of the Teams executable, reviewing their hash values against known good binaries.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Inspect any outgoing network connections that were established by the potentially renamed Teams processes using the NDR tool to identify suspicious domains or IP addresses.
  - **Examine User Account Activity:** Investigate the user accounts that executed the renamed binaries, analyzing their activity patterns and any related logs to discern if there’s a potential compromise or insider threat.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium due to the potential risk attached to unauthorized or disguised execution of commonly used applications, which could indicate an attempt to bypass security controls and perform malicious actions in the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker has chosen an entirely different name for the executable that does not resemble the original names or if they execute the binary from a legitimate path. Additionally, variations in legitimate usage patterns of renamed executables by users or misconfigurations in the logging setup may lead to false negatives. The detection logic assumes that the presence of logs is consistent and that legitimate Teams binaries will not typically run from suspicious directories, but this may not cover all adversarial tactics.

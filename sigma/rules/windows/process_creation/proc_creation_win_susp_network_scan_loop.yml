  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Scan Loop Network" Sigma rule is designed to detect potential reconnaissance activities conducted by adversaries seeking to enumerate network resources for lateral movement. Specifically, it focuses on monitoring for the execution of command-line utilities, such as `nslookup` and `ping`, that are often employed in these types of network scans. By identifying patterns of command-line execution that include loops (e.g., using "for" or "foreach"), this rule can signal automated attempts to query information about other systems on the network.
  The rule leverages process creation logs, which provide insights into executed commands and their parameters. This data source is critical in identifying script-driven activities indicative of scanning behavior. The relevant techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework associated with this rule include "T1018: Remote System Discovery," which identifies when an attacker lists other systems on a network as a precursor to lateral movement.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Query the EDR for recent process creation logs that match the detected criteria, focusing on the command-line parameters related to loop structures and scanning tools.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic**: Analyze network traffic logs to check if the identified commands correspond with outbound traffic towards multiple IP addresses or hosts, indicating active scanning.
  - **Investigate Associated User Accounts**: Examine the user accounts associated with the execution of the detected commands to determine if they have legitimate access to perform network scans.
  - **Check for Scheduled Tasks or Scripts**: Audit for any automated tasks or scripts that may have executed the commands, helping distinguish between malicious activity and legitimate administrative tasks.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium priority because while it indicates potential reconnaissance activity that could precede a more serious threat, it may also be the result of legitimate administrative scripts used for network management.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire in instances where scanning tools do not conform to the specified command line patterns, or if the organization uses custom or obfuscated scripts not captured by the rule. Additionally, if the adversary employs less common network enumeration techniques or leverages tools that bypass standard command logging, detection may be hindered. The assumption that legitimate administrative tasks will not mimic the detected behavior also poses a potential for false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - Advanced IP Scanner Execution" is designed to identify the execution of the Advanced IP Scanner application on Windows systems. This tool is often used by cybercriminal groups, particularly in conjunction with ransomware attacks, to perform network reconnaissance. The rule leverages various process creation logs, focusing on specific indicators such as the image path, original file name, and description of the executing process. It employs conditions that match specific command-line parameters that are commonly utilized when running this application, such as `/portable` and `/lng`. These telemetry sources are essential to detecting unauthorized or malicious activity within the network, as they provide insights into process behavior. The rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Discovery tactic (T1075) and the associated technique T1046 â€“ Network Service Scanning.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use the EDR solution to examine process creation logs around the time the alert was triggered. Look for other suspicious processes that might indicate lateral movement or additional reconnaissance activity.
  - **Correlate with Command-Line Arguments**: Assess the command-line arguments provided during the execution of Advanced IP Scanner by investigating Windows Event Logs. This can help verify if the execution context was legitimate or potentially malicious.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic**: Utilize NDR or network firewall logs to identify any unusual network connections originating from the host that executed Advanced IP Scanner. Look for connections to uncommon IP addresses or unexpected outbound traffic patterns.
  - **Check for Related Artifacts**: Investigate Sysmon logs for any related artifacts and connections to additional malicious activity. Pay attention to process access attempts and any file modifications that occurred around the same timeframe.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium due to the tool's legitimate use cases; however, its association with ransomware and reconnaissance makes it a potential vector for compromise, necessitating further investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the Advanced IP Scanner application is being executed in a way that generates process creation logs in line with standard logging practices. It may not fire if the application is run with obfuscated command-line arguments or if process visibility is compromised due to restrictive logging policies. Additionally, some legitimate administrative tasks might trigger false positives, hence a context-based analysis is crucial. Adversaries could also create custom versions of the tool that evade detection.

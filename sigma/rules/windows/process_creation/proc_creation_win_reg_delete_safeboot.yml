  ### Technical Context
  The "SafeBoot Registry Key Deleted Via Reg.EXE" rule is designed to detect malicious attempts to disable security mechanisms on a Windows system by monitoring the execution of the `reg.exe` command-line utility. Specifically, it looks for instances where `reg.exe` is executed with the "delete" flag targeting the SafeBoot registry keys, located at `\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot`. The deletion of these keys can prevent the system from entering Safe Mode, an important troubleshooting and recovery feature often utilized by security products. This rule uses Windows process creation logs as its primary data source to identify when `reg.exe` is executed with the malicious intent of altering critical security functionality. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001, which covers defense evasion tactics employed by malicious actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Examine the endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for any recent executions of `reg.exe`, focusing specifically on command-line arguments that indicate deletion actions targeting SafeBoot keys.
  - **Analyze Process Tree:** Use the EDR to inspect the process tree for the instance of `reg.exe` to understand the context and identify any parent processes that may have spawned it.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference the findings with other data sources, such as Windows Event Logs (Security, Application) and Sysmon logs, to gather any additional information about the user's actions leading up to the registry modification.
  - **Verify Impact on System:** Check system functionality and security product states to determine if any effects have arisen due to the deletion activity, and assess the potential risk to the environment.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is tagged with a high severity level because altering the SafeBoot registry keys poses a significant threat to the organizationâ€™s security posture, enabling evasion of security products and increasing vulnerability to attacks.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker uses alternative methods to delete the SafeBoot keys, such as using a different tool or employing local scripts that do not go through `reg.exe`. Additionally, it assumes that all relevant telemetry sources are being monitored effectively; if certain logs are not enabled or collected, this rule could fail to detect malicious activity. It's also important to note that legitimate administrative actions might inadvertently trigger the rule if they involve the deletion of these registry keys without proper contextual verification.

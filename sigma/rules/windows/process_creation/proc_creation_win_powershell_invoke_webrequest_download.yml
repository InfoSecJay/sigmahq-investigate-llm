  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for suspicious executions of the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet within Windows environments, specifically focusing on instances where the output of such commands is directed to locations that may be indicative of malicious activity. The rule searches for process creation logs to identify the execution of PowerShell commands (including aliases such as `curl` and `wget`) where the command line arguments include options that could lead to potentially harmful downloads or file manipulations. Key indicators include unusual output redirection to common but potentially unsecured directories such as `AppData`, `Desktop`, `Temp`, and others. The MITRE ATT&CK technique being addressed here is T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer), which is utilized by attackers to transfer files into the target environment, often to deploy malicious payloads.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs during the timeframe of the alert to identify the user account associated with the suspicious command execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the specific command-line parameters used with `Invoke-WebRequest`, looking for patterns such as redirection to unusual directories or combinations of arguments that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Check network connections via firewall or network detection tools to see if there were any outbound connections made to untrusted domains coinciding with the timing of the `Invoke-WebRequest` executions.
  - **Inspect File and Folder Changes:** Assess the contents of the suspicious locations (e.g., `Temp`, `AppData`) for newly created or modified files that may correlate with the commands executed.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized file downloads and execution within the environment, highlighting an active exploit attempt which could lead to further compromise.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in situations where the adversary uses obfuscation techniques to hide the command-line arguments or employs other tools that do not invoke PowerShell, such as alternative scripting languages or executables. Additionally, legitimate automated systems using PowerShell for benign tasks may inadvertently generate false positives. It is assumed that the telemetry configurations are adequately capturing all relevant process creation activities; a failure to do so may lead to missed detections.

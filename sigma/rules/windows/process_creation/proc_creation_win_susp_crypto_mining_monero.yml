  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential Crypto Mining Activity" rule is designed to detect suspicious command-line arguments typically associated with cryptocurrency mining software. This rule analyzes process creation events on Windows systems, specifically looking for command-line strings that indicate the presence of crypto miners, such as parameters that set CPU priority, donation levels, and pool configurations commonly used by mining software. By leveraging Sysmon logs, the rule captures relevant command-line inputs, which allows SOC analysts to identify unauthorized mining activities on the corporate network. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1496 (Resource Hijacking), which focuses on adversaries using victim resources for cryptomining without consent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR alerts:** Review EDR logs for the detected process creation events. Look into any flagged processes to determine their legitimacy and origin.
  - **Analyze command-line parameters:** Investigate the command-line arguments associated with the detected processes. Pay attention to patterns indicating crypto mining, such as connections to known mining pools or the presence of donation flags.
  - **Review network connections:** Use network telemetry from the firewall (NGFW) to identify outbound connections made by the detected processes. Look for suspicious external pools that may correlate with mining activities.
  - **Correlate with user activity:** Examine user access logs (such as VPN or proxy logs) to determine if the behavior is in line with legitimate activities. Consult with the user to gather context on the executable being flagged.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of the alert is marked as high due to the potential for unauthorized use of the organization's computing resources, which can lead to financial loss, degraded system performance, and increased security risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not detect crypto mining activities that use obfuscated command-line parameters or those executed via legitimate software that functions as a cover. Additionally, if mining activities are disguised within other legitimate applications or executed by privileged accounts, there may be a higher likelihood of evasion. Furthermore, variations in mining software and continuously evolving tactics might lead to false negatives, meaning adversaries could successfully hide their actions.

  Detects the enabling of the Windows Recall feature via registry manipulation.
  Windows Recall can be enabled by deleting the existing "DisableAIDataAnalysis" value, or setting it to 0.
  Adversaries may enable Windows Recall as part of post-exploitation discovery and collection activities.
  This rule assumes that Recall is already explicitly disabled on the host, and subsequently enabled by the adversary.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Windows Recall Feature Enabled Via Reg.EXE" is designed to identify the enabling of the Windows Recall feature through registry manipulation, which can be indicative of post-exploitation activities by adversaries. The rule specifically detects actions involving the registry path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI\DisableAIDataAnalysis`, where the value for "DisableAIDataAnalysis" must be altered. This is accomplished by either deleting the existing value or setting it to 0 via the `reg.exe` utilityâ€”a common tool used for registry modifications on Windows systems. The primary data sources leveraged for detection include process creation logs, focusing on the execution of `reg.exe` and the associated command-line parameters. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Collection" and specifically addresses the technique of "Data from Information Repositories" (T1113), highlighting its importance in recognizing suspicious changes in system configurations that may facilitate information gathering.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:** Use EDR to confirm the execution of `reg.exe` around the time of the alert. Examine the process tree to determine if the execution context indicates suspicious behavior or unauthorized user account usage.
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Inspect the relevant registry paths to verify if changes were made to the `DisableAIDataAnalysis` value on affected hosts. Ensure to note any changes made shortly before the alert was triggered, including timestamps and user accounts involved.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Analyze network logs for any unusual activities that might correlate with the time of the registry changes. Specifically, check for outbound connections or data transfers initiated post-execution of `reg.exe`.
  - **Investigate User Access:** Look into user access logs to understand who modified the registry and from which machine. Identify if the user has any historical malicious actions or if their access level aligns with their role.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for abuse by adversaries seeking to gather sensitive information. The enabling of the Windows Recall feature can lead to significant data exposure, particularly if conducted on compromised systems or by unauthorized users.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where the Windows Recall feature is already enabled or if legitimate administrative changes are made without malicious intent. Additionally, if an adversary employs different techniques to manipulate the registry without using `reg.exe`, such as through PowerShell or other scripting languages, the rule would not capture those activities. Engineers should be aware that variations in command-line arguments or non-standard execution methods could prevent detection.

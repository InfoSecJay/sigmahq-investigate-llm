  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed Vmnat.exe Execution" detection rule aims to identify instances where the legitimate executable file `vmnat.exe`—which is associated with VMware's NAT functionality—has been renamed or is being used in an unexpected context, particularly to facilitate DLL sideloading. This can indicate potential evasion tactics by adversaries looking to execute malicious payloads under the guise of a benign process. The rule leverages process creation logs to monitor new instances of this executable while checking the original filename to ensure it matches `vmnat.exe`. Furthermore, it filters for variations of the image name (renaming scenarios) to catch any renamed copies that might be employed by attackers. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and specifically the technique T1574.002 (Rename System Utilities).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts for any suspicious behaviors associated with the identified `vmnat.exe` processes, looking for unusual parent processes or command-line parameters.
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Investigate the process tree related to the alerting instance to determine the lineage of the process creation and identify any anomalous parent processes that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Investigate Network Activity:** Use network logs to analyze outbound connections from the identified process. Unsanctioned data exfiltration attempts or connections to known malicious IPs may indicate compromise.
  - **Review Recent Changes:** Check change logs in the Windows security logs to identify any recent system alterations that may correlate with the execution of the potentially malicious renamed executable.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of an attacker using a renamed legitimate executable to bypass defenses, combined with the risk of malicious DLL execution, which could compromise the host system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the renamed executable is invoked in a method not captured by process creation logs, such as being executed through alternate means like WMI or via scripts. Additionally, instances where legitimate users manipulate the `vmnat.exe` executable for valid reasons could lead to false positives. It is also assumed that the execution context will be sufficiently logged for detection to occur; environments with aggressive log retention policies or limited monitoring might miss these events.

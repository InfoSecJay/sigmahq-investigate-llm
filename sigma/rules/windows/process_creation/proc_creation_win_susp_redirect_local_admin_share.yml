  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential malicious activity where processes redirect outputs to the local administrative share (admin$). Such behavior is commonly seen in exploitative scripts and malicious tools utilized to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. The rule relies on monitoring process creation logs and examines command-line parameters to flag instances where commands attempt to pipe output to the administrative share on localhost (127.0.0.1). Specifically, it looks for command lines containing redirection symbols (e.g., '>') and references to the local admin share paths (e.g., '\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\' or '\\\\localhost\\admin$\\'). This activity is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques under the tactic of Exfiltration (T1048).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Events**: Utilize the EDR to retrieve historical event data associated with the detected process, including process parent-child relationships, to understand the context of the command execution.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments**: Analyze the full command-line parameters in the process creation logs to identify patterns or additional indicators of compromise that could assist in understanding the intent behind the execution.
  - **Inspect the Administrative Share**: Examine access logs for the admin$ share to determine if there were additional or unauthorized accesses around the time of the alert, which could signify malicious activity.
  - **Check for Malware Artifacts**: Use the AV and other security tools to scan the system for known malicious scripts or tools that might have been used to execute the suspicious commands.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the nature of activities involving redirection to administrative shares, which often indicate attempts at data exfiltration or other malicious intents within an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where command-line redirection to the local share is legitimate, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, it assumes that command-line logging is enabled and that the necessary telemetry is being captured continuously. Adversaries may also evade detection by utilizing legitimate system administration tools that do not display suspicious command-line patterns or by executing commands from compromised user accounts with sufficient privileges.

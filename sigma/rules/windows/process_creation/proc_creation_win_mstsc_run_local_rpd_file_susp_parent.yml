  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Mstsc.EXE Execution From Uncommon Parent" is designed to detect unauthorized use of the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) through the execution of `mstsc.exe` from uncommon parent processes. This behavior can be indicative of an adversary attempting to establish initial access or lateral movement within a network using a remote desktop configuration file (".rdp") that may have been placed in suspicious locations. The rule focuses on process creation logs, specifically targeting instances where `mstsc.exe` is launched by known web browsers or email clients, suggesting potential nefarious downloads or user interaction with malicious content.
  Key data sources leveraged by the rule include Windows process creation logs, which track the execution of processes and their associated parent processes. This allows for the identification of instances where `mstsc.exe` is executed without typical user interaction or contexts. The rule is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for **Lateral Movement**, specifically under the technique **T1135: RDP**. By monitoring such executions, this rule aids in the early detection of potential compromised systems that may be leveraged for unauthorized access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **EDR Analysis**: Investigate the specific endpoint where the alert was triggered, examining the EDR logs for additional context around the execution of `mstsc.exe`, including timestamps, associated user accounts, and any prior suspicious activities.
  - **Process Tree Exploration**: Utilize EDR tools to view the process tree associated with `mstsc.exe`. Identify the parent process and examine its execution path to establish whether it originated from an expected or expected location.
  - **Network Traffic Review**: Analyze network logs for unusual outbound connections created around the same time as the execution of `mstsc.exe`. Look for any connections that may indicate a remote session initiated with an unfamiliar or suspicious IP address.
  - **RDP File Inspection**: If applicable, retrieve and inspect the `.rdp` file involved to determine its contents and the destination address it is pointing toward. This helps ascertain whether the file is authentic or potentially malicious.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity because the use of `mstsc.exe` from an uncommon or unexpected parent process could signal a potential breach or misuse of RDP access, which poses significant risks to the integrity and confidentiality of enterprise systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that the execution of `mstsc.exe` may indicate malicious behavior only when it is invoked by uncommon parent processes. However, it may not fire in scenarios where legitimate RDP sessions are initiated, such as from trusted applications or scheduled tasks. Additionally, attackers may utilize obfuscation techniques or alternative remote access tools to evade detection, such as using cmdlets in PowerShell for remote administration or creating custom scripts to initiate RDP sessions without triggering the monitored paths.

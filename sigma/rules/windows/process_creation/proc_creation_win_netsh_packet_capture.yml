  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential misuse of the `netsh.exe` utility on Windows systems, specifically when it is executed with the "trace" flag to initiate a network capture. Network capture capabilities are often used by system administrators for legitimate purposes, such as troubleshooting connectivity issues. However, they can also be employed by adversaries to gather sensitive information about network traffic, thereby enabling credential theft or reconnaissance. 
  The rule relies primarily on process creation logs to monitor the execution of `netsh.exe` and examines the command-line arguments provided. It checks for two key components: the presence of the application name (`netsh.exe`) and the command-line flags `trace` and `start`. This approach allows the SOC to detect potentially unauthorized or suspicious network tracing activities that may correlate with tactics and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the Discovery and Credential Access tactics (Techniques T1040).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze Windows Event Logs, specifically the Security and Sysmon logs, for instances of `netsh.exe` being executed with the "trace start" command, taking note of the user context under which the command was run.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Use EDR tools to assess the behavior of the user account associated with the `netsh.exe` execution. Look for other suspicious activities or anomalies that may indicate a compromised account.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Utilize network logs from your NDR or firewall to examine traffic patterns at the time the capture was initiated. Look for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration that may coincide with the network trace.
  - **Authenticate Against Normal Baseline:** Compare the detected activity against normal operational baselines for the environment. If the execution aligns with known administrative duties or scheduled tasks, validate the legitimacy before escalating.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is medium, indicating that while there are legitimate use cases for capturing network traces, the presence of this activity can signal potential reconnaissance or data harvesting by malicious actors. Investigating such occurrences is crucial for ensuring the security posture of the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the execution of `netsh.exe` with the "trace" flag is not a common activity among legitimate users and that proper logging is enabled in the environment. Potential blind spots include scenarios where logging is insufficient, such as if Sysmon is not deployed or if process creation logging is disabled. Additionally, advanced adversaries may obfuscate the command-line parameters used, potentially evading detection if they choose to manipulate `netsh.exe` in non-standard ways.

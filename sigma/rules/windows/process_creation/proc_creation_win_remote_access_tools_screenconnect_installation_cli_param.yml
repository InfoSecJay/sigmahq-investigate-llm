  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the installation execution of ScreenConnect, a remote access tool commonly used for legitimate remote support as well as for malicious purposes. It specifically looks for process creation events where the command line parameters contain certain patterns indicative of a ScreenConnect session initiation, such as those associated with guest access and specific session keys. The technical data sources involved in this detection are Windows process creation logs, with the command line parameters being a primary focus to identify abnormal or unauthorized use of this remote access tool. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for "Initial Access" (T1133), which involves the exploitation of system capabilities to gain access to target environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Source:** Review the source of the ScreenConnect process from the EDR tool to verify whether it originates from a legitimate administrative action or if the process appears anomalous based on the user and system context.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Inspect the full command line arguments for any signs of atypical behavior, such as unexpected parameters or integration with suspicious URL patterns that could indicate a malicious use case.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Investigate the user activity logs to determine whether the actions taken leading up to the ScreenConnect execution are consistent with authorized administrative functions or possibly indicative of credential compromise.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Utilize network detection tools to examine outbound connections initiated by the ScreenConnect process. Look for anomalous connections, especially to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts for the execution of ScreenConnect should be considered medium severity due to the legitimate use cases within administrative contexts; however, given its potential for misuse in unauthorized access, any alert should prompt immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection may not trigger if the ScreenConnect application is executed in ways that do not use the typical command line parameters specified in the rule or if obfuscation methods are applied to hide the execution pattern. Additionally, there is an assumption that all relevant logs are being collected uniformly; instances of process creation may go unnoticed if logging mechanisms fail or are misconfigured, leaving potential malicious activity undetected.

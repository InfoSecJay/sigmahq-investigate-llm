  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies the execution of "gpg.exe" or "gpg2.exe" from locations that are not considered standard or common installations. GnuPG’s OpenPGP tool, often associated with legitimate cryptographic tasks, has been increasingly exploited by adversaries, especially in ransomware operations where it is used to encrypt or decrypt files. The rule leverages process creation logs, specifically focusing on the "Image" field to capture the file name and location, along with "OriginalFileName" and "Description" fields to verify the legitimacy of the executable. By filtering out known legitimate locations (such as the typical installation paths for GnuPG), the rule prioritizes instances where the tool is launched from potentially suspect or uncommon directories, thereby enhancing detection of malicious activities that align with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for "Data Encrypted for Impact" (T1486).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs for process creation events associated with gpg.exe or gpg2.exe. Pay close attention to the file path and the user context under which it was executed.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Use your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to investigate the system where the execution occurred. Look for any related anomalies, such as additional suspicious processes or file modifications leading up to the event.
  - **Examine File Details:** Validate the legitimacy of the executed file by checking the hash against known repositories or threat intelligence databases. Evaluate whether the file matches the expected criteria for authorized software installations.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Investigate any network connections established by the process using Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools. Identify any suspicious outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts associated with the gpg.exe execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity of this alert indicates a moderate risk to the organization, as the execution of gpg.exe from uncommon locations may signify potential malicious behaviors, such as encryption by ransomware. Immediate investigation is warranted to determine intentions and impact.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if gpg.exe is executed from a legitimate or commonly accepted path that has not been included in the filter. Additionally, if an adversary has the capability to change file properties or if they have managed to place gpg.exe in allowed locations disguised as a benign file, the detection may fail. Analysts should remain aware of legitimate applications that may use GnuPG for encryption or decryption functionalities and consider potential false positives in those cases.

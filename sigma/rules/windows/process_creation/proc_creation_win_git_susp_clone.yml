  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Git Clone" Sigma rule is designed to detect potential reconnaissance activities by monitoring for the execution of Git commands that may involve cloning remote repositories containing suspicious keywords. When a process is initiated that utilizes Git or its associated executables, such as `git.exe` or `git-remote-https.exe`, the rule examines the command-line parameters associated with that process. Specifically, it looks for the presence of terms related to security vulnerabilities, exploits, or other malicious activities, such as "exploit," "vulnerability," "CVE-," and more. This monitoring primarily leverages process creation logs within Windows, enabling detection of unauthorized or anomalous behavior that aligns with tactics related to reconnaissance in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically T1593.003.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Investigate the process creation logs for instances of `git.exe` or `git-remote-https.exe`, especially focusing on the command-line arguments to identify if they contain any suspicious keywords.
  - **Cross-Reference Command-Line Parameters:** Use EDR tools to correlate any suspicious command-line parameters with user activity logs to assess whether the action was legitimate or part of an attack campaign.
  - **Check External Network Connections:** Analyze outbound network connections initiated by the detected Git processes for any connections to suspicious or known malicious domains using firewall and proxy logs.
  - **Inspect User Context and Access:** Examine the context in which the command was run (e.g., user accounts, privileges) and correlate this with existing access controls and user permissions to identify potential misuse.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level of this alert suggests that while the detection of suspicious Git activities may indicate potential reconnaissance efforts, it does not automatically imply successful exploitation or a breach. However, such behaviors should be prioritized for investigation due to the potential for lead-up to more significant attacks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary utilizes non-standard command names or obfuscates command-line arguments (e.g., using alternative Git executables or scripts). Additionally, if the suspicious activity does not align perfectly with the defined keywords, the detection could be ineffective. There is also an assumption that all relevant telemetries are correctly collected and processed within the SIEM. Analysts should remain aware that perpetrators may use legitimate Git commands for benign purposes, leading to potential false positives.

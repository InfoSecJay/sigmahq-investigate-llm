status: stable
description: Detects the use of the bcdedit command to tamper with the boot configuration
  data. This technique is often times used by malware or attackers as a destructive
  way before launching ransomware.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potentially malicious activity involving the `bcdedit.exe` utility, which is used to manipulate the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) in Windows environments. Adversaries often leverage this command-line tool to corrupt or alter boot settings as a preparatory step before deploying ransomware or to disrupt system recovery features. The detection logic specifically monitors for process creation events where `bcdedit.exe` is executed, focusing on command-line arguments that indicate tampering with boot policies, such as enabling boot status policies or disabling recovery options. This functionality utilizes Windows Event Logs as the primary data source, particularly monitoring the process creation logs originating from the Sysmon and Windows Event Log formats.
  In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this detection relates to the **Impact** tactic (TA0040) and specifically addresses the technique **T1490: Inhibit System Recovery**, indicating that the activity could lead to significant operational impact.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Alert Source:** Check the EDR solution for the presence of the `bcdedit.exe` execution and its associated command-line arguments, correlating the events with the alert timestamp.
  - **User Context Review:** Examine the user account executing the command to determine if the context is legitimate (e.g., administrative access) or suspicious. Investigate recent logins and activities by this user across the network.
  - **Assess System Integrity:** Utilize Windows Security logs to evaluate any recent alterations to system policies or recovery settings, along with other process creation logs around the same time for anomalous behavior.
  - **Threat Intelligence Correlation:** Cross-reference the identified user and machine with threat intelligence feeds to check for known malicious IPs, hashes, or behaviors related to ransomware or other malware obfuscation methods.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as **high severity** because modification of boot configuration can severely impact system recovery capabilities, indicating a potential prelude to a ransomware attack that could result in significant operational disruption and data loss.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where:
  - The `bcdedit.exe` utility is obfuscated under a different name or executed with elevated privileges that evade monitoring.
  - The command is executed in a non-standard environment that does not log process creation events effectively.
  - Adversaries may leverage scripts or automation tools that execute `bcdedit.exe` without standard monitoring being triggered.
  Additionally, it assumes the environmental logging settings are correctly configured to capture the required process creation events adequately.

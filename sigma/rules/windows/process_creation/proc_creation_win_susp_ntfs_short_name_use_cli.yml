  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Use NTFS Short Name in Command Line" targets the use of Windows 8.3 short names, which are abbreviated file names created for backward compatibility with older operating systems. Attackers might exploit these short names to bypass security controls and detection mechanisms that rely on command-line arguments, mapping them instead to less recognizable short names. This rule monitors for instances in process creation logs where the command line includes references to these short names, such as `~1.exe` or `~2.exe`, indicating potential evasion tactics under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (Technique T1564.004). The primary data source utilized for this detection is the Windows process creation logs, which capture command-line parameters used when processes are launched.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the EDR platform for alerts related to the detected process creation events. Analyze the contextual metadata, including the user account, host, and execution time.
  - **Examine Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command line of the flagged process to confirm the presence of Windows short names. Compare against known legitimate applications that may occasionally use these names.
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Evaluate the parent processes of the detected instances, especially those listed in the filter, such as `WebexHost.exe` and `thor64.exe`, to understand the potential cause of the usage.
  - **Check Network Logs:** Look at network connections initiated by suspicious processes in the EDR or NDR logs. Determine if there are outbound connections or communications with known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium as the usage of NTFS short names can indicate an attempt to evade detection but isn't definitive proof of malicious intent. It warrants investigation to understand the context and legitimacy of the detected processes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule effectively detects the use of NTFS short names, it may not fire in scenarios where legitimate applications output these short names in their command line. Additionally, if an attacker crafts commands using fully qualified names or avoids the typical short name patterns altogether, the rule would fail to trigger. Analysts should recognize that some applications legitimately use 8.3 filenames, which may generate false positives, necessitating thorough investigation of both the parent and child processes to ascertain intent.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious activity involving the execution of **rundll32.exe** with the specific command `desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver`. This command allows executable files, specifically a screen saver (SCR file), to be run as a dynamic link library (DLL) execution. Attackers may leverage this mechanism to execute malicious code while masquerading as a benign system process, thus evading traditional security measures. The rule primarily analyzes **process creation logs** in Windows environments, focusing on the command line parameters and the image name of the process initiated. When the command line contains the specific instruction related to the installation of a screensaver and the process executed is **rundll32.exe**, it triggers an alert for potential malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the **Process Creation Logs** in the EDR tool to confirm the execution path of **rundll32.exe** and the related command line parameters to establish the context of the execution.
  - Utilize **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** capabilities to trace the process tree and identify any child processes spawned by the **rundll32.exe** execution to uncover potentially malicious activity.
  - Examine relevant **proxy logs** to detect any unusual outbound connections made by the system after the execution of the command, as this may indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server.
  - Check for any alerts or detections raised by the **Anti-Virus (AV)** solution related to the execution of **rundll32.exe**; legitimate antivirus warnings can provide insight into the nature of the executable and its behavior.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Rundll32 InstallScreenSaver Execution" Sigma rule detects a method of executing potentially malicious code via the Windows utility `rundll32.exe`. This technique may be leveraged by attackers to run applications under the guise of a standard Windows component, specifically targeting the `desk.cpl` library to execute the `InstallScreenSaver` function. The detection mechanism involves monitoring process creation logs to identify instances where `rundll32.exe` is executed with command-line parameters suggesting an intent to manipulate screen savers, which is an uncommon but possible method for executing payloads and evading detection. This behavior is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218.011 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution) and is categorized under the Defense Evasion tactic. The primarily involved data sources include process creation logs, Sysmon telemetry, and command-line parameters.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review process creation events for any instances of `rundll32.exe` being invoked, particularly those containing the `desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver` command-line parameters.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command line used for the execution of `rundll32.exe` to identify any additional suspicious arguments or behaviors indicative of nefarious activity.
  - **Review Related Sysmon Events:** Investigate Sysmon logs for additional related events, such as network connections or file modifications performed by the process, which may reveal further malicious actions.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference findings with threat intelligence databases and logs to determine if similar execution patterns have been reported and identified as malicious in other organizations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level as it signifies unusual execution of a Windows component that could indicate an attempt to evade detection while executing potentially harmful payloads. It warrants prompt investigation to assess whether legitimate use or malicious activity is occurring.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if an attacker modifies their command-line parameters to use a variant of the legitimate command or employs other evasion techniques like obfuscation. Additionally, legitimate screen saver installations may generate similar logs, resulting in false positives. It's also assumed that monitoring for process creation logs is adequately configured and comprehensive within the enterprise environment.

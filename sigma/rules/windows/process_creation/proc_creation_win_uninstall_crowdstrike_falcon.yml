  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Uninstall Crowdstrike Falcon Sensor" is designed to detect the uninstallation of the Crowdstrike Falcon endpoint protection software, which may indicate malicious activity aimed at evading detection mechanisms in an enterprise environment. Specifically, the rule identifies process creation events where the command line arguments contain references to the `WindowsSensor.exe` executable paired with the `/uninstall` and `/quiet` flags. The leveraged data sources for this detection include process creation logs, which record details about new processes initiated on Windows systems, including their command-line arguments.
  This detection rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion," specifically technique T1562.001, which covers the removal of security tools to obstruct visibility into an adversary's actions. By capturing targeted uninstallation requests, it enables the SOC to identify potential attempts by attackers to disable critical security measures within the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Review the process creation logs in your EDR tool for instances of `WindowsSensor.exe` being executed with the `/uninstall` and `/quiet` parameters to confirm the alert.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Investigate the context surrounding the process creation event by reviewing user account activity and login/logout events to ascertain whether the action was legitimate or potentially unauthorized.
  - **Analyze System and Security Logs**: Examine Windows Security or System logs to identify any related events that may provide additional context, such as other security agents being disabled or altered configurations.
  - **Review Network Traffic**: Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to analyze any outbound connections subsequent to the uninstallation action to determine if there was any unusual or malicious communication initiated by the host.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity because the uninstallation of security tools such as Crowdstrike Falcon can significantly increase the risk of undetected malicious activities within the enterprise. Timely investigation is crucial to mitigate potential threats to the organization's security posture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule assumes that all legitimate uninstallations of the Crowdstrike Falcon Sensor would be preceded by proper administrative activity; however, it may miss instances where uninstallations are performed via other means or command-line parameters not accounted for in the pattern. Additionally, if an adversary uses obfuscation techniques or modifies the command-line execution, the rule may fail to trigger. It is essential for detection engineers to be aware of these limitations and augment detection capabilities to cover potential attack vectors that could bypass this rule.

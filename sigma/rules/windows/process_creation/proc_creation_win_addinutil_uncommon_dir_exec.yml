  ### Technical Context
  The "AddinUtil.EXE Execution From Uncommon Directory" Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the Add-In deployment cache updating utility (AddinUtil.exe) from non-standard directories. Typically, AddinUtil.exe resides in directories associated with Windows .NET Framework installations (such as `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\` or `C:\Windows\WinSxS\`). This rule leverages Windows process creation logs to identify when this utility is executed from unexpected or uncommon paths, which could indicate malicious activity or the exploitation of a living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin). 
  By monitoring the `Image` property in process creation logs, which indicates the path of the running executable, and the `OriginalFileName` property, the rule can differentiate between legitimate usage and potentially harmful execution in non-standard contexts. This behavior correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), aiming to highlight any evasion tactics employed by adversaries to execute malicious code using legitimate binaries.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Use your EDR solution to review the process creation logs for instances of AddinUtil.exe being executed from paths that do not match known legitimate directories.
  - **Analyze File Path Patterns**: Investigate the directory from which AddinUtil.exe is executed to identify any unusual or uncommon file paths that may suggest evasion tactics.
  - **Review Parent Process Logs**: Examine the parent process linked to the execution of AddinUtil.exe to determine how it was invoked and if it exhibits suspicious behavior or originates from an unauthorized application.
  - **Cross-Reference Security Events**: Utilize Windows Security logs to find any related security events that occurred around the same time as the execution, providing context and further layers of investigation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity because the execution of a common utility from an uncommon directory may signify an attempt to bypass security measures. While not always indicative of a compromise, it warrants investigation to ensure threat actors are not exploiting legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if AddinUtil.exe is executed from a legitimate directory after being moved or if the directory structure has changed, thus creating a blind spot for detection. Additionally, if an attacker renames or modifies AddinUtil.exe or uses a different binary with similar functionalities, the rule may not trigger. The assumption is that administrators maintain standard directory structures for legitimate applications, which may not hold true in all environments.

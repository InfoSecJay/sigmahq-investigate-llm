  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the use of the PowerShell `Get-Clipboard` cmdlet executed via the command line interface (CLI). The rule examines process creation logs to capture command-line arguments and looks specifically for any instances where `Get-Clipboard` is utilized. This is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1115 (Clipboard Data) within the Collection tactic, as attackers may exploit the clipboard to gather sensitive information from compromised systems. By aggregating the process creation data, this rule can highlight potentially unwanted or malicious usage patterns, which might indicate an attempt to access confidential data.
  The detection rule is implemented using telemetry from Windows process creation events. It focuses on the `CommandLine` field, checking for the presence of the string `Get-Clipboard`. As such, incident responders should be particularly alert to alerts generated around unusual or unauthorized usage of this cmdlet, as it may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data or pivot within a compromised network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in the EDR to identify all processes that executed the `Get-Clipboard` command. Pay attention to the parent process and the user context under which it was executed.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Context:** Look into the complete command-line arguments used during invocation. This can provide insights into what data was attempted to be accessed or manipulated and may reveal suspicious patterns.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check the user activity logs from the Security logs to determine if the user has a valid reason to use `Get-Clipboard`. Verify if the user typically performs actions that would necessitate clipboard access.
  - **Inspect for Lateral Movement Indicators:** Use network logs and proxy logs to see if there's any related suspicious outbound traffic that follows the clipboard access. This can help confirm if the clipboard operation coincided with potential data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is rated medium severity because while the use of `Get-Clipboard` can have benign legitimate applications, its invocation can also signal an attempt to gather sensitive information, making it essential to investigate.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several considerations regarding potential blind spots with this rule. The main assumption is that all instances of `Get-Clipboard` usage are recorded. However, sophisticated adversaries may employ techniques to evade detection, such as using alternate methods to manipulate the clipboard or running the command in contexts that do not generate logs. Additionally, it is possible for benign applications or scripts to trigger this detection erroneously, leading to false positives. As such, complex environments with a high volume of legitimate PowerShell usage may see noise from this rule.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the accidental use of Cobalt Strike modules within a Windows command shell (CMD). Cobalt Strike is a legitimate tool often used for penetration testing, but its modules can also be exploited by adversaries in unauthorized actions. The rule targets command-line parameters that include specific Cobalt Strike commands, such as `Invoke-UserHunter` and `Invoke-Kerberoast`, and it checks for their execution through the `cmd.exe` process or its variations. By focusing on process creation logs, the rule captures these command line entries, allowing SOC analysts to detect potential attacks or misconfigurations involving this powerful tool.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in your EDR platform to identify instances of `cmd.exe` executing the specific Cobalt Strike commands listed in the rule.
  - Analyze the command-line parameters associated with each detected process for irregular usage patterns or suspicious activity that could indicate malicious intent.
  - Cross-reference detected events with firewall logs and proxy logs to determine if there was any external communication related to these command executions.
  - Check user activity logs to understand the context of the command execution, identifying if it was performed by a legitimate user or an unauthorized entity.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential unauthorized copying of sensitive credential files in a Windows environment. It looks for the execution of Esentutl.exe, a legitimate utility for managing database files, which may be misused by adversaries to access and copy sensitive files containing credential data, such as SAM and NTDS.dit files. The rule employs process creation logs to capture relevant behaviors, specifically focusing on command-line arguments and paths associated with credential data. If Esentutl.exe is invoked with specific parameters indicative of misuse—such as accessing Windows backup files or system files related to user credentials—it will trigger this alert. Incorporating detection logic aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this rule pertains to the **Credential Access** tactic (T1003), particularly techniques for credential dumping.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin**: Check the source of the Esentutl.exe execution via EDR to confirm if it originated from a legitimate system directory or if it appears suspicious in context.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Review the command-line parameters used with Esentutl.exe in the process creation logs for any signs of malicious intent, such as requests to copy sensitive backup files.
  - **Query Incident Activity**: Investigate any prior alerts associated with the same host or user account within the SIEM to determine if this action is part of a broader pattern of potentially malicious behavior.
  - **Check File Integrity**: Utilize file integrity monitoring tools to assess if the sensitive files (e.g., SAM, NTDS.dit) were recently accessed, copied, or modified, and correlate findings with the observed process activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level assigned to this alert, it indicates a significant potential risk to the security posture of the organization, as unauthorized access to credential files could facilitate further lateral movement or privilege escalation by an attacker.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that Esentutl.exe will be invoked with recognizable command-line patterns when copying sensitive files. It may not fire if adversaries use alternative methods or tools that mimic legitimate processes, or if they execute commands in a way that circumvents monitoring (e.g., through obfuscation). There is also an inherent limitation if legitimate use cases arise that mirror these suspicious activities, such as authorized backup operations performed by web admins or forensic analysts.

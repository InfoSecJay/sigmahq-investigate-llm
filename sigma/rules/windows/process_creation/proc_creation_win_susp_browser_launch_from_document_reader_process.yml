title: Potential Suspicious Browser Launch From Document Reader Process
id: 1193d960-2369-499f-a158-7b50a31df682
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects when a browser process or browser tab is launched from an application that handles document files such as Adobe, Microsoft Office, etc. And connects to a web application over http(s), this could indicate a possible phishing attempt.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activity when a web browser is launched from a document-handling application such as Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office. The rule monitors process creation events, specifically looking for instances where a browser process—like Chrome or Firefox—is spawned by document reader applications. This behavior could indicate a phishing attempt if the browser is directed to a suspicious URL (identified by the command line containing 'http'). The rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic `Execution` and the technique `T1204.002`, which involves user execution of malicious content.
  The data sources leveraged for this detection include Windows Sysmon's process creation logs, focusing on the `ParentImage`, `Image`, and `CommandLine` parameters to spot suspicious relationships between document readers and web browsers. If a browser opens as a result of a document reading application process, especially with a command line that includes 'http', it raises a flag for further examination.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Chain:** Verify the process tree using EDR tools to confirm that the suspicious browser process originated from a legitimate document reader. Look for any anomalies in the parent-child relationship.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Inspect the command line used to launch the browser from the process creation logs. Pay close attention to the URLs being accessed and any flags that may indicate abnormal behavior.
  - **Review Web Traffic:** Utilize proxy or network logs to investigate the destination of the URL accessed via the browser. Assess if the endpoint is known, trusted, or potentially malicious.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity:** Check if the user interacted with any attachment or document at the time of the alert using Security or Application logs. Correlate this with the document file types they were handling.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential of indicating a phishing attempt, which can lead to credential theft or malware infection. While it does not confirm malicious intent outright, it warrants immediate review to assess the risk to the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger in cases where:
  - The document reader application doesn't spawn a browser directly or uses a different method (e.g., opening in a non-standard browser).
  - Users have legitimate reasons for opening browsers from document applications, such as accessing specific links in PDF or Office documents.
  Additionally, if the browser is configured to suppress command-line arguments, critical indicators may be missed.

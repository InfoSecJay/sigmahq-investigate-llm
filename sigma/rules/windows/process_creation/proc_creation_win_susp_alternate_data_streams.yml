  ### Technical Context
  The "Execute From Alternate Data Streams" detection rule identifies potential malicious activities that utilize NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) to execute hidden commands. ADS allows files to contain more than one data stream, enabling adversaries to conceal executable payloads within seemingly benign files, such as text files. This tactic falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Defense Evasion technique T1564.004, where attackers manipulate file attributes to avoid detection and maintain persistence. 
  This rule focuses on specific command-line executions that include indicators of ADS usage, such as commands that contain 'txt:' or tools commonly employed to manipulate alternate data streams, including `type`, `makecab`, `reg`, `regedit`, and `esentutl`. The technical data sources involved in this detection primarily stem from Windows process creation logs, which capture command-line parameters and the processes that invoke these commands.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine relevant Windows Event Logs (e.g., Sysmon or Security) to identify any process creation events corresponding to the commands flagged by the detection rule.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command line of any suspect processes to confirm the presence of ADS indicators and associated tools. Note the presence of 'txt:' or other specified command patterns.
  - **Correlate with EDR Insights:** Utilize your EDR solution to check the contextual behavior of these processes, focusing on their parent processes and any unusual file access patterns. Investigate any connected processes for signs of malicious activity.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Check network traffic logs (from NDR or firewall logs) for any outbound connections associated with the responding processes. Consider correlating with proxy logs to assess external communications that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level assigned to this alert indicates that execution from Alternate Data Streams could represent a unique and often overlooked method of attack. While not immediately damaging, it can suggest advanced tactics employed by adversaries and merits a thorough analysis to prevent potential escalation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several limitations to this detection rule. The primary issue is that not all commands or tools used for ADS manipulation may be captured, potentially allowing adversaries to evade detection by obfuscating their command-line usage. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks may trigger false positives, as some administrative utilities might invoke these techniques for benign purposes. It's assumed that the necessary telemetry is consistently being collected and that commands run with elevated privileges may not always be logged. If attackers use direct methods to manipulate ADS without obvious command-line executions, this rule will not trigger, leaving a gap in visibility.

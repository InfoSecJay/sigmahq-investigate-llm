  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "CobaltStrike Load by Rundll32" is designed to detect the use of the `rundll32.exe` utility to execute malicious code, specifically employed by the Cobalt Strike malware. This detection rule looks for instances where `rundll32.exe` is called with specific command-line parameters indicative of DLL loading, namely the presence of `.dll` and the usage of the `StartW` function. The rule primarily utilizes data from Windows process creation logs, focusing on the attributes of command-line execution, image name, and original file name.
  The detection is targeted toward the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218.011 under the 'Defense Evasion' tactic, which describes the abuse of legitimate system tools to execute potentially harmful code stealthily. By monitoring command-line parameters associated with `rundll32.exe`, incident responders can identify campaigns leveraging this technique to obfuscate their malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs**: Review the Windows Security event logs for any instances of `rundll32.exe` execution, paying close attention to command-line parameters that contain `.dll` and `StartW`.
    
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts**: Utilize the EDR tool to track any related processes spawned by `rundll32.exe`. Look for parent-child relationships indicating if trusted processes were used to launch malicious commands.
    
  - **Check Network Activity**: Utilize network detection tools to analyze outbound connections from the device in question. This helps determine if there were connections to known malicious IPs or domains associated with Cobalt Strike.
    
  - **Inspect Sysmon Logs**: Review Sysmon logs for related events, particularly focusing on image loads and network connections to validate the integrity of the processes and identify potential lateral movement within the network.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential impact associated with successful malware execution. Detection of `rundll32.exe` being used in this context often indicates a significant security breach and requires immediate investigation and remediation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger if the attacker uses renaming techniques or variant executables instead of `rundll32.exe`. Additionally, legitimate applications might occasionally use similar command-line structures, creating false positives. Also, if security monitoring is not comprehensive across all endpoints or if Sysmon logging configuration is not enabled, the detection capability will be diminished.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - Mouse Lock Execution" aims to detect the execution of a potentially unwanted application (PUA), specifically the legitimate software known as "Mouse Lock." This tool has been flagged in Kaspersky's 2020 Incident Response Analyst Report for its association with credential access and data collection in various security incidents. The rule looks for specific indicators in the process creation logs, including the presence of the string "Mouse Lock" in the `Product` field, "Misc314" in the `Company` field, and commands containing "Mouse Lock_" in the `CommandLine` parameters. By monitoring these specific attributes, the rule detects potential misuse of this software that could lead to unauthorized data access or activity.
  The detection relies on the Windows event logs related to process creation, which provide insights into software execution on the system. The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactics of Credential Access (T1071) and Collection (T1560), offering a framework for understanding the potential risk involved with this application.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the EDR for Process Details:** Review EDR logs to analyze the process creation events related to "Mouse Lock" and verify the user who executed the process, looking for any anomalous user behavior.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Examine the command line arguments associated with the process to identify any flags or options that may indicate malicious intentions or unusual use of the application.
  - **Cross-Reference Access Logs:** Use Proxy or VPN logs to identify any outbound connections initiated by the "Mouse Lock" process, which may indicate data exfiltration or connection to suspicious IP addresses.
  - **Assess for False Positives:** Verify whether the software is part of legitimate business operations; check company documentation or software repositories to confirm its expected use.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level due to the dual nature of "Mouse Lock" as a legitimate tool and a potential risk; it may indicate unauthorized attempts to access sensitive information or data collection activities that could impact security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire for instances where the software is renamed or modified by an adversary, as the detection relies on specific strings in the product and command line. Additionally, the rule assumes the installation of "Mouse Lock" follows typical patterns; atypical deployment methods may bypass detection. The detection effectiveness can also be limited in environments where legitimate uses of the software are prevalent, which may lead to an increased rate of false positives.

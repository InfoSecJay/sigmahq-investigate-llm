  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious command-line parameters that are often employed by attackers using web shells for reconnaissance activities. It specifically targets process creation events on Windows servers, focusing on commonly exploited web server images such as `w3wp.exe`, `php-cgi.exe`, `nginx.exe`, and others. The rule examines various suspicious characteristics of the parent image and command line arguments to identify signs of web shell usage and other reconnaissance techniques, including information gathering from system commands like `net.exe` and `ping.exe`.
  The detection logic incorporates multiple conditions that require at least one match from the web server selections and one from the suspicious command selections to raise an alert. The MITRE ATT&CK tactics relevant to this rule include **Persistence** (T1505.003) for web shell deployment and **Command-Line Interface** (T1059) activity through various executables, alongside discovery techniques such as **Network Service Scanning** (T1018) and **System Information Discovery** (T1087).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response logs to identify if the alert is related to any known malicious activity or if it corresponds to legitimate administrative tasks.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Use Windows Security and Sysmon logs to confirm the context and legitimacy of the processes that triggered the alert, specifically noting the parent-child process relationships.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command-line parameters and any outputs related to the commands listed in the alert, particularly for any unusual or unauthorized usage patterns.
  - **Validate Network Connections:** Review network activity in the NDR and firewall logs that correspond to the alert timestamps to identify any associated remote connections or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered high due to the potential for significant operational impact, data breaches, or system compromise if a web shell is successfully deployed and used for further malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the web server process is modified or renamed to avoid detection, as well as if command-line arguments are obfuscated or altered in ways that do not match the specified patterns. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks may inadvertently generate similar processes, leading to false positives. Analysts should also be cautious about environmental context and ensure that monitoring configurations are properly set to capture all necessary telemetry.

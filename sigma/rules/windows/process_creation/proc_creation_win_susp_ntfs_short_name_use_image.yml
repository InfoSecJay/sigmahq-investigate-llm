  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Use NTFS Short Name in Image" identifies instances where applications make use of Windows 8.3 short names (e.g., `~1.bat`, `~2.exe`) in their image paths. This technique is often employed by malicious actors to evade detection mechanisms, particularly those that scrutinize conventional file names. The rule utilizes process creation logs captured by Sysmon, focusing on the `Image` field to identify the presence of short names in executable files. Additionally, it filters out benign instances by excluding common parent processes like `C:\Windows\explorer.exe`, `WebExHost.exe`, and others associated with legitimate software installations.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1564.004 (Hide Artifacts). By detecting the use of short names, the rule helps analysts identify potentially malicious activities that could bypass standard security solutions by masking their true identities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize an EDR solution to search for instances of short name usage in process creation logs corresponding to the detection criteria.
  - **Analyze Parent Processes**: Verify the parent process of any flagged instance to determine if it is an expected system process or part of known legitimate software.
  - **Check Application Logs**: Consult application logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs) to identify any related activities or anomalies associated with the detected processes.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Use NDR tools to investigate if any of the flagged processes exhibited suspicious network behavior, such as unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the use of NTFS short names can indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious behavior and evade detection mechanisms, this alert is assigned a medium severity level in an enterprise environment. Prompt investigation is crucial to discern whether the observed behavior is malicious or an artifact of benign software activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire for instances where attackers employ custom short names that do not follow the standard format, or if processes utilize legitimate, signed applications that override detection protocols. Additionally, if the monitoring for process creation is misconfigured or disabled, detections will be ineffective. Analysts should be aware that legitimate software installers could trigger false positives; hence, context around the process's behavior is essential for accurate interpretation.

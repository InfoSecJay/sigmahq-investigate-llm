  Detects changes to environment variables related to ETW logging via the CommandLine.
  This could indicate potential adversaries stopping ETW providers recording loaded .NET assemblies.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential tampering with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logging settings within .NET processes. By monitoring command-line parameters that include 'COMPlus_ETWEnabled' and 'COMPlus_ETWFlags', the rule looks for modifications that may indicate an attacker is trying to prevent ETW providers from capturing relevant data about loaded .NET assemblies. This technique falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically associated with the Defense Evasion tactic (T1562), where adversaries manipulate security mechanisms to avoid detection during their operations. The primary data source for this rule is the Windows Process Creation logs, which capture the command-line arguments used when a process is initiated.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process Source:** Check the originating process of the command-line activity using EDR solutions to determine if it is a known application or a potentially malicious entity.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line arguments of the flagged process for any suspicious modifiers, particularly focusing on settings that alter logging behavior.
  - **Cross-Reference with Event Logs:** Review Windows Security and System event logs for any corresponding security events that might provide context or correlate with the time of the process creation.
  - **Assess Related Network Activity:** Utilize NDR tools to evaluate any network connections initiated by the suspicious process, which could indicate further malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the critical nature of ETW logging in monitoring the behavior of applications. Tampering with these logging mechanisms can signify advanced adversarial techniques and poses a significant risk if attackers are hiding their activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that command-line parameters are being logged adequately in the environment. However, if a process is executed in a manner that does not record these command-line arguments or if there are specific security policies that restrict event logging, the rule may not fire. Additionally, skilled adversaries may employ obfuscation techniques or leverage trusted processes to evade detection.

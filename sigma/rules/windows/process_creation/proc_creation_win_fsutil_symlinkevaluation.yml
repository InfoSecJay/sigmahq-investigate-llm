id: c0b2768a-dd06-4671-8339-b16ca8d1f27f
status: test
description: |
  A symbolic link is a type of file that contains a reference to another file.
  This is probably done to make sure that the ransomware is able to follow shortcuts on the machine in order to find the original file to encrypt

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Fsutil Behavior Set SymlinkEvaluation" is designed to detect potentially malicious behaviors associated with the use of the **fsutil.exe** command-line tool in Windows environments. Specifically, this rule focuses on the execution of commands that modify the symbolic link evaluation behavior in Windows. Symbolic links are shortcuts that allow programs to reference files, and their manipulation may be indicative of tactics employed by ransomware to locate and encrypt target files efficiently. The detection leverages **process creation logs** to capture instances where the command string includes keywords such as 'behavior', 'set', and 'SymlinkEvaluation', indicating a change in system configuration that could facilitate unauthorized file access. This activity is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1059** (Command Line Interface), which outlines the use of command line interfaces for execution of commands to achieve various malicious goals.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Execution Context:** Investigate the execution details of **fsutil.exe** within your EDR by checking the process creation logs to ascertain the user and system accounts involved in the execution. Look for unusual timing or context surrounding the command execution.
  - **Correlate with Security Logs:** Check Windows Security logs for any alerts or anomalies around the same time as the detection. Focus on logs indicating changes to system integrity, file creations, or modifications.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize your NDR/NGFW to analyze any network connections made by processes initiated around the same time, looking for unusual patterns or links with known malicious IP addresses.
  - **Examine Recent Changes:** Investigate any recent file or registry modifications made on the system following the command execution. Ensure to analyze if such changes correlate with known adversarial behaviors or if they appear legitimate.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to its potential implications for compromising file integrity and system functionality, particularly in environments where ransomware is a known threat.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot is that legitimate applications may also invoke `fsutil.exe` for necessary administrative tasks, possibly resulting in false positives. Additionally, if the necessary logging or monitoring of `process_creation` events is not correctly configured or implemented in your environment, the rule may fail to fire. Adversaries may also deploy evasion techniques, such as utilizing alternative tools or process injection techniques that do not invoke `fsutil.exe` directly, rendering this detection ineffective.

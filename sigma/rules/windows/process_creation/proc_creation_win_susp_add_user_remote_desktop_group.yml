  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where users are added to the local Remote Desktop Users group, which may indicate potential lateral movement or persistent access being established by malicious actors. The rule looks for process creation events triggered by commands involving "Net localgroup" or "Add-LocalGroupMember" specifically indicating manipulation of group memberships related to remote desktop access. By monitoring command-line parameters and user activity associated with these commands, the rule helps to flag unauthorized administrative actions. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques tagged here include T1136.001 (Cloud Credentials from Local Assets) and T1021.001 (Remote Services: RDP), making it a critical indicator to watch for during security investigations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Recent Additions**: Check the Windows Security Event Logs for Event ID 4728 to identify who was added to the Remote Desktop Users group and when, focusing on any unauthorized changes.
  - **Validate User Accounts**: Use Active Directory or local user management tools to confirm whether the accounts added to the group are legitimate and appropriate for Remote Desktop access.
  - **Analyze Command Line Context**: Utilize EDR tools to collect and review specific command-line execution logs that led to the addition of users, assessing for anomalies or signs of malicious intent.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity**: Check the logs for network connections made by the newly added users, focusing on unusual access attempts or privileged actions that could suggest misuse of access.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because the addition of users to the Remote Desktop Users group can lead to unauthorized remote access, thereby increasing the risk of data breaches and insider threats in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary uses alternative methods to add users, such as scripting or invoking the commands in a way that does not trigger process creation logs. Additionally, if administrative activities are conducted by legitimate users with proper authorization, these may not be flagged, creating potential blind spots. It is also assumed that the detection environment is configured to adequately capture the relevant telemetry data; hence any issues with logging could lead to failures in detection.

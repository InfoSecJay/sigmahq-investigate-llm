title: WebDav Client Execution Via Rundll32.EXE
id: 2dbd9d3d-9e27-42a8-b8df-f13825c6c3d5
status: test
description: |
  Detects "svchost.exe" spawning "rundll32.exe" with command arguments like "C:\windows\system32\davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie".
  This could be an indicator of exfiltration or use of WebDav to launch code (hosted on a WebDav server).

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity involving the `svchost.exe` process utilizing `rundll32.exe` to execute a WebDav client function. Specifically, the rule looks for instances where `svchost.exe` is spawning `rundll32.exe` with specific command-line arguments, such as `C:\windows\system32\davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie`. This command suggests the possibility of data exfiltration or the execution of code hosted on a WebDav server, which is classified under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Exfiltration and the technique T1048.003, "Software Packing".
  Relevant data sources for this detection include process creation logs that capture information about process execution and parent-child relationships. By monitoring these logs, the rule can identify abnormal process interactions that may indicate infiltration attempts or unauthorized data access, enabling timely incident response by security analysts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs**: Review the process creation logs in your SIEM, focusing on `svchost.exe` and `rundll32.exe`. Confirm the legitimacy of these processes in the context of your environment.
    
  - **Inspect Command-Line Parameters**: Extract command-line arguments for occurrences of `rundll32.exe`. Ensure that no unauthorized code or scripts are being executed from suspicious directories.
  - **Evaluate Network Activity**: Look into network logs for any outgoing connections that coincide with the identified process execution. Pay special attention to external connections established by the involved processes, which may relate to exfiltration.
  - **Review Incident History**: Cross-reference the findings with historical incidents and behavioral baselines set for your environment. Identify any patterns that align with known threats or confirmed indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential implications of data exfiltration via WebDav, alerts from this rule should be treated as medium severity and warrant immediate investigation to mitigate risk to sensitive enterprise data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule presumes that all relevant telemetry sources are operational and properly configured to capture necessary process creation events. Potential blind spots include scenarios where `rundll32.exe` is executed from a different parent process or if the command-line parameters are obfuscated. Additionally, defensive measures such as endpoint protection solutions may inhibit visibility into malicious behavior, and threat actors may employ methods to bypass detection.

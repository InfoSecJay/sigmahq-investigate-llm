  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially suspicious child processes spawned by ClickOnce deployment applications. ClickOnce is a Microsoft technology that allows users to install and run Windows-based applications by clicking a link in a web page. Due to its inherent trust and execution context, malicious actors can exploit this framework to execute harmful code. The rule specifically looks for processes created under the `\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\` directory—where ClickOnce applications typically reside—and checks if these processes match a list of known suspicious executables, such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others that are often misused in attacks.
  The monitoring focuses primarily on Windows process creation logs, which capture critical information about process execution and parent-child relationships. When this rule is triggered, it suggests that a benign ClickOnce application may have been leveraged for malicious purposes, warranting further investigation. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics for this rule include `Execution` and `Defense Evasion`, as attackers may use this technique to carry out unauthorized actions while evading detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine the Process Tree:** Use EDR tools to visualize the parent-child relationship between processes. Confirm whether the suspicious child process was indeed initiated by a legitimate ClickOnce application.
    
  - **Review Execution Context:** Check the command-line parameters and execution context of the suspicious process using Sysmon logs. Look for unusual arguments or flags that might indicate malicious intent.
    
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Investigate any network connections made by the suspicious child process using NDR logs. Observe if data is being exfiltrated or if connections are made to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
    
  - **Check File and Registry Activity:** Utilize Windows Security event logs to review file system changes and registry modifications associated with the suspicious process. Determine if any critical system files or registry keys were impacted.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for malicious actions originating from trusted ClickOnce applications, which can lead to significant security risks within the enterprise. Timely investigation is essential to mitigate possible threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where an attacker uses non-suspicious processes not listed in the detection rule or employs obfuscation techniques to bypass the checks. It also assumes that the ClickOnce application is executing in a standard environment without modifications to its usual runtime behavior. Analysts should be aware that sophisticated adversaries may modify binary signatures or use custom applications that do not match known suspicious patterns, resulting in missed detections.

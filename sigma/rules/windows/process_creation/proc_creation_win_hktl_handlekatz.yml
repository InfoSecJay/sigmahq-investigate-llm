  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "HackTool 
  - HandleKatz LSASS Dumper Execution" is designed to detect the execution of the HandleKatz tool, which is used for extracting sensitive information from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process by creating an obfuscated memory dump. This capability leverages cloned handles, allowing an adversary to extract credentials and other sensitive data from memory without alerting security measures. The rule focuses on parsing process creation logs from Windows, specifically looking for command-line arguments associated with the HandleKatz tool, such as `--pid:` to target the LSASS process and keywords indicating memory dump output, including `.dmp`, `.obf`, and the presence of the LSASS service name. The rule highlights the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access (Technique T1003.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize your EDR solution to locate process creation events that correspond with the identified command line arguments and image names associated with HandleKatz.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters for the process in question, specifically looking for indicators like `--pid:`, `--outfile:`, and file extensions such as `.dmp` or `.obf`.
  - **Check for Suspicious Parent Processes:** Correlate the detected HandleKatz execution with its parent process; anomalous parent-child relationships may indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Utilize your NDR tools to analyze any unusual outbound connections that coincide with the timing of the HandleKatz execution, as attackers may attempt to exfiltrate obtained data.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the nature of the potential credential theft and the sensitive information at risk when LSASS is targeted by such tools, which could lead to unauthorized access to accounts and aggravate the impact of a security breach.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the execution of HandleKatz occurs without the specific command-line arguments monitored by the rule or if the tool is renamed. Additionally, if the adversary uses advanced evasion tactics, such as DLL injection or process hollowing to obscure its activities, those actions may bypass detection. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this rule is contingent upon Sysmon being correctly configured and operational across systems in the environment.

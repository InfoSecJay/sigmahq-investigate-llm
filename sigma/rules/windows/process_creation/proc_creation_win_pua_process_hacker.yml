  Detects the execution of Process Hacker based on binary metadata information (Image, Hash, Imphash, etc).
  Process Hacker is a tool to view and manipulate processes, kernel options and other low level options.
  Threat actors abused older vulnerable versions to manipulate system processes.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - Process Hacker Execution" identifies the execution of the Process Hacker tool, which is known for its ability to manipulate processes and system settings at a low level. Process Hacker, while useful for legitimate administrative purposes, has been exploited by threat actors in older, vulnerable versions to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to systems. The rule leverages various indicators such as file names, hashes, and binary attributes of the Process Hacker executable, targeting data sources like process creation logs. Specifically, it examines the `Image`, `OriginalFileName`, `Description`, and other metadata associated with executed processes, focusing on strings and hash values associated with known malicious or suspicious versions of Process Hacker. This rule is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of defense evasion, discovery, persistence, and privilege escalation, with specific techniques tagged including T1622, T1564, and T1543.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs in your EDR solution to identify the execution details of Process Hacker, including the parent process, user context, and execution time.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Review any network connections made by the Process Hacker executable via the NDR or firewall logs to assess if it attempted any suspicious communications.
  - **Verify User Permissions:** Determine the user account that executed Process Hacker by looking at the Windows Security logs. Check if the account has the necessary permissions and whether it aligns with typical administrative activities.
  - **Assess the System for Anomalous Behavior:** Utilize the AV logs to detect any alerts triggered during or after the execution of Process Hacker, as well as evaluate any changes made to critical system files or configurations.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this rule is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential risk associated with the use of Process Hacker, which may indicate either legitimate administrative tasks or malicious behavior. Prompt investigation is needed to ascertain the context and justification for its use within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger if Process Hacker is executed with renamed files or if newer, unfiltered versions are used that do not match the hashes or names defined in the rule. Additionally, the detection relies on the presence of standard logging configurations; if process creation logging is disabled or misconfigured, it may lead to missed detections. Furthermore, legitimate use by administration can lead to false positives, requiring a clear policy on the usage of such tools within the enterprise.

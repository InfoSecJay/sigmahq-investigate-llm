  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activities associated with the usage of the `certutil.exe` utility in a Windows environment. `certutil.exe` is a built-in command-line tool for managing certificates and executing tasks related to certificate services. Cybercriminals often misuse this utility to download files from file-sharing websites as a method of evading security measures. This rule triggers when `certutil.exe` is executed with command-line arguments indicative of file downloading from suspicious domains, such as GitHub, Dropbox, or other known file-sharing platforms. The detection leverages process creation logs, specifically focusing on the image name, original file name, and command-line parameters to ascertain malicious intent. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1027), as it showcases how legitimate tools can be employed by adversaries to bypass security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR tools to investigate the process creation logs for instances where `certutil.exe` was invoked, particularly focusing on the presence of flagged command-line parameters.
  - **Correlate IP/Domain Access**: Use the proxy and DNS logs to identify any network connections to the domains listed in the command line arguments during the time of the suspicious `certutil.exe` execution.
  - **Examine Downloaded Payload**: If a file was downloaded, retrieve it from the suspect endpoint and analyze the contents to determine if it contains malicious code or artifacts.
  - **Check for Other Indicator of Compromise (IoCs)**: Look for any additional anomalies or IoCs associated with the executing system, including related processes that may indicate further lateral movement or compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential of the detected activity to facilitate the download of malicious payloads, thereby increasing the risk of further compromise and deeper intrusion within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule relies on the proper logging of process creation events and may not trigger if process logging is disabled or improperly configured. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes obfuscation techniques to bypass detection (e.g., altering the command-line syntax), the rule may not fire. Another assumption is that the flagged URLs are consistently used by malicious actors; new or less common usage may not be detected immediately.

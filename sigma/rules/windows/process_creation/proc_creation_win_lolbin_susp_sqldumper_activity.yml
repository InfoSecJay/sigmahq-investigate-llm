  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious process dumping activity using the legitimate Windows binary `sqldumper.exe`. The rule focuses on process creation events where the command line parameters include specific hex values indicative of a process dump. The primary data sources involved are process creation logs that capture information about software executed on Windows systems, particularly monitoring for instances of `sqldumper.exe`. By inspecting the command line arguments associated with this binary, the rule helps identify attempts to extract sensitive data from memory that may otherwise go unnoticed, especially in environments where SQL Server is in use. The rule aims to mitigate the risk of credential theft and other credential access techniques enumerated in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the EDR logs to identify the instance of `sqldumper.exe` that triggered the alert, focusing on process lineage to understand its origin and parent process.
  - Check the command line arguments associated with the alerting instance to verify if they match the suspicious patterns of interest related to memory dumping.
  - Investigate any related network activity using the proxy or NDR logs to determine if there were any data exfiltration attempts or suspicious external communications following the process dump.
  - Cross-reference the alert with the recent activity in AWS, GCP, or Azure logs to uncover any anomalous access patterns or changes made to systems that might indicate a broader attack.

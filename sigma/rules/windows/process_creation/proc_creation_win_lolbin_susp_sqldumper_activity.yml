  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Dumping Process via Sqldumper.exe" is designed to identify suspicious activities involving the legitimate Windows executable `sqldumper.exe`. This binary is typically used for debugging and can be exploited by attackers to dump process memory, which can capture sensitive information such as credentials. The rule monitors specific attributes of process creation, particularly focusing on the command-line parameters associated with `sqldumper.exe`. It looks for command lines containing certain hexadecimal values (`0x0110` and `0x01100:40`) that may be indicative of unauthorized memory dumping attempts. The telemetry monitoring for this rule relies on Windows Sysmon and specifically the process creation events. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Credential Access and technique T1003.001, highlighting its potential use in credential theft.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the Process Creation Logs:** Review the Sysmon process creation logs for instances of `sqldumper.exe` being executed. Pay special attention to the command-line arguments to understand the context of its execution.
  - **Analyze Related Processes:** Identify any parent processes that initiated `sqldumper.exe`. This can provide insights into whether it was run via legitimate means or if it might be associated with malicious activity.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Use EDR solutions to correlate other logs related to the timeline of the detected activity, such as network connections or file modifications, that occurred simultaneously with the execution of `sqldumper.exe`.
  - **Review User Context:** Determine which user account triggered the execution of `sqldumper.exe`. Assessing user privileges may help in evaluating whether the execution was within normal operational parameters or indicative of a compromised account.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been assigned a medium severity level as the use of `sqldumper.exe` can be a legitimate administrative action; however, if seen in unexpected contexts or without corresponding administrative tasks, it warrants further investigation due to the risk of credential harvesting techniques.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if `sqldumper.exe` is called with alternate parameters or if the process is executed in a way that avoids detection by Sysmon. Additionally, if legitimate applications or processes are using `sqldumper.exe` in a typical user context, it could lead to false positives. Adversaries may use code obfuscation or rename the executable to evade detection, requiring continuous updates and adjustments to the rule for effectiveness.

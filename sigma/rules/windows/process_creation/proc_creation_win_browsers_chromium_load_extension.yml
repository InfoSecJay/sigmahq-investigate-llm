  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where Chromium-based web browsers, specifically Brave, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi, are executed with the command-line flag `--load-extension=`. This flag is used to load custom extensions when launching the browser, which can be leveraged by adversaries to load malicious or unauthorized extensions. By monitoring process creation logs, particularly focusing on the command-line parameters, the rule can detect suspicious activities that may indicate an attempt at persistence or other malicious actions as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Persistence (T1176). The key technical data sources utilized include process creation logs, where the specific command-line arguments are parsed for signs of these behaviors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Context:** Examine the context of the process from the EDR tool to verify the user account, the time of execution, and any associated parent processes that may provide insights into the legitimacy of the command.
  - **Review Installed Browser Extensions:** Using the browser's interface or directories, review the loaded extensions against a known good list to identify unauthorized or suspicious extensions that may have been loaded.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to inspect any outgoing network connections initiated by the browser for signs of data exfiltration or malware communication.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Search through Windows event logs and cloud logs for any other anomalous activities occurring around the same time, such as unusual authentication attempts or changes to browser settings.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for an adversary to maintain persistence via malicious extensions. Immediate investigation is warranted as this could indicate an ongoing compromise impacting the security of the browser and potentially the entire system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the execution of a browser with the `--load-extension` flag is never legitimate in the environment, which may not always be true. It may fail to fire in scenarios where the browser is run without user-initiated command-line flags or when the use of testing tools like BurpSuite is legitimate. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries may employ obfuscation techniques to launch processes without specified flags, bypassing detection.

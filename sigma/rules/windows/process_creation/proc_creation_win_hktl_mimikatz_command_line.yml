  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets the execution of Mimikatz, a well-known credential dumping tool utilized by attackers to extract credentials from the Windows operating system. It focuses on specific command-line arguments commonly associated with Mimikatz operations, such as "DumpCreds," and various inherent function calls and module names related to credential harvesting. The rule leverages process creation logs as its primary data source to identify instances where Mimikatz is invoked, potentially indicating a credential theft attack. The authoritative sources for this rule highlight its relevance to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Credential Access (TA0006), and specifically techniques such as credential dumping (T1003.001), and various module-specific techniques like lsadump (T1003.004) and sekurlsa (T1003.006), which can reveal critical user secrets.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Source:** Check the process creation logs in the EDR system to identify the origin of the Mimikatz execution, noting both the user and machine context.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Review the command line arguments associated with the detected process to understand which specific Mimikatz modules were utilized.
  - **Check User Accounts:** Investigate the accounts involved in the Mimikatz execution, especially for signs of unauthorized access or anomalous user behavior preceding the event.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Utilize the NDR system to evaluate any outgoing connections made by the suspicious process to detect potential data exfiltration efforts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity level due to the critical nature of credential theft, which could lead to significant breaches in security and allow attackers to escalate their privileges and maintain persistence in the targeted environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where Mimikatz is executed with obfuscated or altered command-line arguments, or if executed in a way that circumvents process creation logging (e.g., in-memory execution). Additionally, legitimate tools used for administrative purposes might unintentionally mimic the command patterns of Mimikatz, resulting in false negatives. Engineers should be aware that adversaries often adapt their techniques to evade detection, which indicates the need for continuous rule tuning and enhancement.

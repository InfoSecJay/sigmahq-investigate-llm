  ### Technical Context
  The "Whoami.EXE Execution Anomaly" detection rule is established to identify potentially suspicious executions of the Windows command-line utility `whoami.exe` when triggered by unexpected parent processes. This rule monitors process creation events specifically looking for instances of `whoami.exe`, a tool typically used to obtain user identity and permissions in the Windows environment. The rule is designed to flag such occurrences when the parent process does not belong to a standard or expected application, such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `powershell_ise.exe`, or an authorized monitoring agent. This is significant because attackers sometimes use `whoami.exe` in their reconnaissance activities to gather information about user privileges, and unusual parent processes may indicate automated scripts or malicious behavior.
  The relevant technical data sources for this detection include Windows Process Creation logs from Sysmon, which log details about the processes being created, including their names, parent processes, and command-line parameters. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic of "Discovery" and specifically targets the technique T1033 ("System Owner/User Discovery"), which is often exploited during reconnaissance phases of an attack.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the Sysmon process creation logs for instances of `whoami.exe` and analyze the parent processes involved to validate whether they are standard or represent potential malicious activity.
  - **Examine Associated Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line parameters passed to `whoami.exe`, as they may provide additional context or reveal suspicious usage patterns that warrant further investigation.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Review related logs such as Windows Security logs, EDR alerts, and network logs to look for any preceding or subsequent unusual activity associated with the same user or endpoint.
  - **Investigate User Behavior:** Assess the behavior of the user account executing `whoami.exe` to determine if it is a known administrator or if there are any anomalies in their recent actions that may suggest compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized access and reconnaissance in the environment. It necessitates investigation, especially if seen in conjunction with other indicators of compromise or in unusual contexts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot for this rule is the legitimate administrative use of `whoami.exe`, which may generate false positives during regular operations or maintenance activities. Additionally, if attackers use legitimate tools or scripts that run from expected parent processes, the rule may not trigger. It is assumed that administrative activity within the environment is properly monitored; however, if authorized scripts or custom applications invoke `whoami.exe`, these instances could go undetected.

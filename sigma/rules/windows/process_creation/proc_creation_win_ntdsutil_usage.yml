  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the invocation of the Active Directory Diagnostic Tool, `ntdsutil.exe`, which is often leveraged in attacks targeting the NTDS database (NTDS.DIT) on Windows servers. The detection focuses on process creation events by monitoring logs that indicate when `ntdsutil.exe` is executed, specifically filtering for instances where the image path ends in `ntdsutil.exe`. The relevant data sources for this rule include Windows Event Logs associated with process creation, which capture detailed information regarding the command-line execution context and the user under which the process was initiated. The identified MITRE ATT&CK tactic is Credential Access, specifically technique T1003.003, which highlights the potential for this tool to be misused in unauthorized access scenarios.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Security Event logs for process creation events involving `ntdsutil.exe` to confirm unauthorized access attempts or circumstantial usage.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line parameters used during the execution of `ntdsutil.exe` to establish the intent behind its invocation and to identify any suspicious options that may indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate the user account associated with the execution of `ntdsutil.exe` to determine whether it aligns with normal administrative operations or indicates potential misuse by an unauthorized user.
  - **Review Related Logs:** Query other related data sources such as Sysmon logs, which may reveal additional context, including prior network connections or processes that may have interacted with `ntdsutil.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is scored as medium severity as the use of `ntdsutil.exe` outside of regular administrative maintenance could indicate an attempt to compromise Active Directory data or manipulate domain services, warranting further investigation to prevent credential theft or unauthorized privilege escalation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where `ntdsutil.exe` is executed under specific conditions that do not trigger standard process creation logging, such as being run in a highly privileged account in a secure environment where logs are not adequately collected. Additionally, it may not detect legitimate administrative activities if proper audit policies are in place, leading to potential false negatives. Assumptions include that attackers may use alternate means to access the NTDS database or could disable logging entirely to evade detection.

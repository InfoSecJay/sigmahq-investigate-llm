  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "PUA 
  - NSudo Execution" is designed to detect the use of NSudo, a tool that allows processes to be executed with elevated privileges and within different user contexts, including System and Trusted Installer. This rule specifically monitors process creation events in the Windows operating system, looking for process images related to NSudo such as `NSudo.exe`, `NSudoLC.exe`, and `NSudoLG.exe`. The rule also inspects the command-line parameters to identify instances where NSudo is invoked with potentially malicious flags, such as those that request high integrity or all privileges. By utilizing the `process_creation` log source from Windows, the rule aims to catch unauthorized or suspicious usage of this powerful tool, which is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Execution" and the technique "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1569.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine process creation events in your EDR solution filtering for NSudo.exe or its variants to confirm the context of their execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Look at command-line parameters used in conjunction with NSudo to determine whether there are any flags indicating potential misuse, particularly those that escalate privileges.
  - **Check for Legitimate Use Cases:** Validate whether the identified instances of NSudo execution are associated with known administrative tasks or automation processes by cross-referencing against a change log or authorized configurations.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Events:** Use additional telemetry from AV logs or SIEM alerts to check for any related suspicious activity that coincides with the time of NSudo usage, which could indicate an attack or compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity as the execution of NSudo may indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or execute malicious code with elevated permissions, posing a significant risk to system integrity and overall security in the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if NSudo is executed with obfuscated command-line parameters or if the process is invoked through legitimate administrative scripts that are authorized in the environment. Additionally, if the executable is renamed or if configurations prevent the logging of process creation events, detections will fail. Assumptions include the availability of process creation logs, consistency in nomenclature, and that the analysis will depend heavily on the configuration and usage policies established by the organization.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential malicious activity associated with the use of a whitelisted process, specifically `TrolleyExpress.exe`, to access and dump the memory of the `lsass.exe` process. The `lsass.exe` process is crucial for managing user authentication and can contain sensitive credential information, making it a prime target for attackers seeking to extract such data. The rule focuses on specific command line arguments associated with `TrolleyExpress.exe`, including references to specific process IDs within a predetermined range (700-999) that are typically used by the `lsass.exe` process. Furthermore, it looks for potential variations in how `TrolleyExpress.exe` is invoked, ensuring that any execution under this name that is not tied to known and authorized usage, is flagged for further examination.
  The technical data sources involved in this rule include process creation logs, specifically the command line parameters associated with the execution of processes. By monitoring these logs, analysts can identify potentially unauthorized or malicious use of the `TrolleyExpress.exe` file to access the memory of `lsass.exe`. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Defense Evasion (T1218.011) and Credential Access (T1003.001), indicating that the activity may involve an actor attempting to evade detection and access sensitive credential information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events**: Use EDR capabilities to filter and examine process creation logs for instances of `TrolleyExpress.exe` and check the command-line parameters for unauthorized usages targeting the `lsass.exe` process.
  - **Analyze Parent Process**: Investigate the parent command line of the detected `TrolleyExpress.exe` processes to understand the context of their execution and verify if it originates from a legitimate source.
  - **Cross-Reference with Known Good**: Consult the list of known valid instances and usages of `TrolleyExpress.exe` to identify discrepancies in usage patterns that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Monitor for Suspicious Network Activity**: Use the NDR and proxy logs to identify any unusual network communications following the identified instances of `TrolleyExpress.exe`, as these could indicate a data exfiltration attempt.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to the serious implications of unauthorized access and potential credential theft from the `lsass.exe` process. Prompt investigation is crucial to prevent data loss or further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several potential blind spots with this rule, including scenarios where `TrolleyExpress.exe` is used legitimately by authorized applications or users, which can lead to false positives. Additionally, if attackers utilize an alternate or unknown process to dump `lsass.exe` without leveraging `TrolleyExpress.exe`, this rule will not detect those instances. Analysts should assume that the list of process IDs may evolve over time, and remain vigilant for tactics that adversaries may employ to disguise malicious activities.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious scheduled tasks that execute encoded payloads from the Windows Registry using PowerShell. Specifically, it identifies when the tool `schtasks.exe` is invoked to create a task that includes a command to run PowerShell with a base64-encoded command retrieved from registry keys. The rule leverages process creation logs, particularly focusing on command-line parameters that indicate encoding actions and registry accesses. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques include `T1053.005` (Scheduled Task/Job for Windows), which pertains to the use of scheduled tasks for persistence, and `T1059.001` (PowerShell), which addresses the execution of commands through PowerShell. This combination highlights an important vector for attackers aiming to maintain access and execute payloads stealthily.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Review the EDR for events related to `schtasks.exe` execution, filtering for instances where the command line contains `/Create`, indicating a new scheduled task creation.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments**: Identify if the PowerShell command includes `FromBase64String` or similar commands suggesting payload encoding or registry access. Pay attention to arguments that reference the current user or local machine registry (e.g., `HKCU:\` or `HKLM:\`).
  - **Review Registry Activity**: Utilize Windows Security logs to analyze recent registry access events that pertain to the involved registry keys. Look for suspicious modifications or queries to `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\`.
  - **Check Scheduled Tasks**: Audit the scheduler for newly created tasks that correspond with the detection. Verify the legitimacy of the tasks and document any anomalies in task scripts or associated command lines.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this rule, alerts should be prioritized for immediate investigation. The creation of scheduled tasks that execute encoded payloads represents a significant risk, indicating potential malicious persistence mechanisms that could compromise system integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if an attacker employs obfuscation tactics to disguise the PowerShell command, such as encoding the entire command string or using different execution methods. Furthermore, it assumes that the logging level is set to capture detailed command-line arguments and that the detection mechanisms (EDR/SIEM) are configured correctly to report these events. Additionally, if the `schtasks.exe` utility is not used, but an alternative method is employed to schedule tasks (e.g., using Group Policy), the rule will fail to detect such activities.

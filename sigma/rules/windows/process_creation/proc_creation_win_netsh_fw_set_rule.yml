  ### Technical Context
  The "Firewall Rule Update Via Netsh.EXE" Sigma rule is designed to detect instances where the Windows command-line utility `netsh.exe` is used to modify firewall rules. The rule specifically looks for command-line executions that involve the keyword "firewall" coupled with the "set" option, indicating an attempt to alter existing firewall rules. This behavior is associated with the tactic of Defense Evasion, as classified under the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The pertinent data sources for this rule include process creation logs, which capture details such as the command-line parameters used when the `netsh.exe` process is initiated, and the image load information that uniquely identifies the executable.
  By monitoring the execution of `netsh.exe` with parameters indicative of firewall rule modification, security analysts can flag potentially unauthorized changes to the network's security posture, which may be indicative of malicious activity, particularly in the context of evading security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Initial Review of the Alert:** Check the alert details in the SIEM for associated user accounts and timestamps to determine the context of the `netsh.exe` execution.
  - **Process Exploration:** Use your EDR tool to investigate the process tree related to the alert, verifying whether it was spawned from a legitimate administrative tool or process.
  - **Audit Firewall Configuration:** Examine recent changes to the firewall rules in Windows Firewall settings or through relevant logs (Windows Security logs) to see what specific alterations were made and if they align with expected administrative actions.
  - **User Activity Review:** Investigate the user account associated with the alert in your User Behavior Analytics tool, looking for any unusual patterns or previous alerts that could indicate compromised credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been assigned a medium severity level because unauthorized modifications to firewall rules can significantly undermine security defenses and lead to broader network attacks if not controlled.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `netsh.exe` is executed from an unconventional location or if command-line options are obfuscated. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities that require firewall adjustments can lead to false positives, potentially complicating investigations. Also, if an adversary uses a different method to alter firewall settings or employs encrypted command lines, this detection may fail to trigger.

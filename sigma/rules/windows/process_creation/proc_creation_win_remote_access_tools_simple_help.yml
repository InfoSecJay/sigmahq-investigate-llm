title: Remote Access Tool - Simple Help Execution

status: test
description: |
  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Remote Access Tool 
  - Simple Help Execution" is designed to identify the execution of specific remote access tools (RATs), particularly focusing on files that may denote malicious installations or uses of well-known remote support applications like TeamViewer, Go2Assist, and LogMeIn. The rule examines process creation logs, specifically looking for instances where the image path contains indicators associated with remote access support directories, such as `\JWrapper-Remote Access\` or `\JWrapper-Remote Support\`, and ends with `SimpleService.exe`. These indicators are crucial as they facilitate the establishment of an interactive command-and-control channel, which adversaries may exploit to maintain unauthorized access to systems within a network. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219, which covers the use of remote access tools for command and control.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize the EDR tool to search for recent process creation events associated with `SimpleService.exe` and any relevant paths to determine whether the execution was authorized.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Inspect network logs to identify any outbound connections initiated by the identified process, ensuring no malicious external communication is occurring.
  - **Check for False Positives**: Confirm legitimate use cases of the tool by checking user logs or support cases while cross-referencing with the organizational policy regarding remote access tools.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs**: Review additional telemetry sources, such as Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs, to identify any potentially suspicious behavior associated with the detected process.
  ### Prioritization
  When this alert is triggered, it should be treated with medium severity as it may indicate the use of legitimate software that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The alert necessitates investigation since it could represent either a benign usage scenario or a potential compromise of systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary uses custom or less-known remote access tools that do not match the specified paths or file names. Additionally, if legitimate users frequently utilize these tools for support tasks, it may lead to false positives. There is an assumption that security controls effectively monitor the execution of unauthorized software, which might not always be the case in environments with lax application control.

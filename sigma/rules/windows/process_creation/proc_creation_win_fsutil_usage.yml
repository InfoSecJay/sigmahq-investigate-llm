title: Fsutil Suspicious Invocation
id: add64136-62e5-48ea-807e-88638d02df1e
status: stable
description: |
  Detects suspicious parameters of fsutil (deleting USN journal, configuring it with small size, etc).
  Might be used by ransomwares during the attack (seen by NotPetya and others).

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify suspicious invocations of the `fsutil.exe` command in Windows environments, particularly those associated with malicious activities like ransomware attacks. The rule specifically targets the execution of commands that interact with the USN journal, such as deleting or creating the journal with abnormally small sizes. By monitoring process creation logs, the detection focuses on command-line parameters that include keywords like `deletejournal`, `createjournal`, and `setZeroData`. Such commands could indicate an attempt to hide or manipulate file system changes during an attack, as seen with ransomware variants like NotPetya and Lockbit. This rule captures the presence of potentially harmful configurations and enables SOC teams to respond to critical threats effectively.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR for instances of `fsutil.exe` executing commands that contain `deletejournal`, `createjournal`, or `setZeroData`.
  - Investigate the command line parameters associated with the suspicious `fsutil.exe` invocations to determine if they align with known malicious behaviors.
  - Correlate the timestamps of the alert with other security events in the SIEM to identify any preceding suspicious activities or related incidents.
  - Check for any unusual user accounts or scripts executing the `fsutil` commands in Proxy or cloud environment logs to understand the context of the invocation.

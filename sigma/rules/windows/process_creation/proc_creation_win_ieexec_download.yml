  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "File Download And Execution Via IEExec.EXE" identifies suspicious activities related to the use of the `IEExec.exe` utility, which is part of the Internet Explorer application on Windows systems. When an adversary leverages this component, they can potentially download executable files from remote locations and execute them on the system, thereby establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel. The rule specifically monitors process creation events for signs of `IEExec.exe` being used, focusing on the command-line parameters that include file URLs (both HTTP and HTTPS). The primary technical data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs, specifically monitoring the image names and command-line arguments associated with the process execution.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics, particularly under "Command and Control" and the technique T1105, which highlights the risk of adversaries utilizing tools to retrieve files remotely for execution. Given its capability for remote file execution, alerts triggered by this rule should be treated with significant concern.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check EDR logs to confirm the creation of the `IEExec.exe` process. Investigate the user context and whether unusual command-line parameters were used during its execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line details captured in the event logs. Assess the URLs accessed to identify any potentially malicious files or domain names.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Review logs from the NGFW and NDR to track network connections initiated by the `IEExec.exe` process. Look for any outbound connections to suspicious or known malicious IP addresses.
  - **Review Related System Events:** Utilize Windows Event Logs for additional context on system activities around the time the alert was triggered. Look for related process creations, file modifications, or registry changes.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential severity of a successful file download and execution by adversaries, which can lead to a more extensive compromise of the machine and network. Immediate investigation and response are necessary to mitigate any further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where `IEExec.exe` is not utilized in the environment or if appropriate monitoring of process creation logs is not in place. Additionally, the use of alternative execution methods to download and run malicious files could bypass detection, such as PowerShell scripts or other legitimate utilities. Furthermore, some organizations may have whitelisted certain benign URLs that could mask malicious activities if not properly assessed.

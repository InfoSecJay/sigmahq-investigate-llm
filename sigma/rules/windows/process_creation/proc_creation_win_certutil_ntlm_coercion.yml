  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential NTLM coercion attempts by monitoring for the use of `certutil.exe` with the `-syncwithWU` command-line flag. NTLM coercion is an evasion technique where an attacker can force a system to authenticate to a malicious server, which may expose NTLM credentials. The `certutil.exe` utility, typically used for managing certificates in Windows, can be abused by adversaries to facilitate this technique. The rule specifically looks for process creation logs related to `certutil.exe` while observing if the command line includes the specific pattern that suggests coercion. The Key MITRE ATT&CK techniques addressed by this rule are associated with **Defense Evasion** (T1218), focusing on the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
  The logs being analyzed for this detection rule include Windows process creation logs, which record details such as the image name (`certutil.exe`), original file name, and command-line parameters used during the execution of the process. By examining these logs, SOC analysts can effectively detect suspicious attempts to leverage `certutil.exe` for potential credential theft.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Process Logs:** Review the process creation logs within your EDR to confirm that instances of `certutil.exe` are associated with the detected command-line parameters.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Utilize NDR or firewall logs to check for any unusual or unexpected outbound network connections that may correlate with the identified processes, especially to non-standard ports or unfamiliar domains.
  - **Check Logs for User Context:** Investigate the user context under which `certutil.exe` was executed by correlating with Windows Security logs, ensuring that the activity aligns with expected user behavior.
  - **Examine Event Historical Data:** Review the historical execution of `certutil.exe` through Sysmon logs to identify if this is a recurring behavior and to spot any patterns that may indicate ongoing malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for credential harvesting and subsequent unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Given the implications of NTLM coercion, a swift investigation is crucial to mitigate any potential security breach.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if `certutil.exe` is executed without the specified command-line parameters or if the tool has been renamed or repurposed to evade detection. Additionally, if a malicious actor employs alternative tools for NTLM coercion, this specific detection may fail. It is assumed that the `certutil.exe` utility is not commonly used within the organization's standard operations, so frequent legitimate usages should be rare, which could lead to false positives. Analysts should remain alert to updates to the `certutil.exe` functionalities that could be leveraged by attackers, making it essential to stay informed about legitimate uses versus potential abuse.

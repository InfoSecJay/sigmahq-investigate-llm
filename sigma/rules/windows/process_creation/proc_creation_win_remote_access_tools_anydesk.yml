  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of AnyDesk, a popular remote access tool, which may be exploited by adversaries to establish a command and control (C2) channel on a target system. The rule specifically looks for processes ending with `AnyDesk.exe` or `AnyDeskMSI.exe`, as well as system metadata that confirms the executable's identity, such as its description and product information. The underlying data sources leveraged include process creation logs from Windows, which record details about applications initiated on the system, including their paths, descriptions, and associated companies. The MITRE ATT&CK technique associated with this rule is T1219 (Remote Access Software), indicating its relevance in identifying potential misuse of legitimate software for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Confirm Process Details:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to verify the process creation logs pertaining to the alert, ensuring that the identified process is indeed `AnyDesk.exe` or `AnyDeskMSI.exe`.
  - **Check User Context:** Investigate the user account that initiated the AnyDesk process using Windows Security logs to assess whether the activity aligns with authorized usage or indicates potential compromise.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Review firewall and network logs to analyze any incoming or outgoing traffic patterns associated with the remote connection, looking for unusual destinations or data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Review Execution Context:** Utilize Sysmon logs to evaluate the command-line parameters and parent process IDs of AnyDesk's execution, determining if it was called in a suspicious manner or by an unexpected process.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is medium due to the potential risk associated with remote access tools being misused by adversaries. While legitimate business needs may exist, the execution of AnyDesk without proper context can indicate a breach or lateral movement within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not capture instances where AnyDesk has been whitelisted or allowed through application control policies, leading to potential blind spots in detection. Additionally, adversaries may obfuscate their activities using other legitimate remote access applications, thereby evading this specific rule. It is crucial for detection engineers to understand that effective monitoring should include alternative methods of identifying remote access activities beyond just the presence of these processes.

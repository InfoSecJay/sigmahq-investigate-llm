  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect the execution of the PowerTool application, a known hacking tool notorious for its capabilities, including killing processes, deleting file artifacts associated with those processes, and unloading drivers. The detection process specifically examines process creation logs, focusing on instances where the executable file names end with 'PowerTool.exe' or 'PowerTool64.exe'. Additionally, the rule checks for the `OriginalFileName` attribute, ensuring that it matches 'PowerTool.exe'. This is particularly relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the technique T1562.001, which addresses methods adversaries use to avoid detection. By leveraging Windows process creation logs, the rule provides insight into potentially malicious activities that may compromise system integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Activity:** Review the EDR logs for any recent executions of PowerTool to determine if the tool was launched intentionally or as part of a malicious action.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters associated with the PowerTool execution in the process creation logs to identify any suspicious commands or options used that indicate evasion attempts.
  - **Correlate with other logs:** Look into other relevant logs (e.g., Sysmon for process creation, file operations) to gather context on activities surrounding the execution of PowerTool, such as any unusual process relationships or file accesses.
  - **Review User Context:** Investigate the user accounts associated with the PowerTool execution. Check if the actions were performed by legitimate users or if there are any signs of credential misuse.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because the execution of PowerTool can indicate a significant threat to the integrity of the systems, potentially enabling further malicious actions like process manipulation or data exfiltration within the organization's environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the attacker disguises the PowerTool executable name or runs it through indirect means, such as aliasing or embedding within other legitimate processes (e.g., obfuscation). It also assumes that the system is properly logging process creation events and that any relevant antivirus or endpoint protection solutions are either not blocking PowerTool or are bypassed by the adversary. Additionally, if the system has not been updated to log these events correctly or has logging functionalities disabled, the detection may fail.

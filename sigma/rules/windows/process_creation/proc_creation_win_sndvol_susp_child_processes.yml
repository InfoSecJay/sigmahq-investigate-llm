  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Uncommon Child Processes Of SndVol.exe" is designed to identify potentially suspicious child processes spawned from the `SndVol.exe` executable, which serves as the Windows volume mixer. The rule specifically targets instances where `SndVol.exe` is the parent process, looking for uncommon child processes that typically signify malicious behavior. In particular, it flags creations of child processes where the executable is `rundll32.exe` with a command line containing `shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL`. This technique can be exploited by adversaries to execute unauthorized actions within the context of a legitimate application, thus evading standard detection mechanisms.
  The primary data sources leveraged for this detection rule include process creation logs from the Windows operating system, which provide insights into executable files being launched along with their command-line parameters. This information can be vital for identifying abnormal process behavior that deviates from typical usage patterns. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the tactics of execution (TA0002) and the technique of process injection (T1055).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs within your EDR platform for instances where `SndVol.exe` was the parent process. Ensure to assess the command-line parameters for associated child processes.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Use your NDR tools to monitor any unusual outbound connections initiated by the suspicious child process. Pay particular attention to connections that may relate to data exfiltration or command and control communication.
  - **Check for Related Events:** Look for concurrent alerts that may indicate a broader attack, such as unusual registry modifications or changes in user permissions related to the process associated with `SndVol.exe`.
  - **Run Behavioral Analysis:** Utilize your AV and EDR tools to perform a behavioral analysis on the child processes spawned from `SndVol.exe`. This can help to determine if they exhibit malicious behavior indicative of exploitation patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity in an enterprise environment due to the possibility that uncommon child processes of `SndVol.exe` can signal process injection or other malicious actions that compromise system security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire under circumstances where legitimate software uses unusual command lines with `SndVol.exe`, potentially leading to false negatives. Additionally, if adversaries employ obfuscation techniques to disguise their command line parameters, or if process creation logging is disabled or improperly configured, this could prevent detection. Engineers should verify the enforcement of process creation logging to ensure comprehensive telemetry is captured, and assess the possibility of legitimate processes mimicking suspicious behavior.

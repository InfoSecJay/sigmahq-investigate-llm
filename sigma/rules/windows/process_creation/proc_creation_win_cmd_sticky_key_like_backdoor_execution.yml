  ### Technical Context
  The "Sticky Key Like Backdoor Execution" detection rule is designed to identify the execution of malicious backdoors that exploit built-in accessibility tools on the Windows login screen. Specifically, this rule monitors for instances where the `winlogon.exe` process launches various executable images known for their association with system utilities, such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `utilman.exe`, among others. The key behavioral marker being detected is the command-line invocation of accessibility executables like `sethc.exe`, `utilman.exe`, and others, which can be leveraged by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or persistence on the host machine. 
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Privilege Escalation (TA0202) and the technique of Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1546.008). It serves to highlight potential adversarial methods that bypass standard security measures during the login phase, indicating heightened risk if identified.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate Process Creation Logs**: Review process creation logs containing entries for `winlogon.exe` to identify unusual parent-child process relationships and execution of the recognized accessibility tools.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Check command-line parameters associated with the identified executables for any suspicious strings or the presence of legitimate accessibility tools that have been invoked inappropriately.
  - **Correlate with Security Alerts**: Search through EDR and AV logs for any additional security alerts that correlate with the suspicious execution, focusing on endpoints where this behavior was detected.
  - **Review User Activity Logs**: Examine logs from proxy, VPN, and any remote access solutions to determine if any unusual login attempts or administrative activities were associated with the identified processes.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as critical due to the nature of the detected behavior, which indicates potential unauthorized privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms that could allow attackers to circumvent security controls and gain administrative access to sensitive systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may miss adversarial techniques if the malicious executables are renamed or altered to evade detection. Additionally, it assumes that the relevant telemetry is enabled and that the malicious executables are being executed from the expected locations. There may also be environments where legitimate administrative activities using these executables are common, which could lead to false positives and unnecessary investigations.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious Windows Update Agent Empty Cmdline" is designed to detect potential malicious activity associated with the Windows Update Agent (wuauclt.exe). This process is responsible for automatic updates in Windows environments, but adversaries may exploit its functionality to evade detection by launching it without necessary command-line flags, which can be indicative of malicious intent. The rule leverages process creation logs to identify instances where the command line for the wuauclt.exe process is present but contains no additional parameters, a behavior that deviates from its expected operational pattern. The detection correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1036 (Masquerading), as it highlights an instance of legitimate software being potentially manipulated to conduct malicious actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Details:** Utilize EDR to examine the details of the wuauclt.exe process invocation, including the user who initiated it and the parent process. Investigate any known associations with unwanted software.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Check for other instances of wuauclt.exe execution within the same time window to determine if this behavior is consistent or abnormal. Pay specific attention to any other instances lacking command-line flags.
  - **Check System Logs:** Utilize Windows Event Logs (Security, System) to correlate any logged events around the time of the alert, such as unusual user activity or settings changes related to the update service.
  - **Monitor for Subsequent Network Activity:** Review network connections made by wuauclt.exe using the network logs of the EDR or NDR systems. Identifying any outbound connections to suspect domains can indicate a compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of high is assigned to this alert due to the potential misuse of a system-critical process, which could indicate an evasion tactic employed by attackers to bypass security measures and compromise the system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where wuauclt.exe is legitimately invoked without command-line arguments due to specific operational requirements or scheduled updates. Additionally, if adversaries employ alternative techniques to invoke the update agent or utilize malware that impersonates its behavior, the rule may also fail to detect such activities. It is also assumed that there is consistent monitoring across all applicable systems.

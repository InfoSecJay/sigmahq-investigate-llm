  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious SysAidServer Child" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious child processes created by the SysAidServer application. It specifically identifies processes that are spawned by the Java executable (java.exe or javaw.exe) alongside the SysAidServer command line. This is particularly relevant in the context of known intrusions carried out by the MERCURY threat actor group, who have exploited vulnerabilities in unpatched systems to facilitate lateral movement within environments. The detection leverages process creation logs to monitor the relationships between parent and child processes, providing insight into potentially suspicious activity that could indicate an ongoing attack. The rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques related to lateral movement (T1210).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Relationships:** Use the EDR to check the relationship between the identified child process and the SysAidServer parent process. Confirm that the child process exhibits suspicious behavior or is not a known legitimate child process.
  - **Inspect Command Line Arguments:** Review the command line arguments for the detected child process using Windows Security logs or Sysmon logs to identify any malicious commands or flags that could indicate exploitation.
  - **Check for Known Indicators:** Cross-reference the observed processes and command lines against threat intelligence feeds or known indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the MERCURY actor group to establish context.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Investigate any associated network connections from the child process using EDR and firewall logs to identify if there are any unauthorized external communications initiated by the detected processes.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for lateral movement associated with this detection. While not all instances indicate outright compromise, the suspicious nature of child processes from SysAidServer warrants timely investigation to mitigate any risk of further malicious activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where SysAidServer is not deployed or utilized, potentially leading to missed detection of related activities. Additionally, if the parent process is mimicked or spawned by a different legitimate application, the detection may not trigger. Furthermore, adversaries may use techniques to obfuscate their activity, such as renaming processes or using different command lines, which could render this rule ineffective. Analysts should remain aware that false negatives could occur under these conditions.

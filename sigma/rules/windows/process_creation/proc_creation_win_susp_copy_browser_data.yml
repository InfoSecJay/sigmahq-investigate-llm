  Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser.
  Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future.
  Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule “Potential Browser Data Stealing” is designed to detect unauthorized attempts by adversaries to access and potentially exfiltrate stored credentials from commonly used web browsers. These browsers often save sensitive information such as usernames and passwords in an encrypted format within a specified credential store. The detection logic primarily focuses on process creation logs, examining command-line parameters to identify specific copy or move commands associated with recognized browser user data directories (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). The rule captures activities involving widely used Windows command-line tools like `xcopy.exe` and `robocopy.exe`, which can indicate malicious intent when manipulating browser data files. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access and the specific technique T1555.003.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Investigate any alerts triggering this rule within the EDR platform to determine the user and process involved in the file manipulation activity.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Examine Windows Security logs related to process creation for the detected instances, paying close attention to the sequence of executed commands leading to the suspicious activity.
  - **Inspect File Access Logs:** Review file access logs for related browser directories to confirm if any credentials files were indeed copied or moved during the identified activity.
  - **Query Network Traffic:** Analyze any outbound network traffic from the suspected host to identify if data was exfiltrated following the suspicious command execution.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified at a medium severity level due to the potential compromise of sensitive user credentials, which could lead to unauthorized account access. Prompt investigation is essential as it may indicate an active data exfiltration attempt.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several recognized blind spots with this detection rule. It may not fire if adversaries utilize obfuscated command-line arguments, employ alternate tools outside the defined parameters, or manipulate browser settings to prevent file access. Additionally, if credential stores are not stored in the specified paths or have been moved or encrypted differently, the detection may fail. It's also crucial to note that legitimate users may unintentionally trigger this rule while performing authorized administrative tasks.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Reg Add BitLocker" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious modifications to BitLocker registry keys made via the `reg.exe` utility on Windows systems. Specifically, this rule identifies processes that execute commands containing specific arguments indicative of registry changes related to BitLocker security settings. The rule focuses on calls to add values to the registry path `\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`, which is critical for managing BitLocker encryption. By monitoring the command-line parameters for key strings associated with unauthorized BitLocker configurations, the rule leverages process creation logs as a primary data source. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1486, which pertains to Data Encrypted for Impact.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your EDR system for any instances of `reg.exe` executing with the detected command line arguments. Look for relevant parent processes that could indicate how the command was invoked.
    
  - **Check for Anomalous User Activity:** Investigate the user account associated with the alert for any unusual behavior or access patterns that may indicate that an attacker is attempting to manipulate disk encryption settings.
  - **Cross-reference with Security Logs:** Utilize Windows Security logs to identify if there were any preceding or following events related to user logins or system changes that coincide with the detected command execution.
  - **Evaluate Endpoint Protection Responses:** Review the alerts or logs from your AV and endpoint protection solutions for any related detections or quarantines on the endpoint executing the suspicious command.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is categorized as high due to the potential implications of unauthorized changes to BitLocker settings, which could lead to data loss or system compromise. Timely investigation is crucial to mitigate any possible attacks leveraging encryption for impact.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `reg.exe` is heavily whitelisted or where users have legitimate usage patterns that match the detection criteria. Additionally, if an adversary uses custom scripts or tools instead of the standard `reg.exe` utility, the detection may evade alerting. It is assumed that appropriate logging levels are enabled; if baseline logging is insufficient, detections may be missed.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies when the `dnscmd.exe` tool is employed to install a DNS plugin DLL through the `ServerLevelPluginDll` parameter in the Windows registry. Such activities are critical as this allows code execution in the context of the DNS server itself, creating potential backdoors or enabling malware to operate at a significant level in the network environment. To promote visibility, the rule specifically inspects the process creation logs for the invocation of `dnscmd.exe` with relevant command-line arguments indicating malicious or unauthorized usage. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1574.002 (DLL Side-Loading) and T1112 (Modification of Registry) under the tactic of Defense Evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize your EDR to search for instances of `dnscmd.exe` being executed, focusing on timestamps and user context. This will help identify if the execution is legitimate or part of a potential security incident.
    
  - **Examine Registry Changes**: Check for modifications to the DNS registry keys indicating the addition of the `ServerLevelPluginDll`. Use tools such as Sysinternals or PowerShell to list recent registry changes relevant to DNS configurations.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Use network monitoring tools (such as NDR) to identify any unusual DNS traffic patterns that may indicate exploitation or manipulation of the DNS infrastructure following the DLL installation.
  - **Analyze Related Events**: Investigate any other alerts or log entries that correspond with the time frame of the `dnscmd.exe` execution. Correlating this information can help assess the broader context of the potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for significant network impact through unauthorized DNS manipulation, alerts from this rule should be treated with high severity. The installation of malicious DNS plugins can facilitate further exploitation and lateral movement within the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary employs tactics to obfuscate `dnscmd.exe` execution, such as renaming the binary or executing it from a compromised trusted application. Additionally, if logging is misconfigured or insufficient, it may fail to capture critical process creation data necessary for detection. Analysts should also be aware of legitimate uses of the DNS command-line tool, which could lead to false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Use of Remote.exe" is designed to detect the execution of the `remote.exe` utility, which is a component of the Windows SDK primarily used in debugging scenarios. This particular executable can facilitate Application Whitelist (AWL) bypasses and execute potentially malicious code by enabling the execution of remote files. The detection rule looks for instances where the `Image` field in process creation logs ends with `\remote.exe` and verifies its `OriginalFileName` is also `remote.exe`. This rule utilizes Windows Process Creation logs, crucial for monitoring the execution of processes within the system, and is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically technique T1127. This technique highlights the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes, which is common in various attack scenarios.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation logs in Sysmon or Windows Event Logs for instances involving `remote.exe`. Look for suspicious command-line arguments or parent process relationships that may indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize your EDR solution to analyze the behavior of the `remote.exe` process. Determine whether it initiated any unusual or unexpected child processes or attempted unauthorized network connections.
  - **Examine Network Traffic:** Investigate network communications related to the execution of `remote.exe` using NDR tools. Look for connections to known malicious IPs, or any unusual outbound traffic that coincides with the timing of the processes.
  - **Validate Approved Software List:** Cross-reference any detected instances of `remote.exe` with your organizationâ€™s approved software list to rule out legitimate uses, such as approved installations of the Windows SDK and Debugging Tools.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the dual nature of `remote.exe` as both a legitimate debugging tool and a potential vector for executing malicious commands. The presence of such indicators warrants further investigation to confirm whether the execution is benign or indicative of an attempt to bypass security mechanisms.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  Detecting the use of `remote.exe` may be limited by approved deployments of WinDbg, making it possible for legitimate activities to generate false positives. Additionally, if an adversary alters the file name or executes the tool from a non-standard location, this rule may fail to trigger. It is crucial for detection engineers to be aware that alternative methods, including the use of other utilities that serve similar purposes, might also bypass detection.

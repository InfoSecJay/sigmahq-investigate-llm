title: New Remote Desktop Connection Initiated Via Mstsc.EXE
id: 954f0af7-62dd-418f-b3df-a84bc2c7a774
status: test
description: |
  Detects the usage of "mstsc.exe" with the "/v" flag to initiate a connection to a remote server.
  Adversaries may use valid accounts to log into a computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the initiation of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections using the Microsoft Terminal Services Client (MSTSC.EXE) application, specifically when the "/v" command-line argument is employed. The rule looks for instances where wzsc.exe is executed and matches command-line arguments that direct the application to connect to a remote server. The use of RDP is significant for attackers, as it allows them to leverage valid user credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems within an enterprise environment. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactic of Lateral Movement, specifically technique T1021.001 (Remote Desktop Protocol), which indicates an adversary attempting to move laterally within a network using valid credentials to access another host.
  The rule operates by monitoring process creation logs in Windows and analyzing specific patterns in command-line parameters associated with MSTSC.EXE. Telemetry sources involved include Windows Security and Sysmon logs to capture processes and their command-line arguments accurately.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze process creation logs for any instances of MSTSC.EXE being launched, focusing on the timestamp and user context.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments**: Investigate the command-line parameters associated with detected MSTSC.EXE executions, specifically looking for the "/v" flag, and record the target IP or hostname.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity**: Check Windows Security logs to verify user activity around the time of RDP usage, ensuring that the connecting user is recognized and has valid reasons for RDP access.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Use NDR tools to monitor any connections to unusual or unauthorized hosts which may indicate potential lateral movement or misuse of RDP credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level of this alert is due to the fact that legitimate users may utilize Remote Desktop to perform authorized tasks. However, unauthorized RDP access using valid credentials represents a significant security threat, warranting immediate investigation to ascertain the context of the connection.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several blind spots associated with this rule. For instance, if the RDP session is initiated through alternative software or methods not captured as MSTSC.EXE (e.g., third-party RDP clients), the rule would not generate an alert. Additionally, legitimate use cases such as system administrators performing maintenance or accessing production systems may lead to false positives if not carefully validated. It is assumed that organizational policies around RDP use are well documented so that the investigative response can distinguish between routine administrative tasks and malicious activities effectively.

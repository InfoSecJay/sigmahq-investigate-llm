  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "New User Created Via Net.EXE" is designed to detect the creation of local user accounts through the use of the `net.exe` command, specifically when users are added using the command line interface. This rule leverages process creation logs, focusing on instances where an executable named `net.exe` or `net1.exe` is executed with command line arguments containing both "user" and "add". By monitoring the command line inputs and the originating process image, the rule aims to identify potentially unauthorized user account creations, which is a common tactic in persistence strategies employed by attackers, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic "Persistence" and technique T1136.001.
  The technical data source for this detection primarily includes process creation telemetry, enabling the identification of processes that may impact system administration and user management. The emphasis on `net.exe` signifies a focus on Windows command line activity, crucial for user account management, and reinforces the need for vigilance in monitoring such activities that could indicate malicious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Utilize EDR tools to search for process creation events specifically for `net.exe` or `net1.exe`, and identify the associated command line parameters to ascertain the context of user creation.
    
  - **Analyze User Account Changes:** Cross-reference the creation of new user accounts with Windows Security logs (Event ID 4720) to verify whether the newly created accounts are legitimate or potentially unauthorized.
  - **Examine Source User Activity:** Investigate the historical activity of the user who executed the command to determine if there are any previous suspicious behaviors or if the command was run from an anomalous location.
  - **Check for Related Suspicious Activities:** Use the SIEM to identify any other related activities in close temporal proximity to the user creation event, such as privilege escalations or unauthorized access attempts, that may indicate a broader attack vector.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized user account creation, which can be leveraged for further escalations or lateral movement within the network. Given that local user creation often entails changes to system access, prompt investigation is essential to mitigate possible insider threats or compromised accounts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One notable limitation of this rule is its reliance on specific command line parameters; attackers may use different methods to create accounts, such as PowerShell scripts or direct modifications through AD, which would not trigger this detection. Additionally, the rule may generate false positives in scenarios where legitimate administrators create new user accounts. There is also an assumption that logging and monitoring for process creation are enabled and functioning correctly; hence, this rule may not fire in environments where logging is insufficient or disabled.

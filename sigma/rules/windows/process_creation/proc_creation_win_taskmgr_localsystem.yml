  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Taskmgr as LOCAL_SYSTEM" is designed to detect the execution of `taskmgr.exe`, the Windows Task Manager, specifically when it is invoked in the context of the `LOCAL_SYSTEM` user. This is noteworthy because the Task Manager is typically run by users with interactive access and is not usually executed from a system account. The rule evaluates process creation logs to identify instances where the process is initiated under unusual circumstances, such as being initiated by the `LOCAL_SYSTEM` account. The data sources utilized for this detection include Windows Event Logs specifically focused on process creation events, which record details like the name of the executable, the user under which it was run, and the command-line parameters if applicable. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1036, which relates to defense evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process Context:** Use the EDR tool to confirm the user context in which `taskmgr.exe` was executed and examine if it was indeed running under `LOCAL_SYSTEM`. 
  - **Check Execution History:** Review the command-line arguments for the task manager by investigating Windows Event Logs or EDR telemetry to see if any unusual parameters were used upon execution.
  - **Correlate with Other Activities:** Cross-reference the time of this detection with other logs (e.g., Windows Security Logs, Sysmon events) to identify any suspicious activities or potential lateral movement attempts that may have occurred around the same time.
  - **Review Recent Changes:** Check for any recent system changes or misconfigurations that could enable `taskmgr.exe` to run as `LOCAL_SYSTEM`, including any unauthorized modifications to Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or scheduled tasks.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for an adversary to misuse legitimate system processes like Task Manager to evade detection measures or perform unauthorized actions within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this detection rule can effectively flag unusual Task Manager executions, it may not fire if an attacker uses alternative methods to execute processes or if the logging level is insufficient to capture such events. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks may trigger false positives if not appropriately scoped. Assumptions include the expectation that adequate logging is enabled for process creation and that the local environment has not been tampered with to suppress these logs.

  Detect VBoxDrvInst.exe run with parameters allowing processing INF file.
  This allows to create values in the registry and install drivers.
  For example one could use this technique to obtain persistence via modifying one of Run or RunOnce registry keys

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule identifies suspicious usage of the `VBoxDrvInst.exe` executable, specifically looking for command-line parameters that indicate it is being used to process INF files. This behavior is significant because processing INF files may allow an attacker to create registry entries or install drivers, potentially facilitating persistence mechanisms by modifying keys such as `Run` or `RunOnce`. The rule relies on data collected from Windows process creation logs, focusing on `Image` paths and `CommandLine` arguments that include specific terms related to driver installation. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112: Modify Registry, indicating a possible evasion tactic employed by adversaries trying to maintain access to a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Origin:** Examine the EDR logs to determine the source from where `VBoxDrvInst.exe` was executed, identifying any unusual parent processes or locations that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Utilize Windows Registry auditing logs to check if any unexpected modifications were made to the `Run` or `RunOnce` keys shortly after the execution of `VBoxDrvInst.exe`.
  - **Analyze User Behavior:** Investigate the user account associated with the execution of `VBoxDrvInst.exe` to determine if their activity appears legitimate or if there have been signs of credential compromise or unusual behavior.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Look at network logs (e.g., firewall or proxy logs) to detect any outbound connections made shortly before or after the suspicious execution of the `VBoxDrvInst.exe`, as these could provide insights into potential data exfiltration efforts.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as medium, as it points to a potential evasion technique that can lead to persistence on a compromised system. While not immediately critical, it should be treated with caution and prioritized for further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where `VBoxDrvInst.exe` is used legitimately, such as during the installation of VirtualBox Guest Additions, which could lead to false negatives. Additionally, if an adversary employs obfuscation techniques or modifies the executable name, the rule may fail to detect the suspicious behavior. It is assumed that users with administrative privileges may run this tool without triggering alerts, so diligent monitoring of privileged account activity is essential.

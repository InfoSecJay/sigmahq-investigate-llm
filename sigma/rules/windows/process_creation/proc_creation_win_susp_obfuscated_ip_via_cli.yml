  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Obfuscated IP Via CLI" is designed to detect suspicious command-line activity on Windows systems where encoded or obfuscated forms of IP addresses are used. This can be indicative of malware or other unauthorized activity attempting to communicate with external hosts. The rule focuses on processes that are commonly associated with network activity, specifically `ping.exe` and `arp.exe`, monitoring their command-line arguments for patterns that suggest the presence of obfuscated IP addresses. This includes hexadecimal notations, octal representations, and URLs that can highlight attempts to connect to potentially malicious destinations.
  The rule utilizes data sources such as process creation logs from Windows, specifically examining the command-line parameters. It correlates command invocations against a set of predefined patterns that match obfuscated IP addresses. Additionally, the rule references the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly the Discovery tactic (T1083), as this behavior often involves reconnaissance activities by adversaries attempting to identify or exploit network configurations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the command-line arguments of processes like `ping.exe` and `arp.exe` in the EDR to identify any instances where obfuscated IP addresses are detected.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize the Network Detection and Response (NDR) tool to inspect outgoing connections corresponding to the identified processes, checking for unusual traffic patterns post the command execution.
  - **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence:** Lookup the resolved IP addresses against threat intelligence feeds to establish if they are associated with known malicious IPs or malicious infrastructure.
  - **Check for Further Indicators:** Investigate other security logs, including Sysmon logs for process creation and command line usage, as well as Firewall logs, to identify if there are wider implications or connections that may indicate compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is set to medium due to the potential for obfuscation techniques to disguise malicious command execution, which can suggest a more sophisticated threat actor's tactics. Given the ability of these techniques to bypass standard security measures, prompt investigation is warranted.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if encoded or obfuscated IP addresses are invoked through means not covered in the selection criteria, such as scripts or unusual executables not captured by `ping.exe` or `arp.exe`. Additionally, some benign applications might utilize similar obfuscation, potentially leading to false positives. Engineers should also consider that adversaries can adapt by using non-obfuscated IPs or less common commands to evade detection. Therefore, it's critical to maintain situational awareness and supplement this rule with context and anomalies from a broader oversight perspective.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially suspicious activity involving the importation of `.reg` files using the `reg.exe` utility on Windows systems. The rule specifically looks for instances where `reg.exe` is executed with command-line arguments containing the `import` keyword, along with paths that are typically associated with temporary user files or application data. Such behaviors may indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or introduce malicious registry settings stealthily, fitting within the MITRE ATT&CK framework's defense evasion tactics, specifically under technique T1112: Modify Registry.
  The log source for this rule is process creation logs, which provide details about the execution of processes, including the image name (`reg.exe`) and the original filename. The command-line parameters can reveal the specific actions taken by the tool, whereas the path evidence allows for faster identification of potentially malicious imports from user-specific or temporary directories, which are often targets for malicious actors seeking to execute unauthorized changes without detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Examine the process details of the detected `reg.exe` instance in the EDR to validate its origin and examine its parent process for potential malicious behavior.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command line used with `reg.exe` in conjunction with the Sysmon logs to identify the exact `.reg` file being imported and its contents, which may contain malicious registry entries.
  - **Investigate User Context:** Cross-reference the user account executing the command against a user access log to determine if they have a legitimate need to modify the registry or if the activity is suspicious.
  - **Inspect Registry Changes:** Query the registry for changes made as a result of the import, particularly in the identified paths, looking for entries that deviate from expected values or seem to correspond with known malicious indicators.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is rated as medium because while importing a registry file is a legitimate action, it can also indicate attempts to evade defenses or make unauthorized changes, which could lead to a compromised system state.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not capture legitimate cases where users need to import registry files from these paths, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may obfuscate their actions by using legitimate tools or modifying registry keys through less suspicious methods that do not utilize `reg.exe`. Furthermore, if an adversary uses PowerShell or other scripting languages to make registry modifications directly rather than importing `.reg` files, this rule will not trigger.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Fsutil Drive Enumeration" aims to detect malicious attempts by attackers to enumerate connected drives on a Windows system using the `fsutil` command-line tool. In particular, it looks for instances where `fsutil.exe` is executed with a command line that includes the keyword "drives." The primary data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs, which capture information about the executions of processes on the system, specifically focusing on the `fsutil.exe` executable. When an adversary runs this command, it can provide them with insights into the drives attached to the system, which could be leveraged for further exploitation or data exfiltration. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Discovery (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1120).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation logs in your EDR or SIEM for entries that indicate the execution of `fsutil.exe` with the argument "drives" around the time the alert was triggered.
  - **Assess Command-Line Context:** Review the command-line parameters associated with the `fsutil` execution for any other suspicious arguments or patterns that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Examine User Context:** Identify the user account that executed the command to determine if it aligns with typical administrative behaviors or if it appears suspicious based on user activity history.
  - **Check for Related Activities:** Analyze network activity and other endpoint behaviors that align with this enumeration; look for subsequent commands or actions that may suggest post-enumeration exploitation.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is classified as low due to the potential for false positives from standard administrative tasks; however, it still warrants attention as it could indicate reconnaissance activities leading to more significant threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `fsutil.exe` command is executed in a manner that does not include the "drives" argument or if execution occurs in environments with high usage of legitimate software that may cause similar command patterns, potentially leading to false positives. Furthermore, adversaries could also obfuscate their command usage or utilize alternative methods for drive enumeration that this rule would not capture.

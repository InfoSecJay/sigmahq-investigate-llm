  ### Technical Context
  The "Fsutil Drive Enumeration" detection rule is designed to identify potential reconnaissance activities performed by attackers using the `fsutil.exe` utility on Windows systems. This command-line tool can be exploited to enumerate all connected drives on a machine, providing an attacker with critical information about the environment. The rule leverages process creation logs to detect the execution of `fsutil.exe`, specifically looking for the command lines that contain the keyword 'drives'. By monitoring for these activities, the SOC can pinpoint instances where an unauthorized user may be attempting to gather system information, which could be a precursor to further malicious actions. 
  The primary data sources involved in this rule are process creation logs that capture details about executable files and their corresponding command-line parameters, allowing for effective tracking of potentially harmful behavior.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Correlate the detected instance of `fsutil.exe` execution with the source system's user activity logs to determine whether the command was run by an authorized user or process.
  - Utilize EDR to analyze any associated processes that may have spawned `fsutil.exe`, paying specific attention to the parent-child relationship of processes to identify anomalous behavior.
  - Check network logs via the NGFW and Proxy to review any external communications initiated from the host system around the time of the `fsutil` execution, which may indicate further malicious intent.
  - Review system and event logs to identify any other unusual activities or patterns surrounding the use of `fsutil`, particularly in the context of a broader engagement with the impacted host.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets the execution of **SharpLdapWhoami**, a tool utilized for querying the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) on domain controllers. By examining process creation logs, the rule identifies instances where the SharpLdapWhoami executable is run, particularly monitoring for specific command-line arguments that indicate an attempt to use various methods of authentication (NTLM, Kerberos, or Negotiate). The rule leverages data from Windows endpoint telemetry, focusing on event logs that capture process creation activities. It correlates detection with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, specifically attacking the Discovery tactic under technique T1033 (Credential Extraction). Investigating this tool's usage is critical, as it can potentially support reconnaissance efforts in an environment, revealing sensitive information about user authentication and domain structures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the endpoint using your EDR tools to confirm if the SharpLdapWhoami process was executed. Look for related parent processes to understand the context of the execution.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments:** Review the full command-line parameters associated with the process instance to determine if any atypical or suspicious arguments were used, especially concerning authentication methods.
  - **Cross-reference User Activity:** Investigate the account that executed the tool using Windows Security logs, determining if the account has a legitimate reason for running SharpLdapWhoami.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Utilize network logs to evaluate any LDAP queries made to domain controllers during the time frame of the execution. Correlate this activity with other potential indicators of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as **high severity** due to the potential risk that the execution of SharpLdapWhoami can pose, as it may facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive domain-level information. Quick investigation is essential to mitigate any possible reconnaissance or exploitation attempts in the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may miss false negatives when legitimate applications utilize the same command-line flags or if the tool is renamed post-compilation, as specifically defined in the rule conditions. Additionally, if an adversary employs obfuscation techniques or custom scripts to mimic legitimate process behavior or command-line arguments, this alert might not fire. It is assumed that the system's EDR and logs are adequately configured and monitored to capture all necessary events; any gaps in logging may lead to incomplete visibility into the activity.

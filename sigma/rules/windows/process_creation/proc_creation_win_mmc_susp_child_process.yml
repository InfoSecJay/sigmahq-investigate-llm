  ### Technical Context
  The rule titled "MMC Spawning Windows Shell" is designed to detect suspicious instances of command-line executables that are initiated by the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), typically starting with the `mmc.exe` process. This type of behavior can be indicative of lateral movement techniques employed by attackers to execute commands or scripts on target systems. The rule specifically looks for processes that are spawned from `mmc.exe`, including various command interpreters such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `bash.exe`, as well as other scripting contexts like `wscript.exe` and `cscript.exe`. It leverages the Windows process creation logs to identify these parent-child relationships, focusing on command-line parameters that reveal the execution context.
  In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this detection rule pertains to the tactic of lateral movement, specifically the technique T1021.003, which highlights how attackers can leverage trusted administrative tools like MMC to propagate malicious commands in a network environment. By focusing on known executable paths and process creation events, this rule provides a means of identifying potentially malicious activities that could otherwise go undetected.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Hierarchy:** Examine the process tree using your EDR to understand the relationship between `mmc.exe` and the spawned process, focusing on the parent-child relationship to identify unusual artifacts.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Look at the command-line arguments associated with the detected processes to determine if they reflect standard administrative actions or could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Assess Other Security Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application) for related events that may provide context to the action taken, including user logins or account activity.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Utilize NDR logs to analyze any related network connections that may have occurred at the same time as the execution of the suspicious process to identify potential data exfiltration or further lateral movement.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high-severity level assigned to this alert, it indicates a significant potential for abuse of trusted tools, which may lead to broader compromise within the enterprise environment. Immediate investigation is warranted to determine whether the activity is part of a legitimate administrative task or an indicator of malicious exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the parent process does not generate logs expected by the detection logic, such as specific configurations of process isolation. It assumes that logging is enabled for process creation across all monitored systems. Additionally, if an adversary uses a custom-built application or leverages legitimate processes in a legitimate manner, the detection may be evaded. Awareness of these conditions is crucial to understanding the limitations of the detection capabilities.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious Execution Location Of Wermgr.EXE" is designed to detect instances where the Windows Error Reporting Manager (wermgr.exe) is executed from atypical directories that do not align with expected system paths. This rule focuses specifically on process creation logs where the image "wermgr.exe" is found, indicating that the executable is being run. The legitimate instances of wermgr.exe typically reside in directories like `C:\Windows\System32\`, `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\`, or `C:\Windows\WinSxS\`. However, if this process is triggered from other locations, it can indicate potential malicious activity, such as a payload being executed by an adversary.
  This detection is particularly relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of execution (TA0002), which encompasses techniques such as executing unauthorized or malicious applications to establish footholds within the environment. By monitoring the paths from which wermgr.exe is executed, SOC analysts can uncover suspicious behaviors that could signal a lateral movement or an attempt to deliver malware.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Investigate the process creation details in your EDR solution for any anomalies related to wermgr.exe, such as command-line arguments or parent processes associated with its execution.
  - **Review File Paths:** Verify the execution path of wermgr.exe against known legitimate directories, looking specifically for instances where it was run from unusual or unexpected locations that might suggest malicious behavior.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Utilize network logs to check for any suspicious outbound connections made by the process, as well as any other processes that may have been launched by wermgr.exe to determine if there is an ongoing malicious campaign.
  - **Inspect System Changes:** Examine Windows Security and System logs for any unusual changes related to system files or permissions around the time wermgr.exe was executed, which may indicate tampering or exploitation attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential risk associated with the execution of system processes from non-standard directories, which is a common tactic employed by threat actors to bypass defenses and execute unapproved code.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized blind spot is that legitimate applications or scripts may also use custom locations for legitimate purposes, leading to false positives. Additionally, the rule may not fire if attackers use obfuscation techniques or rename wermgr.exe to evade detection. It is also essential to assume that the application might be executed as a secondary process or from an alternate executable that does not trigger the rule, potentially allowing malicious behavior to go unnoticed.

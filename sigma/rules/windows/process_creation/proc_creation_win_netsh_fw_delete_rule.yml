  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify malicious or unauthorized attempts to delete firewall rules within a Windows environment through the use of `netsh.exe`, a command-line utility that allows configuration of the network settings on Windows systems. The rule looks specifically for process creation events where `netsh.exe` is invoked with command-line arguments indicating the deletion of firewall rules. The relevant log sources include Windows process creation logs, which record information about running processes, including the image name and command line parameters. By monitoring the command arguments for keywords like `firewall` and `delete`, as well as filtering out known benign executions (e.g., from `Dropbox.exe`), the rule helps detect potential evasion attempts that align with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.004 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in the EDR for instances of `netsh.exe` executing with the command line containing 'firewall delete', noting any unusual parent processes.
  - **Review Firewall Logs:** Investigate Windows Firewall logs to confirm whether the deleted rules correspond to legitimate administrative activities or if they suggest malicious attempts to alter firewall settings.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Examine user activity around the time of the detected action; look for unusual logins or sessions that could indicate unauthorized access or escalation of privileges.
  - **Correlate with Proxy Logs:** If applicable, check proxy logs for related outgoing traffic that may correlate with the time the firewall rule deletion was detected to see if there are any suspicious external connections.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity, as unauthorized modifications to firewall rules could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures and facilitate further malicious actions within the network. 
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `netsh.exe` is not used for firewall configurations or where alternative methods for disabling or altering firewall rules are employed. Additionally, if an adversary has sufficient privileges to manipulate firewall settings through other processes or scripts, this detection may be bypassed. Assumptions include that normal administrative practices will not typically involve the deletion of firewall rules, thus creating channels for false positives.

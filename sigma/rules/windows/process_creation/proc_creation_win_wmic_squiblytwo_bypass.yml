  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential SquiblyTwo Technique Execution" is designed to detect instances of the SquiblyTwo attack technique, which is a method for bypassing security controls using a renamed Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool. Specifically, the rule monitors for the execution of WMIC by checking for processes that match known indicators such as IMPhash values associated with malicious versions of WMIC. The detection schema involves leveraging process creation logs to filter for evidence of WMIC execution and specific command-line parameters, such as those including 'format:' and 'http', which can indicate attempts to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation), T1059.005 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows PowerShell), and T1220 (XMLElement Injection).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the EDR for the process execution records that triggered the alert, focusing on the process ID, parent process, and any involved command-line parameters. This can help identify how WMIC was invoked.
  - **Analyze IMPhash Values:** Review the IMPhash values captured in the alert against a list of known malicious hashes. Use threat intelligence databases or internal repositories to confirm any matches.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Analyze network connection logs from your NDR or firewall to determine if there were outbound communications linked to the WMIC process execution. Look for connections to suspicious or unrecognized external IPs.
  - **Examine Command History and User Activity:** Review PowerShell logs and other script execution logs to assess any prior activity by the user account associated with the WMIC execution. This may uncover earlier stages of attack or additional unauthorized actions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity in an enterprise environment due to the potential for significant system compromise and data exfiltration facilitated by malicious WMIC usage. Investigating such alerts promptly is crucial to mitigating risks associated with ongoing attacks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in cases where WMIC is executed in a non-standard manner, or if the hash values of the malicious binary change, potentially evading detection. Additionally, if the adversary uses a legitimate and updated version of WMIC or renames it without triggering the known IMPhash patterns, detection may fail. It is essential to assume that adversaries are capable of evolving their techniques to bypass such detections.

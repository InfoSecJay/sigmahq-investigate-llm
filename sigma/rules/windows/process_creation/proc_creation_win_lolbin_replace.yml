  ### Technical Context
  The "Replace.exe Usage" detection rule monitors for the execution of the `Replace.exe` command-line utility, which is commonly utilized to replace files on Windows systems. It specifically looks for instances where `Replace.exe` is invoked with the `-a` argument, which allows for file replacement actions that could potentially be malicious in nature. The technical data sources involved in this rule include process creation logs, which capture relevant details regarding the execution of applications, including the command-line parameters utilized. As an investigation reference, this rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Command and Control (T1105), where an adversary may replace legitimate files with malwaresque files to further their malicious objectives.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine process creation logs in your EDR tool to identify instances of `Replace.exe` being executed, noting the time, user context, and the command-line arguments employed.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Focus on the command-line parameters passed with `Replace.exe`, particularly looking for the `-a` switch, which indicates potentially suspicious behavior. Verify the legitimacy of file paths to ensure they are not pointing to unrecognized or compromised locations.
  - **Check for Related Network Activities:** Use network detection tools to track any outbound communications from the host where `Replace.exe` was executed, which may indicate a larger compromise involving command and control behavior.
  - **Inspect File Changes:** Investigate recent file changes on the system that may have coincided with the execution of `Replace.exe`, using file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with medium severity due to the potential risk posed by the misuse of `Replace.exe` in compromising system integrity and confidentiality. While not an immediate threat on its own, it warrants investigation to identify possible file replacement activities that could facilitate later stages of an attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the execution of `Replace.exe` occurs without the `-a` argument or doesnâ€™t conform to the exact command-line pattern specified. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes alternative means (such as scripting or other file manipulation tools) to achieve similar outcomes, this rule will not detect those actions. It assumes that `Replace.exe` is executed within contexts that generate standard process creation logs, and any environment setup that suppresses such logging will lead to a failure to detect these events.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - WebBrowserPassView Execution" is designed to detect instances of the execution of the WebBrowserPassView.exe process, a widely known password recovery tool used to reveal stored passwords from various web browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera. The alert is generated by monitoring Windows process creation events, particularly focusing on instances where the executable name ends with 'WebBrowserPassView.exe.' 
  By leveraging process creation logs, the rule identifies malicious or suspicious use of this legitimate software, which is often indicative of credential access attempts by threat actors. The MITRE ATT&CK framework classifies this detection under the tactic of "Credential Access," specifically under technique T1555.003, which pertains to "Credentials from Web Browsers." As such, this rule plays an essential role in promoting awareness of potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs within your EDR solution for occurrences of 'WebBrowserPassView.exe.' Check for unusual or unexpected execution patterns.
    
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Look up the user account associated with the execution of the application in SIEM logs to discern if the execution aligns with legitimate user activity or if it appears anomalous.
    
  - **Examine Network Detections:** Utilize your NDR solution to inspect any outgoing network connections originating from the host running WebBrowserPassView.exe, confirming if any data exfiltration activities are in play.
    
  - **Assess Other Security Logs:** Analyze Windows Event Logs (Security, System, and Application) and AV logs to determine if additional malware or potentially unwanted applications were detected alongside this execution.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with the unauthorized use of password recovery tools, which can lead to significant exposure of sensitive credentials in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the process is executed under alternate names or if the executable is renamed, hence defeating the detection mechanism. Additionally, legitimate use of WebBrowserPassView.exe may lead to false positives in environments where users are allowed to utilize such tools for recovery purposes. Other assumed blind spots include environments lacking extensive logging capabilities or those not performing regular monitoring of process creation logs.

  ### Technical Context
  The rule "Suspicious UltraVNC Execution" detects potentially malicious usage of the UltraVNC remote desktop software by analyzing process creation events in a Windows environment. Specifically, it looks for command line arguments that indicate the tool is set up to automatically reconnect and connect to a remote host, which can be indicative of lateral movement tactics employed by threat actors such as the Gamaredon group. The command arguments `-autoreconnect`, `-connect`, and `-id:` in combination suggest that an attacker may be trying to establish a persistent remote access mechanism without the need for user interaction. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of lateral movement and remote services exploitation (T1021.005).
  The detection leverages Windows process creation logs, specifically focusing on the command line parameters passed during the execution of the UltraVNC software. By triangulating these parameters, incident responders can identify and investigate potential unauthorized remote access attempts utilizing this software.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows security logs for the process creation events related to UltraVNC (e.g., using EDR tools). Focus on the specifics of the command line and Verify its source and legitimacy.
  - **Examine Network Connection Logs:** Utilize network detection and response (NDR) solutions to analyze any outbound connections established by the UltraVNC process. This helps identify suspicious or unauthorized remote endpoints.
  - **Review User Activity:** Investigate user account activities associated with the execution of UltraVNC to ascertain whether they had legitimate business needs or if an anomaly exists. Validate all accounts that might have administrative rights to run such software.
  - **Cross-Reference with Proxy Logs:** Look into proxy logs to track any unusual external traffic to and from IP addresses engaged by the UltraVNC sessions. This can help pinpoint unauthorized data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert raised by this detection rule is categorized as high severity due to its indication of potential lateral movement and remote access by an unauthorized user or threat actor. Immediate investigation is crucial to prevent further compromise of the network infrastructure.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under certain conditions such as if the UltraVNC application is executed without the suspicious command line flags, or if the execution is closely monitored and manipulated by sophisticated adversaries. Furthermore, false negatives may occur if the malicious actor modifies the command-line parameters or uses obfuscation techniques to camouflage their activities. Assumptions also include the requirement that UltraVNC is installed in the environment, and that standard logging for process creation is enabled and properly configured.

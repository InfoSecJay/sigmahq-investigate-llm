title: Suspicious AddinUtil.EXE CommandLine Execution
id: 631b22a4-70f4-4e2f-9ea8-42f84d9df6d8
status: test
description: |
  Detects execution of the Add-In deployment cache updating utility (AddInutil.exe) with suspicious Addinroot or Pipelineroot paths. An adversary may execute AddinUtil.exe with uncommon Addinroot/Pipelineroot paths that point to the adversaries Addins.Store payload.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets the execution of `AddInUtil.exe`, a utility typically used for managing Microsoft Office add-ins. Adversaries may leverage this tool to manipulate add-in deployment caches, particularly using uncommon paths such as those within `AppData\Local\Temp`, `Desktop`, or other user-accessible directories that could hide malicious payloads. The rule monitors specific command-line arguments (`-AddInRoot` and `-PipelineRoot`) associated with `AddInUtil.exe`, which are often indicative of an attempt to redirect the utility's operations to locations controlled by the attacker. By filtering for `AddInRoot` and `PipelineRoot` values containing unusual or local paths, the rule aims to detect potentially malevolent usage patterns stemming from tactic T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution) within the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 
  To gather alerts, this rule primarily analyzes **process creation logs** from Windows, particularly focusing on the command-line arguments and the execution context of the `AddInUtil.exe` binary. This allows security analysts to correlate the runtime behavior of the process with documented suspicious indicators.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR for Process Execution:** Begin by querying your EDR for any instances of `AddInUtil.exe` executed with the flagged command-line arguments. Review the process metadata, including parent process information to identify how it was initiated.
    
  - **Review File Paths:** Investigate the paths provided in the command line to ensure they point to legitimate user locations. Cross-reference these paths with known safe patterns to confirm their legitimacy.
    
  - **Examine Related Network Activity:** Utilize your Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to check for any unusual network connections or data exfiltration attempts initiated during or after the process execution. Identify any communication with external domains that could indicate a payload delivery.
    
  - **Check for Multiple Instances:** Look for other processes running concurrently that may indicate chain execution or a broader campaign. This may involve checking for other suspicious executables or unusual scripts running around the same timestamp.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the utility's potential misuse for lateral movement and malicious activities. Given that `AddInUtil.exe` can be easily abused by adversaries, any instances of it running with suspicious parameters warrant immediate investigation to prevent further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that users may invoke `AddInUtil.exe` under legitimate conditions and may not flag all benign executions. Additionally, the detection may not trigger if the adversary renames the executable or uses other compliance with system policies for execution. Furthermore, if command-line arguments are obfuscated or differ significantly from expected patterns, the rule may fail to catch malicious activities. Understanding these aspects will help security engineers fine-tune detection capabilities and reduce false negatives.

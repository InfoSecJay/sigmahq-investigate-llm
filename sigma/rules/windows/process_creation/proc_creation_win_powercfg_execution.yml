  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activity involving the execution of `Powercfg.exe`, a legitimate Windows command-line utility historically used to manage power settings. The rule specifically looks for command line parameters that indicate an intent to change the lock screen timeout settings to unusual values, which could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence or evade detection by manipulating power settings. The relevant technical data sources for this rule include process creation logs which capture executable file information, original file names, and command line arguments, particularly those featuring `/setacvalueindex` and `-change -standby-timeout` switches. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** (T1203), as attackers may use legitimate tools in a deceptive manner to evade security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR tools to filter for instances of `Powercfg.exe` being executed, paying particular attention to the command-line arguments connected with changing lock screen timeout settings.
    
  - **Analyze User Activity**: Determine context around the user's behavior who executed the command, checking for anomalies in their activity patterns via historical logs in the Security and EDR systems.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs**: Use logs from Sysmon and Windows Event Viewer, especially focusing on security and application events, to identify if there was any preceding suspicious activity related to the user or system.
  - **Investigate Further Context**: Check network connections and data flows at the time of the event via NDR and proxy logs to see if there were any associated external communications to known malicious entities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a medium severity level as it detects behavior commonly used by adversaries to alter system configurations for persistence or obfuscation, especially in environments where such changes are not regularly performed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  False positives may occur if legitimate users execute `Powercfg.exe` for valid purposes within their administrative roles, especially in environments with frequent power management adjustments. Additionally, this rule may not fire in situations where attackers utilize alternative methods to change these settings or invoke `Powercfg.exe` in a different, less suspicious manner. Adversaries could also modify the command line arguments to evade detection using this rule. It is essential for analysts to understand that just because the rule does not trigger, it does not mean the activity was benign.

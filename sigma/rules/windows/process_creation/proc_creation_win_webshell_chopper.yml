  ### Technical Context
  The Chopper Webshell Process Pattern rule is designed to detect suspicious process executions related to the Chinese Chopper webshell, which is often delivered through vulnerabilities in web applications. This rule specifically monitors for the execution of the `w3wp.exe` process, which is the IIS (Internet Information Services) worker process, and looks for unusual command-line arguments that may indicate the presence of a webshell. The command-line patterns being analyzed can show potential malicious behavior often associated with webshell exploitation, such as command executions that gather system information or file manipulations. The primary data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, capturing both the image name of the process and its command-line parameters. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Persistence (T1050.003), Windows Remote Management (T1018), Lateral Movement (T1033), and Credential Dumping (T1087), highlighting the rule's relevance in tracking unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs for process creation events related to `w3wp.exe` to confirm if the process was initiated through legitimate channels or suspicious means.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Examine the command-line arguments of identified processes, specifically looking for the listed commands such as `ipconfig` or `whoami`, which could indicate webshell activity.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to correlate alerts for suspicious activity associated with the detected command patterns and determine if further investigation is needed.
  - **Investigate Network Connections:** Review network logs for unusual outbound connections initiated by `w3wp.exe`, as this could indicate data exfiltration or additional commands being executed over HTTP/S.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule are considered high severity due to the potential for serious enterprise-wide impacts tied to webshell access, which can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the attacker uses different process names or employs evasion techniques to hide their commands, such as modifying the command-line syntax or leveraging alternative methods of process creation. Additionally, this rule assumes that process creation logs are being captured and retained effectively, which may not always be the case if log retention policies are not properly configured or if logging mechanisms are disabled.

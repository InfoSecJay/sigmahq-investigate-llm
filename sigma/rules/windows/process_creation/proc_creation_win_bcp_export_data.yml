title: Data Export From MSSQL Table Via BCP.EXE
id: c615d676-f655-46b9-b913-78729021e5d7
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the execution of the BCP utility in order to export data from the database.
  Attackers were seen saving their malware to a database column or table and then later extracting it via "bcp.exe" into a file.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Data Export From MSSQL Table Via BCP.EXE" is designed to detect the execution of the Bulk Copy Program (BCP) utility in a Windows environment, specifically when it is used to export data from an MSSQL database. This rule operates by monitoring process creation events to identify instances where `bcp.exe` is executed with specific command-line parameters indicating data exporting actions, such as "out" or "queryout." These command-line patterns are used by both legitimate database administrators and potentially malicious actors, who may leverage BCP to extract sensitive data stored in a database, including malicious payloads or credentials. The relevant technical data sources include Windows security event logs capturing process creation and command-line execution details.
  This rule ties into the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic "Execution," specifically the technique T1048, which focuses on using the BCP utility for unauthorized data exfiltration or malware manipulation. By detecting this activity, incident responders can investigate potential data breaches or malicious activities aimed at compromising database integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify BCP Execution:** Check EDR logs for the execution of `bcp.exe` by correlating the alerts with timestamps, user account activity, and any associated process trees to understand if the execution was legitimate or suspicious.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line arguments used during the execution of `bcp.exe` to determine if the parameters align with known malicious usage patterns or if they appear consistent with legitimate database export activities.
  - **Check for Data Exfiltration:** Utilize network logs to analyze any connections made to external IP addresses post `bcp.exe` execution to identify potential data exfiltration attempts that might have occurred.
  - **Review User Activity:** Audit the user account involved in the execution of `bcp.exe` through applicable logging mechanisms to assess prior activities, potential account compromise, or anomalous behavior within the environment.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule is categorized as a medium severity alert since while the use of `bcp.exe` can often represent legitimate administrative tasks, its presence in security alerts requires careful examination to rule out malicious intents, particularly related to data breaches or unauthorized data extraction attempts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `bcp.exe` execution is commonplace and not adequately logged, leading to potential false negatives if there is an absence of auditing for necessary events. Additionally, the rule assumes that appropriate permissions and logging configurations are in place for process creation and command-line arguments. Adversaries may also use alternative methods for data extraction or employ obfuscation techniques to bypass detection, rendering this rule ineffective if their activities do not generate standard process logs.

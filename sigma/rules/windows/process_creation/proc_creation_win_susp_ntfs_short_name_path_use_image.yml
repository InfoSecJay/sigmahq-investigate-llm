  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects instances of the Windows 8.3 short filename format, a technique that adversaries may leverage to evade detection by security solutions. The rule specifically monitors process creation logs for instances where the file path contains the short name format denoted by a tilde (~) followed by a digit, which can indicate an attempt to disguise malicious executable files. The primary data sources used in this detection are process creation logs from Windows, focusing on key characteristics such as the image name and its parent process. The ability for users to create short file names can benefit attackers seeking to bypass security measures or mislead security analysts. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of "Defense Evasion" (TA0005) and specifically targets the technique of using short file paths to obfuscate malicious activities (T1564.004).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Tree:** Analyze the process tree in your EDR tool to examine the parent-child relationships for any suspicious processes that utilize short names. Pay particular attention to the specified parent images such as `Dism.exe` or `cleanmgr.exe`.
    
  - **Review Execution Paths:** Utilize the SIEM to investigate the execution paths of triggered alerts for the identified processes. Look for anomalies or unexpected paths that may indicate an evasion tactic.
  - **Validate Contextual Applications:** Investigate applications that may legitimately use short names (like `InstallShield`) to confirm they are not being misused. If legitimate applications are flagged, document any exceptions or consider tuning the rule.
  - **Perform DNS and Network Analysis:** Use NDR tools to review any outbound connections made by the flagged processes. Correlate these connections with known malicious IPs or domains to assess potential external commands or control.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated from this rule should be considered medium priority. The use of short names in process paths may indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity, warranting further investigation to ascertain the legitimacy of the flagged processes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where applications consistently utilize short file names as part of their normal operation, leading to potential false negatives. Additionally, there is an assumption that malicious actors prefer paths that can evade security detections; therefore, scripts or behaviors that do not conform to this rule may go unnoticed. Other engineers should be aware that sophisticated adversaries may code their executables to avoid using short names entirely, thus circumventing this detection capability.

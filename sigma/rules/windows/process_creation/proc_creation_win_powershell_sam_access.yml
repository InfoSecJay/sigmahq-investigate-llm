  ### Technical Context
  The **PowerShell SAM Copy** detection rule identifies potentially malicious attempts to access the Security Account Manager (SAM) hives on Windows systems through PowerShell commands. SAM hives are critical components of the Windows operating system that store sensitive user account information and passwords. This rule specifically looks for PowerShell command-line parameters containing references to the SAM hive located at `System32\config\sam`, along with commands commonly used for copying files (e.g., `Copy-Item`, `Copy`, etc.). 
  By monitoring process creation events in real-time, this rule taps into the power of **Windows Event Logs** and **Sysmon** logs. The detection aligns with the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework under the tactic of **Credential Access** and the technique **T1003.002**, which focuses on credential dumping from credential store hives like the SAM. If an alert is triggered, it could indicate an unauthorized actor attempting to extract sensitive user data.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Investigate the process creation logs in your EDR solution for any PowerShell processes that triggered the rule to identify the user context and timing of the actions taken.
    
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments**: Review the specific command-line arguments used with PowerShell; pay attention to any instances of `Copy-Item`, `cp`, or other copy commands that reference the SAM hive.
    
  - **Correlate with Other Logs**: Examine Windows Security and Sysmon logs for related events that could provide insights into user activity leading up to the alert, such as logins from unusual IP addresses or accounts.
    
  - **Identify False Positives**: Check against known backup or remediation scripts that may have invoked similar commands during legitimate operational processes; ensure none match the context of the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  An alert from this detection rule is considered high priority due to the sensitive nature of the SAM hives and the potential implications of unauthorized access to credential information, which could lead to significant breaches or lateral movements within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where PowerShell execution policies restrict command execution, or where attackers use other means (such as compiled binaries or alternative scripting methods) to access the SAM hives. Additionally, legitimate administrative or backup processes may inadvertently trigger false positives, which implies a reliance on script and user behavior for contextual understanding. It's vital for detection engineers to stay updated on recent techniques and adapt detections accordingly.

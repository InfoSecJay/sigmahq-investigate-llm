  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential unauthorized modifications to the Microsoft Defender Firewall settings using the `netsh` command-line utility. Adversaries may manipulate firewall configurations to enable specific traffic types, such as SMB and RDP, thereby bypassing security controls that limit network usage. The rule specifically looks for process creation logs indicating the execution of `netsh.exe`, specifically targeting command lines that contain parameters associated with enabling firewall rules. By analyzing these logs, SOC analysts can detect when a rule might have been altered inappropriately, indicating possible malicious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR to identify instances of `netsh.exe` execution, focusing on the time frame of the alert.
  - Analyze the command line parameters used with `netsh`, especially looking for keywords like 'advfirewall', 'set', 'rule', 'group=', 'new', and 'enable=Yes'.
  - Check the Windows Firewall logs for any recent changes to rule configurations that correspond with the identified `netsh` commands.
  - Consult with system administrators to verify if the detected activity was part of legitimate administrative actions or if further investigation is warranted.

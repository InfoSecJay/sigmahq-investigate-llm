  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the execution of the `netsh.exe` command-line utility, specifically targeting modifications to the Microsoft Defender Firewall rules via certain command-line arguments. Adversaries may utilize this tool to alter firewall settings, allowing unauthorized traffic such as SMB or RDP, thereby bypassing network security controls. The rule looks for process creation logs, primarily focusing on the execution of `netsh.exe`, and checks if the command line contains specific keywords like "advfirewall," "set," "rule," "group=", and "enable=Yes." By validating these command-line parameters, the rule helps identify potential defense-evasion tactics used by threat actors against an organizationâ€™s network security posture, corresponding with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.004).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the Windows Security logs for instances of `netsh.exe` execution and correlate with the timestamp of the alert to identify the origin of the command.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line parameters associated with the `netsh.exe` process to confirm whether firewall rules were modified, focusing on arguments that suggest unauthorized access (e.g., enabling new rules).
  - **Correlate Network Activities:** Use EDR tools to examine any subsequent network connections that may indicate unauthorized access or exploitation following the rule modification.
  - **Assess User Privileges:** Investigate the user account that executed the command by checking user access logs to determine if the activity was performed by an authorized administrator or a potentially compromised account.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for an adversary to exploit modified firewall settings, which could facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the command is executed in a stealthy manner, such as through scripts that obfuscate command-line parameters or using alternative tools to modify firewall settings. It assumes that `netsh.exe` is monitored adequately and that any legitimate administrative changes are appropriately authorized; thus, the rule may generate false positives in environments with frequent, valid firewall modifications.

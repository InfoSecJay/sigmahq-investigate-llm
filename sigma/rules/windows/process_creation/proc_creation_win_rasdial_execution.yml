  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious RASdial Activity" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity associated with the execution of `rasdial.exe`, a tool commonly used to establish dial-up network connections in Windows environments. The rule focuses on monitoring process creation events specifically for `rasdial.exe`, utilizing telemetry from Windows Security event logs (process creation) to identify when this executable runs. Adversaries may leverage legitimate tools like `rasdial.exe` to perform defense-evasion techniques and establish unauthorized remote access, making this a notable indicator of potential compromise. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of "Defense Evasion" and "Execution" as it addresses technique T1059, which pertains to command-line interface execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR to search for instances of `rasdial.exe` creation, noting the user context, parent process, and command-line arguments utilized during execution.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Check network logs for any activity related to `rasdial.exe` to identify whether it is attempting to connect to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  - **Inspect User Behavior:** Look for unusual user behavior associated with the execution of `rasdial.exe`, such as execution outside of normal hours or from uncommon machines.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Cross-reference with other alerts or log entries from Proxy, VPN, or NGFW that might indicate suspicious remote access or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level as `rasdial.exe` can be legitimately used in administrative tasks; however, its use in unusual contexts may indicate an attempt at unauthorized remote access or control, warranting further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `rasdial.exe` is executed from atypical locations that are not monitored or if it is embedded in scripts or automated tasks that make it harder to identify without context. It assumes that standard logging configurations are in place and that monitoring of processes is comprehensive. Additionally, skilled adversaries may disguise their activities by using different methods to establish remote connections, thereby evading detection by this specific rule.

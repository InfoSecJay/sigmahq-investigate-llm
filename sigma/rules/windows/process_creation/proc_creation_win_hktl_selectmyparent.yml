  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the execution of processes using the SelectMyParent tool, which enables Parent Process ID (PPID) spoofing. PPID spoofing is a technique used by attackers to hide the original source of a process by manipulating its parent process ID. This rule focuses on several key indicators, including the execution image (`SelectMyParent.exe`), specific command-line arguments that indicate PPID spoofing operations, and recognizable hashes associated with the tool. The rule analyzes Windows process creation logs, capturing data such as the image name and command line used during process instantiation. By correlating these parameters with known patterns of the SelectMyParent tool, the rule aims to identify potential misuse associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1134.004: Token Impersonation / PPID Spoofing**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze recent process creation events in your EDR solution for instances where `SelectMyParent.exe` was executed, paying attention to command-line parameters.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Check for any network connections established by the process using NDR tools to identify any malicious communication patterns that may accompany the spoofing toolâ€™s activity.
  - **Examine Related Processes:** Investigate the parent and child processes of any identified `SelectMyParent.exe` instances in the process tree, looking for any unusual or suspicious behaviors that might indicate further evasion tactics.
  - **Query SIEM for Historical Data:** Use your SIEM to review historical process creation events to detect any prior instances of parent PID spoofing attempts, noting any recurrence or patterns in usage.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for PPID spoofing to mask malicious activities, allowing adversaries to bypass detection mechanisms and operate under the guise of legitimate processes. When this rule is triggered, it indicates a likely attempt to conceal malicious activities within the environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the execution of the tool is obfuscated using alternative file names or if the parent process ID spoofing is achieved through other less detectable means. Additionally, the assumption is that the tool is executed in an environment where process creation logging is fully enabled; if logging is incomplete or disabled, the detection may fail. Adversaries may also employ more sophisticated techniques to evade detection, rendering this rule ineffective under certain advanced attack scenarios.

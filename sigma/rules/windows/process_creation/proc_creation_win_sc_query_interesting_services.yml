title: Interesting Service Enumeration Via Sc.EXE
id: e83e8899-c9b2-483b-b355-5decc942b959
status: test
description: |
  Detects the enumeration and query of interesting and in some cases sensitive services on the system via "sc.exe".
  Attackers often try to enumerate the services currently running on a system in order to find different attack vectors.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activity related to service enumeration on Windows systems via the `sc.exe` command-line utility. The rule identifies instances where `sc.exe` is being executed with specific command-line parameters, such as "query" and references to sensitive services like "termservice". The primary data source for this detection comes from Windows Event Logs, specifically the process creation logs, which capture critical information about newly created processes including the image name and command-line arguments. The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Credential Access" and the technique T1003, indicating potential attempts by adversaries to extract sensitive information from the system by enumerating various running services.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine Windows Event Logs for events related to the execution of `sc.exe`. Pay attention to the command-line parameters used, especially looking for "query" and any sensitive service names.
    
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize your EDR tool to determine if there are any additional suspicious activities associated with the `sc.exe` process. Check for any abnormal behaviors such as unusually rapid or repetitive executions.
  - **Analyze Service Configurations:** Investigate the configurations of the services being queried by reviewing their settings and parameters to check for any unauthorized changes or irregularities. This can provide insights into potential compromise.
  - **Check for User Context:** Identify the user context under which `sc.exe` was executed. Look for indicators of privilege escalation or unauthorized accounts that might have attempted to query sensitive services.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert pertains to enumeration attempts on potentially sensitive services, it should be treated with a medium to high severity level. Such behavior may indicate an initial reconnaissance phase by an adversary looking for attack vectors, thus requiring further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under certain conditions, such as if the command is executed with obfuscated or unexpected parameters outside the scope of the defined selections. Additionally, if there are baseline behaviors where legitimate administrative scripts access `sc.exe` for service monitoring, false negatives may result. It is assumed that affected systems are logging process creation events adequately. If logging is misconfigured or absent, crucial detections may also be missed, allowing adversaries to hide their activities more effectively.

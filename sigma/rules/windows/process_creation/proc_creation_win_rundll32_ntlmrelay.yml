  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious privilege escalation attempts involving the Printer Spooler service that leverage NTLM authentication. It identifies the use of `rundll32.exe`, a commonly used Windows utility for executing DLLs, specifically targeting command-line parameters that indicate an attempt to authenticate using NTLM through exploitation of the Printer Spooler service. The rule focuses on detecting command-line activities that include calling the DLL `davclnt.dll` with parameters that suggest a malicious intent to manipulate print services. 
  Primary data sources for detection include process creation logs, scrutinizing specific command-line arguments and the associated image name. Successful detection raises alerts for behaviors associated with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques of privilege escalation (T1212) and credential access, indicating a potentially severe threat to system integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check EDR solutions for `rundll32.exe` instances initiated within the past few hours, focusing on any that include the specified command-line arguments related to `davclnt.dll`.
  - **Analyze Networking Activity:** Use network detection tools to review any outgoing or incoming connections made by the Printer Spooler service during the time frame of the suspicious activity, particularly towards any unusual IP addresses.
  - **Check Security and Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Security logs for any related authentication attempts, especially those that may have leveraged NTLM and occurred in conjunction with the identified process creation events.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Look into user account logs to determine if the credentials linked to the suspicious activity were used legitimately elsewhere or if they show signs of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert should be treated as high severity due to the potential for privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive resources through NTLM coercion, which could lead to further compromise of the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Detecting these events relies heavily on proper capture of process creation logs; thus, environments with logging disabled or insufficiently granular logging may fail to generate alerts. Additionally, adversaries could potentially evade detection by renaming binaries or employing alternative methods of authentication. It's assumed that the logging configurations are adequately set up in line with the organization's security policies.

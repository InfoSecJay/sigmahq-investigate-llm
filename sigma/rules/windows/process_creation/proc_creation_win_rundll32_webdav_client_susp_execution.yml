title: Suspicious WebDav Client Execution Via Rundll32.EXE
id: 982e9f2d-1a85-4d5b-aea4-31f5e97c6555
status: test
description: |
  Detects "svchost.exe" spawning "rundll32.exe" with command arguments like C:\windows\system32\davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie. This could be an indicator of exfiltration or use of WebDav to launch code (hosted on WebDav Server) or potentially a sign of exploitation of CVE-2023-23397

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious execution patterns involving `rundll32.exe` being spawned by `svchost.exe`, specifically when the command line arguments indicate a WebDav operation. The rule looks for instances where the command line includes `C:\windows\system32\davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie`, which may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data or exploit vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2023-23397. The relevant data sources for this rule include process creation events from Windows security logs, which provide context on process hierarchies, command line usage, and parent processes. By focusing on suspicious usage of `rundll32.exe`, this rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of exfiltration (T1048.003) and can help to demonstrate potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in managed environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Tree:** Use an EDR tool to analyze the process tree leading to `rundll32.exe` executions, verifying if the legitimate application (`svchost.exe`) is indeed the parent process in the alert.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Inspect the detailed command line parameters for the flagged instance to assess if they reveal additional indicators or anomalies, such as unusual IP addresses or commands indicative of exfiltration.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Utilize network logs from your NGFW or NDR to trace outbound connections correlated with the suspicious process execution, particularly looking for any connections made to unusual or non-whitelisted IP addresses.
  - **Examine User Context:** Check the user context under which the process was initiated through Windows Event Logs to determine if the execution aligns with known user activity or if it appears anomalous.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is considered high because the use of `rundll32.exe` via `svchost.exe` in such contexts can signify malicious intent, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise, which poses a significant risk to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments where users frequently utilize WebDav functionality legitimately or if protections against this behavior (like application whitelisting) are in place. Additionally, if an adversary modifies their command execution methods (for instance, by using alternative legitimate processes), the detection could fail to trigger. The potential for false positives also exists if legitimate applications interact with the WebDav service for legitimate purposes that could mimic the described command-line pattern.

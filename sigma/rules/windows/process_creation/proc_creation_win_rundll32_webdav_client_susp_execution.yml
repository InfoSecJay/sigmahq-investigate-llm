title: Suspicious WebDav Client Execution Via Rundll32.EXE
id: 982e9f2d-1a85-4d5b-aea4-31f5e97c6555
status: test
description: |
  Detects "svchost.exe" spawning "rundll32.exe" with command arguments like C:\windows\system32\davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie. This could be an indicator of exfiltration or use of WebDav to launch code (hosted on WebDav Server) or potentially a sign of exploitation of CVE-2023-23397

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious activity involving `rundll32.exe` executed by `svchost.exe`, a common Windows system process. The rule specifically looks for scenarios where `rundll32.exe` is called with command-line arguments that indicate the loading of `davclnt.dll`, coupled with attempts to set device cookies via `DavSetCookie`. Such behavior is commonly associated with exfiltration tactics or exploitation of vulnerabilitiesâ€”specifically the CVE-2023-23397, which affects Microsoft Outlook. The rule utilizes process creation logs, focusing on the command-line parameters of the invoked processes to filter out legitimate local traffic and highlight suspicious external connections.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the alerts in the EDR console to identify the specific instance of `svchost.exe` invoking `rundll32.exe` and check for the full command-line arguments used.
  - Investigate the parent-child relationship in the process tree to understand the context of the execution, ensuring no legitimate applications were misidentified.
  - Analyze network connections logged by the NGFW or NDR for any unusual outbound traffic patterns that accompany the alert, focusing on external IP addresses.
  - Check cloud logs for any related activities or failed authentication attempts around the same timestamp, particularly on services that may have interacted with WebDav functionalities.

title: Greedy File Deletion Using Del
id: 204b17ae-4007-471b-917b-b917b315c5db
status: test
description: Detects execution of the "del" builtin command to remove files using
  greedy/wildcard expression. This is often used by malware to delete content of folders
  that perhaps contains the initial malware infection or to delete evidence.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Greedy File Deletion Using Del" is designed to identify the execution of the built-in Windows command `del` that uses wildcard expressions to remove files. This behavior is particularly associated with malicious activities, as adversaries may attempt to delete files that contain malware or its artifacts, thereby covering their tracks. The rule focuses on process creation events where the command line contains the `del` or `erase` command, alongside specific wildcard patterns to target various file types (e.g., `.dll`, `.exe`, `.js`). The primary data sources leveraged for this detection include Windows process creation logs and command-line parameters captured by Sysmon, which can track and log command execution activities on the system. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion," specifically the technique of "File Deletion" (T1070.004).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Inspect the Windows Security or Sysmon logs for instances of `cmd.exe` executing commands containing `del`, `erase`, or the specified wildcards to identify potential malicious activity.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters associated with the detected process to determine the targeted file paths and extensions, and assess if any critical system or application files were affected.
  - **Correlate with File System Activity:** Use EDR tools to correlate the identified process with file system changes, checking for deleted files in directories associated with initial malware infections or sensitive data.
  - **Examine Network Activity:** If possible, review network logs to check if the deletion event coincided with any unusual outbound connections to identify potential exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  When this alert is triggered, it should be treated with medium severity as it indicates a potentially malicious attempt to erase evidence or important system files. However, false positives can arise from benign administrative scripts or routine cleanup tasks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the deletion commands are executed in a way that does not match the specified criteria, such as through different command-line utilities or by using obfuscation techniques (e.g., encoding the command). Additionally, it assumes that process creation logs are being collected effectively and that the necessary Sysmon configuration for command-line logging is in place. Malicious actors may also delete files using other methods or commands that bypass Sysmon logging altogether.

title: Files Added To An Archive Using Rar.EXE
id: 6f3e2987-db24-4c78-a860-b4f4095a7095
status: test
description: Detects usage of "rar" to add files to an archive for potential compression.
  An adversary may compress data (e.g. sensitive documents) that is collected prior
  to exfiltration in order to make it portable and minimize the amount of data sent
  over the network.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the usage of the `rar.exe` application for adding files to an archive. It specifically looks for instances where the process command line contains the letter 'a', which indicates that files are being added to an archive. This behavior can be an indication of data compression by adversaries prior to exfiltration, particularly if they are attempting to stealthily gather and transfer sensitive documents. The rule leverages process creation logs from Windows, specifically monitoring the command line arguments and the process image, to enhance detection accuracy. The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics include **collection** under the technique **T1560.001**, which addresses the playbook of data compression in preparation for theft.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **EDR Investigation**: Use the EDR platform to search for process creation events related to `rar.exe`. Look for the associated user account and timeframes to determine if unauthorized file compression activities have occurred.
    
  - **Log Review**: Review Windows Event Logs for additional context surrounding the `rar.exe` execution. Pay special attention to security and system logs around the time of the process creation for associated activities or anomalies.
    
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Check for outbound network connections following the compression event. Use NDR and proxy logs to identify any suspicious data exfiltration attempts that may coincide with the timing of the `rar` usage.
    
  - **User Activity Audit**: Perform an audit of the user accounts that executed `rar.exe` to determine if they have legitimate reasons to compress files. Confirm whether these actions align with expected user behavior and authorized use of archiving tools.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as low severity because, while compressing files can indicate a preparatory step for data exfiltration, the `rar.exe` tool may be a legitimate application in many environments. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to ascertain the intent behind its use.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several recognized blind spots with this rule. First, if `rar.exe` is commonly used within the environment for legitimate purposes, this could generate numerous false positives, leading to alert fatigue. Additionally, if an attacker uses alternative compression tools or workarounds to bypass detection, the rule may not trigger. The assumption is made that typical command-line arguments for `rar.exe` will be present; if an adversary obscures their activities (e.g., by renaming the executable or obfuscating command arguments), the rule may fail to fire or be evaded.

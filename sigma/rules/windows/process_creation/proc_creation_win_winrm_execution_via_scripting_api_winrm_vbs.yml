  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Remote Code Execute via Winrm.vbs" aims to detect unauthorized attempts to execute code or create services on a remote host by leveraging the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) via a script called `winrm.vbs`. This rule identifies instances where `cscript.exe`, a Microsoft Windows script host, is used to invoke 'winrm' commands with specific parameters indicative of remote execution attempts. The rule focuses specifically on the command line associated with the `cscript.exe` process, looking for signatures that employ WinRM to manipulate remote systems through the WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). 
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the tactics of Defense Evasion and the technique T1216 (Script Proxy). Monitoring for process creation logs from `cscript.exe` combined with specific command-line parameters allows the SOC to quickly identify potential lateral movement or exploitation attempts within the enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs for instances involving `cscript.exe`. Cross-reference the time of the alert with other activities in the environment, looking for unusual patterns of use.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Investigate the command line parameters associated with the `cscript.exe` process instantiation. Confirm whether the usage of 'winrm' and the format of the command align with known legitimate use cases within your organization.
  - **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):** Utilize EDR to search for any known malicious IOCs that match the command lines or filenames implicated in the detection, including known hashes for `winrm.vbs`.
  - **Verify Network Connections:** Assess any potentially suspicious network connections or communications made by the detected process. Investigate external communications to confirm they align with expected usage patterns and protocols for your enterprise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to its potential implication of a lateral movement attempt by an adversary. Such actions may indicate an escalation of privileges, which could lead to further unauthorized access to critical systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - The rule may not fire if the `winrm.vbs` script is executed using other script hosts or methods aside from `cscript.exe`, such as `wscript.exe`, potentially allowing adversaries to bypass detection.
  - If script execution is legitimately utilized within the environment, the volume of benign alerts could lead to missed detection of true malicious events due to noise.
  - It is assumed that adequate logging is enabled on the systems to capture process creation events effectively; insufficient logging settings could prevent detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential malicious activities related to remote code execution using the `winrm.vbs` script via Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Specifically, it looks for instances where `cscript.exe` — a Windows script host used to execute scripts — calls the `winrm` command with specific parameters that indicate an intent to create a service on a remote host. The rule leverages process creation logs to monitor for `cscript.exe` executions, filtering them by checking both the process image name and the command line arguments that include keywords like `invoke` and `Create wmicimv2/Win32_`. Capturing these events helps in identifying lateral movement tactics and possible unauthorized attempts to execute code in different system contexts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review recent process creation logs from the EDR to identify instances of `cscript.exe` execution with the command line parameters outlined in the alert.
  - Correlate the identified `cscript.exe` activities with network logs to check for unusual outbound connections corresponding to the targeted remote hosts.
  - Analyze the command execution context to determine if the process was initiated from a user account with appropriate privileges or if there were any signs of credential theft.
  - Check firewall logs and any proxy traffic for suspicious access patterns that connect to remote management services during the timeframe of the alert.

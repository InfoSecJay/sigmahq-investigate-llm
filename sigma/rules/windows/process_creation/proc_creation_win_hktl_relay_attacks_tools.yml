  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of potentially malicious tools associated with SMB relay attacks on Windows systems. These tools, such as PetitPotam, RottenPotato, and JuicyPotato, are often used to escalate privileges by exploiting the SMB protocol vulnerabilities. The rule operates by monitoring process creations and analyzing specific properties such as the image names and command-line arguments of newly spawned processes. Analysts should focus on detecting particular keywords and patterns commonly used in the execution of these tools, which include various command-line parameters that indicate malicious usage of legitimate Windows functionalities. The related MITRE ATT&CK technique is T1557.001, which pertains to "Credential Dumping: NTLM Relay."
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Windows Security event logs for any process creations that match the designated names or command-line parameters indicative of SMB relay attack tools.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters associated with detected processes using EDR tools to identify if they contain unusual arguments that are characteristic of relay attack utilities.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Utilize NDR solutions to examine network traffic that may correlate with suspected relay attacks, focusing on SMB connections to verify legitimate user activity or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Correlate with User Activities:** Look into recent user activity within the organization through proxy and VPN logs to determine if the detected processes align with known user actions or indicate a potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this rule is classified as critical, its alerts should be prioritized for immediate investigation. The potential for privilege escalation via SMB relay attacks poses significant risk to the organization's security posture as it may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire for all incidents as it relies on specific identifiers linked to known tools. Adversaries could employ stealth techniques by renaming executables or utilizing custom scripts that do not include the specified patterns, leading to missed detections. Additionally, legitimate executions of these tools in specific contexts (such as authorized testing environments) may trigger false positives, requiring analysts to verify the context and intent behind the detected activity before escalating further.

  ### Technical Context
  The "WMIC Remote Command Execution" Sigma rule is designed to detect the use of the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool to execute commands on remote systems. WMIC can be a powerful utility for administrators, but it can also be exploited by attackers to gather system information, execute commands, and potentially escalate privileges on compromised machines. This rule focuses on identifying instances where WMIC is invoked with the `/node:` option, indicative of remote command execution. The telemetry monitored for this rule includes process creation logs, specifically looking at the execution of `WMIC.exe` and their associated command-line arguments. The detection is grounded in the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Execution** and technique **T1047**, which encompasses systems abused for command execution, particularly in remote scenarios.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Examine the EDR console for details related to any detected instances of `WMIC.exe`, focusing on the process tree to identify the parent process and any potential anomalies.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line arguments associated with the detected `WMIC.exe` execution to confirm whether the `/node:` parameter targets an unexpected or unauthorized remote host.
  - **Cross-Reference System Logs:** Check Windows Security and System logs for related events around the time of the WMIC execution, identifying any other activities that could indicate malicious intent, such as elevated privileges or lateral movement.
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Leverage NDR and network logs to observe if there were outbound connections to suspicious IP addresses correlating with the WMIC command execution time, as this could indicate data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is classified as medium due to the potential risk associated with unauthorized remote command executions, which could lead to further compromise if not investigated promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under certain circumstances, such as if the WMIC command is executed using different obfuscation techniques or if it employs alternative methods or tools that do not involve `WMIC.exe`. It assumes that the telemetry is adequately capturing all process creation events on monitored endpoints. Additionally, this detection does not account for known benign uses of WMIC within authorized environments, which may lead to false positives. Engineers should also be aware that sophisticated attackers might find ways to disable or bypass logging mechanisms or utilize WMIC within allowed parameters to escape detection.

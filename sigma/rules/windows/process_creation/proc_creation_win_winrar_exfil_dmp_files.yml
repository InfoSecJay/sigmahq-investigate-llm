  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of WinRAR, a popular file compression tool, specifically when it is used to compress dump files with extensions like ".dmp" and ".dump". The rationale behind this detection is that malicious actors may utilize WinRAR as part of their data exfiltration process by compressing sensitive data such as memory dump files before transferring them outside the network. The rule operates by monitoring process creation logs on Windows systems, looking for instances where WinRAR is executed with specific command-line arguments indicating the presence of dump file extensions. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Collection" and the technique "Data from Local System" (T1560.001), highlighting its relevance to identifying potential indicators of data theft or misuse.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check your EDR tool for any instance of WinRAR executing with a ".dmp" or ".dump" file in the command line. Investigate the user account that initiated the process for any suspicious activity.
  - **Examine System and Application Logs:** Use Windows Event Logs to validate the context of the WinRAR execution, particularly looking at the process creation log entries to gather more information about the environment and associated processes.
  - **Correlate with Proxy Logs:** If applicable, check proxy and network logs for any outbound traffic that aligns with the timing of the WinRAR process execution. Identify if any unusual file destinations or large data transfers are involved.
  - **Identify False Positives:** Investigate legitimate applications of WinRAR that may involve troubleshooting dump files, such as WER (Windows Error Reporting) processes, to rule out false positives.
  ### Prioritization
  As this alert involves the potential exfiltration of sensitive data through dump files, it carries a medium severity level. While there are legitimate use cases for compressing dump files, the context of the alert necessitates an investigation to ensure that no malicious activity is occurring.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where WinRAR is used without the specified command-line arguments or if an adversary employs different methods to compress files, such as using alternative file compression tools. Additionally, false positives may occur due to legitimate use cases, such as troubleshooting or application debugging. Analysts must be aware that encryption or obfuscation techniques could prevent detection if the command line does not explicitly reference the dump file extensions.

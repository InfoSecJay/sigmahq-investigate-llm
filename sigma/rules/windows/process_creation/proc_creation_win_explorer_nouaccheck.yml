  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Explorer NOUACCHECK Flag" is designed to detect instances where the Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) is initiated with the `/NOUACCHECK` command-line argument. This flag suppresses User Access Control (UAC) prompts for all processes spawned by the newly launched explorer.exe instance. The ability to bypass UAC checks can be exploited by adversaries to execute actions without administrative oversight, thus posing a significant security risk. The detection leverages Windows process creation logs, focusing on entries where explorer.exe is launched with the problematic argument. It falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of **Defense Evasion** and the technique **T1548.002**, which specifically addresses various methods of bypassing security mechanisms to execute malicious payloads without detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your SIEM to identify instances of explorer.exe launching with the `/NOUACCHECK` argument. Correlate these with the timestamps of other suspicious activities.
  - **Analyze Parent Processes:** Investigate the parent process associated with the alert. Use EDR tools to confirm whether the command-line initiated from svchost.exe is legitimate, as atypical parent-child process relationships can indicate potential exploitation.
  - **Check User Context:** Verify the user context under which the explorer.exe was executed. Ensure that the associated user account has a legitimate reason for executing this command, as unusual contexts can suggest malicious activity.
  - **Scan for Malicious Activities:** Utilize antivirus and endpoint detection tools to scan the affected host for any further signs of compromise, such as unexpected processes or modifications to critical system files.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered to have a high severity level due to the potential for significant security implications, as malicious actors could employ this method to avoid detection and execute harmful actions within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are recognized blind spots with this rule, including the possibility that legitimate software may occasionally use the `/NOUACCHECK` flag for legitimate purposes, resulting in false positives. Additionally, if an adversary executes a carefully crafted attack leveraging other methods or processes outside of explorer.exe, this rule may fail to trigger. It is also assumed that monitoring is adequately set up for process creation logs; any lack of logging can result in missed detections.

title: New Capture Session Launched Via DXCap.EXE
id: 60f16a96-db70-42eb-8f76-16763e333590
status: test
description: |
  Detects the execution of "DXCap.EXE" with the "-c" flag, which allows a user to launch any arbitrary binary or windows package through DXCap itself. This can be abused to potentially bypass application whitelisting.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on monitoring the execution of the application **DXCap.EXE** when it is launched with the **“-c”** command-line flag. The use of DXCap, a legitimate Windows binary, can be exploited by threat actors to run arbitrary binaries and potentially bypass application whitelisting mechanisms that are in place. The rule leverages process creation logs to identify instances where DXCap is executed with this specific command-line argument, aiming to provide alerts for potential misuse. This aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically **Defense Evasion (T1218)**, as adversaries often utilize legitimate tools and processes to evade detection.
  The primary data sources involved in this detection include Windows Event Logs related to process creation, particularly focusing on the attributes such as image name and command-line parameters. By monitoring these attributes, the detection rule can identify deviations from standard usage patterns and flag suspicious executions that could indicate malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze process creation events that include DXCap.EXE; filter the logs based on the presence of the command-line argument " -c ".
  - **Inspect Command Line Executions:** Check for additional command-line parameters passed alongside the “-c” flag that may indicate potential malicious behavior or intended targets for the execution.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity:** Validate the legitimacy of the user executing this command by correlating user login information from Windows Security logs to ensure the action is expected for their role.
  - **Evaluate Network Connections:** Use NDR tools to inspect any network activity initiated by the DXCap process, looking specifically for connections to unknown or suspicious destinations that could indicate further malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert for this rule is categorized as medium severity in an enterprise environment, as while the execution of DXCap.EXE with the "-c" flag may indicate potentially malicious activity, it can also occur in legitimate contexts. Thus, further investigation is warranted to determine intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are a few recognized limitations with this detection rule. First, legitimate use cases of DXCap.EXE may generate false positives when security teams respond to the alert. Moreover, if an adversary modifies the command-line parameters or uses alternative methods to execute similar malicious operations, the rule may fail to detect the incident. Additionally, users with high privileges may often utilize DXCap.exe legitimately, which can complicate the analysis of their actions.

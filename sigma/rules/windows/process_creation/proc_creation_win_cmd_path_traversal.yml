  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential CommandLine Path Traversal Via Cmd.EXE" detection rule aims to identify suspicious command-line activities that may indicate path traversal attempts using the Windows command line interpreter, cmd.exe. Path traversal can occur when an attacker exploits command/argument confusion, potentially leading to unauthorized access to files and directories. This rule looks for processes initiated by cmd.exe, specifically focusing on command-line parameters that indicate path traversal patterns, such as '/../../'. The relevant technical data sources include process creation logs, which provide details on the command lines used to launch processes, as well as the parent image and command line of the initiating process. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic Execution (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003 
  - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR system to verify the command-line arguments for the detected cmd.exe processes. Pay particular attention to the context of the execution, including user accounts and timestamps.
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Using Sysmon logs, inspect the parent image and command-line parameters that launched the cmd.exe instance. Look for any unusual or unexpected behaviors that could suggest malicious intent.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize your NDR solution to analyze network connections created by cmd.exe processes. Correlate this activity with command execution to identify any exfiltration attempts or callbacks to malicious IPs.
  - **Evaluate System Artifact Changes:** Examine relevant Windows System and Application logs for any files or settings modified by the cmd.exe process. Determine whether any unauthorized changes have been made that align with the detected alerts.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it indicates potential substantial risk due to misuse of command-line tools that could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches. Immediate investigation is warranted to assess the validity and potential impact.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not capture all instances of path traversal, especially if attackers employ methods to obfuscate commands or manipulate legitimate processes to their advantage. False positives can occur from benign Java library loading, as mentioned in the known false positive scenarios. Additionally, if an adversary bypasses cmd.exe or uses alternate scripting methods, this rule might fail to fire.

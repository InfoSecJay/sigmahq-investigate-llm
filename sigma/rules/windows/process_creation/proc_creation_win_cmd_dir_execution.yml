  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the usage of the "dir" command within the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe), specifically when the "/S" flag is employed. The "/S" flag allows users to enumerate files in a specified directory and all its sub-directories, which can be indicative of reconnaissance activities by an adversary looking to gather information about file structures and system contents. By analyzing process creation logs, particularly those that capture command line parameters, this rule checks for instances where cmd.exe is invoked with a command line string containing "dir -s". The MITRE ATT&CK framework tactic for this activity is "Discovery" and relates to the technique T1217, which outlines various ways attackers may explore and understand a target environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Use the EDR tool to review the process creation logs associated with the detected command. Look for additional anomalous activities or suspicious parent processes that can provide context on the command's execution.
  - **Examine User Context:** Investigate the user account that initiated the command. Check for any history of suspicious activity or unusual permissions associated with the user account.
  - **Review System Access Logs:** Analyze Windows Security Event Logs to ascertain if any changes in permissions or accesses were made during or after the command execution, which might suggest malicious intent.
  - **Cross-Reference with File Activity:** If applicable, query file access logs (using Sysmon or another monitoring tool) to identify any abnormal read/write activities to files in the specified directories after the command execution.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as low severity within an enterprise context because the command can be executed legitimately by users for administrative purposes. However, it warrants investigation due to its potential association with information gathering by unauthorized actors.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not activate if the command is executed via a different shell or scripting environment, or if the command parameters are obfuscated in a way that evades the detection mechanism. Additionally, if an attacker has the ability to spoof command-line arguments or use alternative utilities for file listing, the rule could be bypassed. It's also important to note that legitimate administrative tasks might generate similar alerts, leading to potential false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify unauthorized port forwarding activities for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) via the Netsh command-line utility in Windows environments. Specifically, it detects instances where `netsh.exe` is utilized to set up a port forwarding rule that targets port 3389, the default port for RDP. The detection works by analyzing process creation logs for specific command-line arguments that indicate an attempt to manipulate the RDP connectivity settings. Responders should be aware that legitimate administrative activities may use similar commands, so context is essential during investigations.
  The rule captures key indicators such as the execution of `netsh.exe` along with command-line parameters that include instructions for port forwarding to port 3389. This can point towards potential lateral movement or command-and-control operations by adversaries attempting to bypass network restrictions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Investigate the `process_creation` logs in your EDR to identify the source and context of the `netsh.exe` execution, noting the user account associated with the action.
  - Cross-reference relevant `CommandLine` arguments against your organization's policy to determine if there is legitimate approval for the use of port forwarding to port 3389.
  - Examine the network traffic logs from the NGFW or NDR to see if there have been any unusual RDP connection attempts initiated on the configured port, especially from external sources.
  - Review VPN and cloud platform logs (AWS, GCP, Azure) for any unauthorized access attempts that could indicate lateral movement or exploitation following the configuration of the port forwarding rule.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of `netsh.exe` to configure port forwarding for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) usage, specifically targeting UDP/TCP port 3389. By monitoring process creation events, the rule looks for instances of `netsh.exe` being executed with command-line arguments that indicate an intent to create an RDP forwarding rule. The detected command line must contain specific keywords and the port number (3389), which suggest potential lateral movement or illicit remote access activities. This behavior can align with tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Lateral Movement (T1021) and Command and Control (T1090) techniques, where attackers aim to bypass network restrictions and gain unauthorized access. Monitoring systems such as Windows Security and Sysmon assists in capturing the necessary telemetry information for effective detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR alerts:** Analyze the endpoint involved for any suspicious or unauthorized activities surrounding the time of the netsh execution. Look for unusual process trees or related network connections that could indicate an ongoing attack.
  - **Examine process creation logs:** Cross-reference the creation of `netsh.exe` with other security logs to identify any potentially malicious activity, such as unexpected logins or credential usage.
  - **Audit User Account Activities:** Check the user account that executed the command for previous anomalies or patterns of behavior that could signify compromise. Determine if legitimate personnel had the appropriate permissions.
  - **Inspect Network Logs:** Analyze firewall and VPN logs to check for any unusual incoming or outgoing traffic patterns that coincide with the detected event, particularly focusing on connections to port 3389.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been assigned a high severity level as the configuration of RDP port forwarding could imply an immediate risk of unauthorized remote access to critical systems, posing a significant threat to enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One of the primary blind spots in this detection rule is the potential for legitimate administration activities, where IT personnel may use `netsh.exe` for valid purposes. Additionally, if the adversary utilizes alternate methods or tools other than `netsh.exe` to accomplish the same goal, this rule may not trigger. There is also an assumption that proper security controls and monitoring systems are in place to log such activity effectively. Thus, organizations must remain vigilant for alternate methods of RDP tunneling not captured by this specific rule.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of CleanWipe, a tool typically used to remove Symantec antivirus software from endpoints. The rule focuses on specific executable names that are associated with the CleanWipe tool and looks for certain command-line parameters that indicate it is being used for uninstall purposes. The rule targets Windows process creation events and utilizes log sources such as Windows Security or Sysmon to gather data. The rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001), which involves evading security controls through the use of specialized tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Review the logs from Sysmon or Windows Event Logs for the identified processes (`SepRemovalToolNative_x64.exe`, `CATClean.exe`, `NetInstaller.exe`, `WFPUnins.exe`) and inspect their creation time, user context, and any suspicious parent processes.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** For the detected processes, closely examine the command-line arguments used during execution. Specific parameters such as `--uninstall`, `-r`, or flags indicating an enterprise uninstall can reveal intent and potential misuse.
    
  - **Cross-Reference with Known Bad Indicators:** Use EDR or threat intelligence platforms to check the identified binaries against known malicious signatures or behaviors associated with CleanWipe usage. This analysis can help determine if the alert is a false positive or indicative of malicious action.
  - **Review Historical Activity:** Investigate the context of the machine and user involved by reviewing the time window around the alert. Look for any anomalies such as unusual logins, changes to security settings, or previous alerts related to defense evasion tactics.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level of this alert is justified because the execution of CleanWipe can indicate potential malicious activity aimed at disabling endpoint security measures, posing a significant risk to the overall security postures of the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the CleanWipe tool is executed with different or obfuscated naming conventions, or if it's wrapped in other legitimate processes that mask its true intent. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions may also lead to false positives, necessitating careful investigation of such alerts. Furthermore, if the organization uses modified or proprietary versions of the CleanWipe tool, this detection rule may not capture those instances.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the `whoami.exe` command with the `/all` flag on Windows systems. By utilizing process creation logs, the rule identifies instances where the `whoami.exe` executable is run with specific command-line parameters, which typically outputs detailed information about user identities, group memberships, and security contexts. The key technical data sources involved include the process creation logs that contain details about the executable's image name and its command-line arguments. Notably, this behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Discovery**, specifically the technique **T1033 
  - System Owner/User Discovery**, as it pertains to gathering detailed information about the environment that could assist malicious actors in subsequent attacks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use your EDR tool to filter for `whoami.exe` executions within the timeframe of the alert, specifically looking for instances where the command line includes `/all`.
  - **Check For Malicious Behavior:** Investigate whether other processes were executed around the same time that could indicate suspicious behavior, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.
  - **Analyze User Context:** Determine the user account that executed the command and verify if it has legitimate privileges. Checking recent subject activity can provide additional context about potential abuse.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Look at logs from Windows Security, System, or Application logs to see if there are any related security events, such as failed login attempts or unusual account behaviors.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential cybersecurity risk associated with unauthorized users gaining insights about the system or network, which could lead to further malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in situations where `whoami.exe` is used legitimately by administrators or applications, or if process creation logging is disabled. Additionally, some malware may disguise its activities by using renamed copies of legitimate tools, which this rule would not detect. Assumptions also include that users are not regularly running `whoami.exe` with the `/all` flag for legitimate purposes. Such situations should be further assessed by considering the context of user behavior and system configurations.

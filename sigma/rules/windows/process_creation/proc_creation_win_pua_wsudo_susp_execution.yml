  ### Technical Context:
  The **PUA 
  - Wsudo Suspicious Execution** rule is designed to detect the use of the Windows Sudo Utility (wsudo), a tool that enables users to execute programs with elevated permissions such as System, Trusted Installer, or Administrator. This rule analyzes process creation logs specifically for instances of wsudo being launched, while also examining the command-line arguments used during its execution. The detection focuses on specific parameters known to be associated with privilege escalation, such as `-u System` and `-u TrustedInstaller`. By correlating this evidence with parent process information, the rule identifies potentially malicious behavior that aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, particularly those associated with privilege escalation (T1059).
  The primary data sources leveraged by this detection include **Windows Sysmon with process creation** events. These events provide insights into the newly created processes, command-line arguments, and their parent processes, which are crucial for establishing the context of the operation. Monitoring these logs helps to surface any unauthorized usage of wsudo that could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges maliciously.
  ### Investigation Steps:
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to search for instances of wsudo.exe being executed, paying close attention to the command-line arguments utilized.
  - **Check Parent Process Relationships**: Investigate the parent process (wsudo-bridge.exe) of any detected wsudo instances to assess whether they originated from expected or suspicious sources.
  - **Gather Additional Context from Sysmon**: Review Sysmon logs for any additional indicators of compromise related to the wsudo execution, including image loads or network connections that may indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - **Monitor for User Behavior**: Utilize Windows Security logs to track user account activities around the time wsudo executions were recorded, focusing on any unusual access patterns or privilege escalation attempts.
  ### Prioritization:
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential implications of privilege escalation associated with wsudo's use. Unauthorized escalation can lead to extensive system compromise, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access to critical resources.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions:
  The detection may not trigger for legitimate administrative usage of wsudo if it is used in compliance with organizational policies. Furthermore, if an adversary modifies the wsudo executable or uses command-line arguments not specified in the rule, detection may fail. It is also important to note that various versions or custom implementations of wsudo could bypass this detection, necessitating ongoing adjustments to detection parameters and ongoing monitoring for new patterns of misuse.

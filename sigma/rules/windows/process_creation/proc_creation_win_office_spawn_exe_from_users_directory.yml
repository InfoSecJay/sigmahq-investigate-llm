  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious executable files created in a user's directory that have been initiated from Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Visio, and Access. The primary objective is to identify potentially malicious activity where a user inadvertently runs an executable file that could be harmful, following their use of a trusted application. The rule analyzes process creation logs to capture any instance of an executable file located in the `C:\users\` directory that is spawned by these specific Office applications. It filters out instances where the executable is Microsoft Teams to reduce false positives. The detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique `T1204.002 
  - Malicious File`, which encompasses the execution of malicious code through user interactions with trusted applications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs to identify instances of executables initiated from Office applications, focusing specifically on the command-line parameters and parent process details.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize the endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to check for related alerts or indicators that might suggest malicious behavior associated with the detected executable.
  - **Analyze File Reputation:** Use VirusTotal or similar services to assess the reputation of the identified executable for any known malicious activity or behaviors.
  - **Review User Activity:** Investigate the userâ€™s activity leading up to the occurrence of the executable, including recent file downloads, email attachments, or any other interactions that may have triggered the execution.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for malware delivery through seemingly legitimate applications, this alert is classified as high severity. Quick investigation and response are critical to mitigate any potential damage from a malicious executable being run on a user system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where the malicious executable is located outside the user directory or is executed via methods not captured by process creation logs. Additionally, if users are operating under atypical permissions or if Office applications exhibit abnormal behaviors such as enhanced privileges, the rule may fail to catch certain threats. False negatives may also arise if attackers employ tactics to obfuscate their methods or if the malicious executable does not conform to the specific naming patterns or paths defined in the detection criteria.

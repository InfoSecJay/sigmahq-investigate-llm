  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential reconnaissance activities conducted through the execution of the built-in Windows script `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs`, which gathers information about the target machine's network configuration and connected devices. The rule monitors for the execution of Windows script hosts, specifically `cscript.exe` and `wscript.exe`, that are used to run this Visual Basic script. Detection utilizes process creation logs, specifically focusing on command-line arguments that contain "gatherNetworkInfo.vbs." This behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Discovery (T1615) and Execution (T1059.005), indicating that the script is commonly used by adversaries to collect valuable information from a compromised environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in the SIEM, focusing on instances where `cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe` was executed with the `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs` argument to assess the context of the activity.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR to search for any unusual behavior associated with the detecting process, such as subsequent network connections or abnormal process tree initiations that suggest lateral movement or additional malicious activities.
  - **Check for Other Indicators:** Investigate related events, such as file creations or modifications in paths typically associated with scripts or malware, which can indicate an attempt to manipulate or trojanize legitimate scripts.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Analyze user accounts associated with the execution to determine if the action aligns with normal administrative tasks or if it appears suspicious in the context of user behavior analytics.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the nature of the `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs` script, which can be useful for reconnaissance by attackers. However, it could also be executed legitimately for administrative purposes, necessitating further investigation to discern intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the script is executed using alternative methods, such as from an unauthorized PowerShell or through another script invoking a different method. Additionally, benign administrative activities that utilize the script are potential false positives, and if an adversary utilizes custom scripts or obfuscation techniques to call `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs`, this detection may fail. It is essential to ensure adequate context around user activities to distinguish between legitimate administrative tasks and potential malicious behavior.

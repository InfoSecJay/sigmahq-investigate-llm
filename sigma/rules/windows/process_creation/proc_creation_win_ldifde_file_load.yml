  Detects the execution of "Ldifde.exe" with the import flag "-i". The can be abused to include HTTP-based arguments which will allow the arbitrary download of files from a remote server.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is focused on detecting the execution of `ldifde.exe`, a tool typically used in Windows environments for importing and exporting directory services data. Specifically, it looks for instances where `ldifde.exe` is run with the import flag `-i` and includes a file specification flag `-f`. This can potentially be misused by attackers to download arbitrary files from remote servers via HTTP-based arguments in conjunction with the import command, a technique that can lead to data exfiltration or the execution of malicious payloads. The rule leverages data from process creation logs to identify suspicious command-line executions tied to `ldifde.exe`, ensuring that both the executable name and specific command-line arguments match defined criteria.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR to verify the execution of `ldifde.exe` and examine the command-line arguments used in the invocation. 
  - Check for any associated network activity in the NDR that might indicate outbound connections to suspicious or unauthorized IP addresses during the time of the `ldifde.exe` execution.
  - Analyze the Proxy logs for any HTTP requests or downloads triggered by the command, particularly focusing on external sites that could host malicious files.
  - Search through event logs in your SIEM for any related security events or anomalies that coincide with the suspected `ldifde.exe` commands to uncover potential additional indicators of compromise.

  Detects the execution of "Ldifde.exe" with the import flag "-i". The can be abused to include HTTP-based arguments which will allow the arbitrary download of files from a remote server.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the execution of the "Ldifde.exe" utility with the import flag "-i" in its command-line arguments. Ldifde.exe is a Windows command-line tool that provides the ability to import and export data in the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF). The primary concern is that attackers can exploit this tool to import data potentially containing HTTP-based arguments, which could facilitate the arbitrary downloading of files from malicious servers. The detection leverages Windows process creation logs, specifically focusing on the process image and command-line parameters, to identify the misuse of this utility. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for Command and Control (T1071) and Defense Evasion (T1218).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the relevant process creation logs in your EDR tool to confirm the execution of "ldifde.exe" with the improper arguments. Look for associated parent processes that may indicate the context of execution.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Assess network connection logs for any outgoing connections that occur alongside the execution of Ldifde.exe. Specifically, look for connections initiated to unknown or suspicious domains, which could indicate command-and-control activity.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Validate the complete command-line arguments used during the execution. Be vigilant for any suspicious file paths or remote URLs included in the command.
  - **Correlate with Endpoint Activity:** Inspect other logs (such as AV and Proxy) for any related security events or alerts that correlate with the execution of Ldifde.exe, as this may provide additional context for potential malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential exploitation of Ldifde.exe for downloading malicious files, which could lead to further compromise within the enterprise environment. However, false positives may still occur depending on the legitimate use of the tool.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the relevant command-line parameters and associated process behaviors are logged effectively. It may not fire if Ldifde.exe is executed in a non-standard manner, or if logging is disabled on endpoints. Additionally, legitimate administrative use of Ldifde.exe could lead to false positives, especially if the imported data is valid and benign. Attackers might bypass detection by using pseudo-random command-line parameters or invoking Ldifde.exe from a different context that circumvents logging.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Sdclt Child Processes" is designed to detect instances where the Microsoft component **sdclt.exe**, related to the Windows System Data Collection Tool, spawns new processes. The creation of child processes by sdclt.exe may suggest an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) protections, as it can be exploited by threat actors to escalate privileges or to execute unauthorized commands with higher privileges. This monitoring leverages **process creation logs** to track which processes are initiated by sdclt.exe. When an unusual or unexpected child process is detected originating from sdclt.exe, it raises an alert for investigation.
  This detection aligns with the **MITRE ATT&CK tactic** of Privilege Escalation, particularly under the technique **T1548.002**. It is critical to monitor such activities, as they can serve as signs of a potentially compromised system or unauthorized activity aimed at increasing access privileges.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs for additional context regarding the parent process (sdclt.exe) and any child processes spawned. Pay special attention to the command line arguments used.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to gain insights into the behavior of the processes involved in the alert, ensuring to analyze any suspicious activity associated with these processes.
  - **Check for UAC Bypass Techniques:** Investigate whether other processes have executed alongside sdclt.exe that may indicate an attempted UAC bypass, using tools or logs that document administrative actions.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Assess network activity through NDR solutions to ascertain if any suspicious or unauthorized external communications occurred post-process creation.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as medium, as the spawning of child processes from sdclt.exe is not typically associated with benign operations and may indicate a shift in privilege or unauthorized actions that warrant further scrutiny.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if sdclt.exe is not present in the environment, or if child processes invoked by sdclt.exe do not exhibit typical attributes that signify malicious activity. Additionally, defenders should be aware that advanced adversaries could invoke sdclt.exe through legitimate processes, potentially evading detection. It's also assumed that all necessary process creation logs are being collected and adequately retained for analysis. Hence, proper retention and monitoring policies should be in place to ensure all relevant telemetry is accessible for investigation.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for "Suspicious Runscripthelper.exe" aims to identify potentially malicious activity involving the execution of PowerShell scripts via the `Runscripthelper.exe` executable. This executable, which is part of the Windows operating environment, can be exploited by adversaries to execute scripts in ways that bypass standard security measures. The rule specifically looks for instances where the `CommandLine` parameters contain the term `surfacecheck`, combined with the `Image` field indicating that the process running is `Runscripthelper.exe`. The use of specific command line arguments can denote attempts by adversaries to execute malicious scripts and may fit within the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for execution (T1059) and defense evasion (T1202). Monitoring sources such as Windows Sysmon for process creation logs is critical for detecting these executions effectively.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Investigate the process details in the EDR for `Runscripthelper.exe` to confirm its origin and context of execution, such as parent process relationships.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the full command line arguments associated with the alert, paying special attention to other parameters that may be indicative of malicious intent beyond just ‘surfacecheck’.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference with PowerShell logs and system event logs for additional suspicious activities that occurred around the same time, such as unusual PowerShell commands or other evasion techniques.
  - **Investigate Network Activity:** Evaluate any related network connections logged by the EDR, NGFW, or NDR solutions to determine if there was suspicious outbound traffic coinciding with the execution of `Runscripthelper.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential of `Runscripthelper.exe` execution to facilitate script-based attacks, which can be precursors to further compromise. Immediate investigation is warranted to assess potential security breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the executable name is altered or if the command line does not contain the specific term 'surfacecheck', leading to missed detections of obfuscated or slightly modified attack vectors. Additionally, if the `Runscripthelper.exe` is executed legitimately with standard commands, it may generate false negatives. Analysts should assume that adversaries could leverage other similar methods or binaries not covered by this rule, making comprehensive monitoring essential for holistic security.

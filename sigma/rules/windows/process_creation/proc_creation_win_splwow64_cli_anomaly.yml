  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious Splwow64 Without Params" is designed to detect instances where the `splwow64.exe` process is initiated without any command-line parameters. This process, part of the Windows system, is responsible for managing 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems. By monitoring the process creation events for `splwow64.exe` without parameters, the rule aims to identify potential misuse of this process, often associated with evading detection by running malicious payloads that might exploit this valid system function. The rule makes use of Windows process creation logs, specifically looking for instances where the `Image` path ends with `\splwow64.exe` and whether the `CommandLine` parameter also concludes with the executable name without any additional arguments. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion and the technique T1202.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Details:** Use EDR to drill down into the detected `splwow64.exe` instance, checking for parent process, user context, and creation timestamp to establish legitimacy.
  - **Examine Command Line Parameters:** Review other instances of `splwow64.exe` to compare command-line parameters. A lack of parameters is unusual and warrants further scrutiny.
  - **Check for Related Activity:** Look in Windows Security and System logs for related activities such as suspicious process creations or any anomalous device usage that coincided with the detected instance.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Utilize NDR and firewall logs to determine if the affected host initiated any unusual network connections around the same time as the suspicious process creation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is prioritized as high severity due to the nature of `splwow64.exe` being invoked without parameters, which is atypical and suggests potential exploitation attempts. Rapid response may be necessary to mitigate threats leveraging this technique.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not detect all malicious use of `splwow64.exe` if the command-line invocation is executed with arguments that appear legitimate but are actually harmful. Additionally, the rule relies solely on process creation logs; if an adversary employs methods to create the process without invoking it in traditional ways, it may not fire. It's assumed that all relevant telemetry sources are properly monitored and that `splwow64.exe` is not being used legitimately by various applications within the environment.

title: Potential Mpclient.DLL Sideloading Via OfflineScannerShell.EXE Execution
id: 02b18447-ea83-4b1b-8805-714a8a34546a
status: test
description: |
  Detects execution of Windows Defender "OfflineScannerShell.exe" from its non standard directory.
  The "OfflineScannerShell.exe" binary is vulnerable to DLL side loading and will load any DLL named "mpclient.dll" from the current working directory.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule identifies potential misuse of the Windows Defender component "OfflineScannerShell.exe" when executed from a non-standard directory. Specifically, this rule looks for instances of the process "OfflineScannerShell.exe," monitoring its original file name and the current directory it is being run from. By design, the legitimate path for this executable is 'C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\Offline\', but malicious actors may exploit this executable by invoking it from other locations. This executable can be manipulated to load a malicious DLL named "mpclient.dll" from the current working directory if it is not run from its legitimate path, making this detection critical for preventing DLL sideloading attacks. This behavior correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), which focuses on the evasion of security mechanisms by executing trusted binaries inappropriately.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Check the execution path of "OfflineScannerShell.exe" using EDR to confirm if it was launched from an unauthorized location, indicating a potential sideloading attempt.
  - **Inspect Current Directory:** Use Windows Event Logs (Sysmon) to inspect the current working directory of the process to see if it contains the suspicious 'mpclient.dll' or any other unexpected DLL files.
  - **Analyze Related Network Activity:** Review logs from your network security tools to look for any unusual outbound connections initiated by "OfflineScannerShell.exe," which could indicate an attempt at exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
  - **Check for DLL Files:** Search the filesystem for any instances of "mpclient.dll" within non-standard directories, and verify the hashes of these files against known good or malicious indicators.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as medium due to the potential for exploited vulnerabilities and evasion techniques employed by attackers, which could lead to further compromise within an enterprise environment, especially if unauthorized binaries are executed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where "OfflineScannerShell.exe" is legitimately used from unexpected directories or when system policy allows such configurations. Additionally, if malicious actors employ obfuscation techniques or load a different DLL, the detection may not trigger as designed. Response teams should also consider user behavior and administrative configurations that may be misinterpreted as threats.

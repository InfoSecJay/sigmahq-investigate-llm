  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of `explorer.exe` initiated by a command-line interface such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `pwsh.exe`, specifically for the purpose of opening the "My Computer" folder via the command `shell:mycomputerfolder`. By analyzing the `process_creation` logs, the detection mechanism looks for instances where the parent process is a command line interface and the child process is `explorer.exe`, triggered with the specified command line containing the formatted path.
  The underlying purpose of this detection is to identify potentially anomalous or unauthorized use of file exploration, which can suggest an evasion tactic utilized by an adversary to assess the systemâ€™s file structure or to facilitate further malicious activity. This correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1135: "Network Share Discovery", as the use of shortcuts can be leveraged for navigating through network resources directly through the file explorer interface.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Details:** Use your EDR solution to inspect the details of the detected `explorer.exe` process, focusing on its parent processes and any related command-line arguments that initiated its execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Look at the command-line history in the process creation logs to confirm whether the observed command includes `shell:mycomputerfolder` and assess the context of its execution to identify any anomalies.
  - **Cross-reference with Security Logs:** Check for any prior security events that may correlate with the execution of these processes, especially security logs from Windows Event Viewer that could provide insights into user activity before the alert was triggered.
  - **Monitor Impacted System Activity:** Review network connections and recently accessed files on the system related to the detection to determine if there was any suspicious activity post-execution that might indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of "high" for this alert is due to the nature of the process initiation, which could signal an unauthorized user attempting to access files or directories on the local or networked systems, warranting immediate investigation to rule out malicious activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot for this rule is the reliance on the specific command `shell:mycomputerfolder`, which could be modified or bypassed if an adversary uses different arguments or execution methods to open directories. Additionally, if legitimate users frequently access system folders through these command-line methods, it may lead to false positives. Analysts should consider the context of the environment and typical user behavior when investigating alerts to avoid misinterpretation and to understand how the rule may fail to fire in cases where commands are obfuscated or executed in unconventional ways.

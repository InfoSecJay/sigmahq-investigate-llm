  ### Technical Context
  The QuickAssist Execution Sigma rule detects the execution of the Microsoft Quick Assist tool, specifically the process `QuickAssist.exe`. This tool is intended for remote assistance but has been noted for its potential misuse by threat actors to gain unauthorized remote access to systems. The rule primarily leverages Windows process creation logs to identify instances where this executable is run, capturing relevant data such as process image paths and timestamps. By monitoring for this specific process, the detection aims to identify potential command and control activity consistent with adversarial tactics. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219 (Remote Access Tools), where attackers leverage tools such as Quick Assist to establish remote connections.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Recent Activity:** Review the process creation logs in the EDR for additional context around the timing of Quick Assist executions, including user accounts involved and any unusual activity leading up to its execution.
  - **Verify User Justification:** Determine if the user account launching `QuickAssist.exe` has legitimate reasons for its usage. Investigate any recent remote support requests or internal processes that may explain the activity.
  - **Search for Associated Network Connections:** Use your network detection tools to monitor for any outbound or unexpected connections that coincide with the execution of Quick Assist, which may indicate unauthorized communication with external malicious endpoints.
  - **Review Proxy and VPN Logs:** Investigate logs from proxies and VPN services to check for external connections initiated from the host after Quick Assist was launched, ensuring that there was no inappropriate access to corporate resources.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for alerts generated by this rule is considered low; however, the indication of `QuickAssist.exe` being executed should prompt a review to confirm whether the usage was legitimate or indicative of a potential security incident, as it may lead to unauthorized remote access scenarios.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule operates under the assumption that `QuickAssist.exe` is not frequently used in the environment. If the tool is used regularly by helpdesk personnel, legitimate executions may be flagged as false positives. Additionally, attackers could potentially rename or mask the execution of the Quick Assist tool, which would allow them to bypass detection. Also, if the tool is launched through means that do not generate standard process creation logs, such as a scheduled task or a script, the rule may not trigger.

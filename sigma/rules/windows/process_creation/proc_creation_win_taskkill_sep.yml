description: |
  Detects one of the possible scenarios for disabling Symantec Endpoint Protection.
  Symantec Endpoint Protection antivirus software services incorrectly implement the protected service mechanism.
  As a result, the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM user can execute the taskkill /im command several times ccSvcHst.exe /f, thereby killing the process belonging to the service, and thus shutting down the service.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect instances where the `taskkill` command is used to forcibly terminate the `ccSvcHst.exe` process associated with Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP). The unique aspect of this detection lies in the execution of the command with specific parameters, namely `/F` (force) and `/IM` (image name), indicating that the user is attempting to terminate the SEP service. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs, which capture command-line activity, to identify this potential evasion of security measures. Monitoring these command invocations can help organizations recognize attempts to disable critical security services.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools), which highlights methods used by adversaries to circumvent defenses by tampering with security services.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs in your SIEM or EDR solution for any occurrences of the `taskkill` command being executed, specifically with the parameters that indicate a focus on `ccSvcHst.exe`.
    
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check which user or service account executed the command to determine if it was initiated by a legitimate user or if it may indicate suspicious activity from an unauthorized source.
  - **Examine System Events:** Check Windows Security and System logs for any events that may indicate changes to security policies or service states around the time the `taskkill` command was executed.
  - **Review AV/EDR Response:** Determine if your antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools processed any alerts or warnings related to this command execution, which may provide context on whether the action was part of an adverse event.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because the forced termination of a security service like Symantec Endpoint Protection could indicate a significant risk to the organization's cybersecurity posture, potentially allowing for malware installation or other malicious activities to occur undetected.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the command is executed without the expected parameters or if the process name is altered by an attacker. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions that may involve stopping or restarting the SEP service could lead to false positives. The effectiveness of this detection is based on the correct logging of command-line activity by the operating system. There might also be environments where taskkill-like commands are used in ways that do not fit the detection criteria, allowing adversaries to evade detection.

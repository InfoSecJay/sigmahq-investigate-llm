  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Add New Download Source To Winget" is designed to detect the use of the command-line tool `winget.exe` for adding additional download sources on Windows systems. Specifically, the rule monitors process creation events, particularly those related to `winget.exe`, and looks for specific command-line parameters that indicate the addition of a source (i.e., containing both 'source' and 'add'). This is relevant as such actions could facilitate the installation of potentially malicious software if an unauthorized source is added, making it critical for detecting boundary breaches and malicious activities associated with Software Supply Chain Attacks. 
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1203) and "Execution" (T1059), highlighting the need for vigilance against user actions that could alter trusted software sources and introduce vulnerabilities into the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR Tool for Process Creation Events:**
    Run a search in the EDR solution for recent `winget.exe` executions, specifically examining the command-line arguments to confirm whether they include 'source' and 'add'.
  - **Inspect Command-Line for Unusual Sources:**
    Review the command-line parameters associated with the `winget.exe` process to identify any unauthorized or suspicious download sources that have been added.
  - **Check for User Context:**
    Investigate the user account that initiated the `winget` command. Confirm whether the user is authorized to modify download sources or if their actions warrant further scrutiny.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:**
    Look at network logs to see if any connections were established to the new sources immediately after they were added, as this could indicate malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level as it identifies a potentially authorized action that could lead to significant security implications if performed maliciously. Quick action is recommended to assess the legitimacy of the user's intent, ensuring enterprise software management integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that all legitimate users and administrators have a valid reason to add new download sources. False positives may occur in environments where users regularly manage development tools and repositories. Furthermore, if an adversary claims legitimate user credentials or if users are unaware of the risks, this detection might not trigger. Engineers should be aware that users with malicious intent could also invoke `winget.exe` through alternate methods or obfuscate command-line inputs to evade detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the usage of web request commands and cmdlets via PowerShell and other command-line tools on Windows systems. Specifically, it looks for command-line inputs that include PowerShell cmdlets and aliases such as `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Invoke-RestMethod`, and common download commands like `curl`, `wget`, and BITS transfer commands. These commands are often used to interact with web resources, potentially facilitating malicious activities like data exfiltration, command and control callbacks, or downloading additional payloads. The rule primarily relies on logs from process creation events, where detailed information about the executed commands and their parameters can be extracted. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.001, which pertains to executing commands through PowerShell.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Use the EDR tool to review process creation logs for instances where the specified commands or cmdlets are detected. Focus on the timing and the parent process of these command executions.
  - **Review Command Context:** Investigate the context of the commands by analyzing command-line arguments and associated user accounts to determine if they align with normal behavior for users or services.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize NDR to monitor outgoing and incoming network connections that coincide with the detected command executions, checking for suspicious URLs or unusual destinations.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators:** Look into correlated logs such as security events, AV detections, and any related cloud activity that might provide context about the intent behind the web request commands.
  ### Prioritization
  The detection rule is assigned a medium severity level because while the use of web request commands can be legitimate, they can also indicate potential malicious intent. Investigations are warranted to rule out the risk of data exfiltration or the execution of unauthorized scripts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if users leverage less common or obscured command aliases that do not match the specified patterns. It also assumes that PowerShell logging is adequately configured to capture detailed command information. Additionally, legitimate administrative usage of commands like `Invoke-WebRequest` for policy or maintenance tasks may lead to false positives. Adversaries may also use techniques to obfuscate their command efforts, bypassing detection.

description: Detects execution of "odbcconf" with the "REGSVR" action where the DLL
  in question doesn't contain a ".dll" extension. Which is often used as a method
  to evade defenses.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potentially Suspicious DLL Registered Via Odbcconf.EXE" is designed to detect instances where the executable `odbcconf.exe` is used for registering a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that does not conform to conventional naming conventions (i.e., it lacks a ".dll" extension). This behavior often indicates an attempt to bypass security mechanisms, as legitimate DLLs typically have the ".dll" suffix. The rule operates by monitoring the process creation events sourced from Windows, specifically looking for command-line arguments that reference the `REGSVR` action—indicative of a DLL registration command—while explicitly filtering for those commands that do not contain a valid DLL extension. Such actions fall under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the technique T1218.008 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution). Relevant telemetry sources for this rule include process creation logs, which provide insights into command-line activity, and details concerning the executing image.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the execution details of `odbcconf.exe` in your EDR tool to understand its running context. Look for information such as user permissions and parent processes related to this activity.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Inspect the command line used during the process creation to identify the specific invocation of the `REGSVR` action. Validate whether the targeted DLL lacks the ".dll" extension as indicated by the alert.
  - **Review Related Events:** Cross-reference other logs, including Sysmon logs of process access or network connections, to detect any suspicious activity linked to the execution of `odbcconf.exe`. Look for any subsequent process invocations or unusual network communications.
  - **Correlate with Security Tools:** Use your AV and threat intelligence tools to assess whether the identified DLL or any associated processes have been flagged as malicious. Pay particular attention to any alerts raised in relation to defense evasion techniques.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the sophisticated nature of the evasion technique being employed. Detection of such activity typically signals attempts to compromise system integrity, and actionable response is critical to mitigate potential threats effectively.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the command line is obfuscated or manipulated to bypass detection by adding misleading parameters. Additionally, if `odbcconf.exe` is invoked legitimately with a directive including a proper DLL name, the alert will not trigger. Analysts should also consider instances where legitimate software installations might employ `odbcconf.exe` without any malicious intent.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Insecure Transfer Via Curl.EXE" is designed to detect instances where the command-line utility `curl.exe` is executed with the `--insecure` flag. This flag instructs `curl` to bypass SSL certificate validation, presenting a significant security risk as it may expose sensitive data to man-in-the-middle attacks. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs to monitor for specific attributes such as the image name (i.e., `curl.exe`) and command-line arguments that include the insecure option. The identification of such a command is crucial as it indicates a potential attempt to transfer data insecurely, which could align with malicious activity. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of `Execution` (T1203 
  - Exploitation for Client Execution), highlighting the need for vigilance around tools that handle data transfers.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Logs**: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to check for recent executions of `curl.exe`, particularly focusing on timestamps that correspond with the alert and examining associated process trees.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Validate the command-line arguments used in the execution of the `curl.exe` process; look for the presence of the `--insecure` flag and note any suspicious or unfamiliar URLs being accessed.
  - **Examine Network Connections**: Inspect network logs for any activity initiated by the `curl.exe` process, especially outbound connections to unexpected or known malicious domains.
  - **Correlate with User Behavior**: Assess the user account associated with the execution of `curl.exe` to determine if it aligns with expected behavior, including checking for past legitimate use or access to development environments.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is categorized as medium due to the potential risk of data exposure and unauthorized transfers. Situations where `curl.exe` is executed with the `--insecure` flag warrant prompt investigation, especially if the context or destination of the data is not justifiable.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One primary blind spot is the possibility of legitimate use cases for `curl.exe` in internal or development environments where insecure connections may be necessary. Additionally, the rule may not fire if the executable is renamed or if scripts invoke `curl` through indirect means without matching the specific criteria outlined. Analysts should assume that advanced adversaries may employ custom tools or scripts to bypass such detections, making it essential to continually refine detection strategies.

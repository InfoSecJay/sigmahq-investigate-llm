  ### Technical Context
  The "HackTool 
  - WinPwn Execution" detection rule identifies potential use of the WinPwn tool, a utility commonly leveraged for reconnaissance and exploitation within Windows environments, particularly targeting Active Directory systems. This rule focuses on monitoring process creation logs to detect specific command-line parameters that indicate the execution of WinPwn. When processes are initiated with command lines containing keywords such as "Offline_Winpwn," "WinPwn," or variations like "WinPwn.exe" and "WinPwn.ps1," the rule flags these events due to their association with privilege escalation and discovery techniques, which may be indicative of malicious activity.
  The technical data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, where command-line arguments provide insight into the activities initiated by various applications. By analyzing these logs, the detection rule aims to help security teams promptly address potential security threats posed by the misuse of recognized hacking tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the alerts generated by the detection rule in your SIEM for instances of WinPwn execution to identify affected systems.
  - Utilize EDR solutions to investigate the process tree associated with the alerted command-line entries for any suspicious parent-child relationships or unusual behaviors.
  - Check relevant firewall logs to determine if there were any outbound connections initiated by the suspected WinPwn processes, which may suggest data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.
  - Examine Active Directory logs and user access patterns through cloud platforms such as Azure or AWS to identify any unauthorized access or anomalies tied to the execution of WinPwn.

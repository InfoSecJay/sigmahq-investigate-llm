  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled **HackTool 
  - WinPwn Execution** is designed to identify potential usage of the WinPwn tool through monitoring command line activity on Windows systems. WinPwn is a reconnaissance and exploitation tool specifically aimed at Windows and Active Directory environments, making it a point of interest for both red teaming and malicious activities. The rule captures instances where commands mention specific keywords associated with WinPwn, such as 'Offline_Winpwn', 'WinPwn', 'WinPwn.exe', and 'WinPwn.ps1'. It leverages process creation logs as the primary data source, which records every instance of new processes being initiated, including the command-line parameters used.
  This detection rule maps to several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, specifically under **Tactic: Credential Access (T1555)**, **Discovery (T1082)**, **Execution (T1203)**, and **Privilege Escalation (T1548)** among others. By focusing on these keywords, the rule can aid incident responders in recognizing potentially malicious behavior that may indicate an internal compromise or unauthorized user activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Command Line Execution:**
    Review process creation logs in your EDR for any instances where the command lines contain the keywords associated with WinPwn. Pay particular attention to the parent process for additional context.
  - **Correlate with Recent User Activity:**
    Analyze user activity within the Windows Security logs to identify if the user executing WinPwn commands has a legitimate business need or if their behavior appears suspicious.
  - **Review Network Connections:**
    Inspect network connection logs (using NDR or a firewall) for unusual outbound traffic patterns that coincide with the execution of the WinPwn commands to identify any possible data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Audit Related Security Events:**
    Check for related security events in the Windows Security log that may indicate unauthorized privilege escalation or other suspicious activities in tandem with the execution of WinPwn, such as attempted login failures or privilege changes.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the nature of the WinPwn tool being associated with potential compromise and exploitation within the network. Its detection indicates either an unauthorised tool execution or active reconnaissance, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the tool is executed with different command-line parameters not included in the specified keywords. Additionally, if attackers employ obfuscation techniques, such as changing the execution name or employing renamed scripts, the rule may not trigger. It assumes that the telemetry from process creation logs is being collected consistently across all endpoints, which may not be the case in environments with limited logging capabilities.

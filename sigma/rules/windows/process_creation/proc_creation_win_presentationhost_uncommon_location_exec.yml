  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "XBAP Execution From Uncommon Locations Via PresentationHost.EXE" is designed to identify potentially malicious executions of XBAP (XML Browser Applications) via the Windows PresentationHost.exe process. XBAP files can be exploited to execute harmful payloads while bypassing Application Whitelisting (AWL) mechanisms. This rule inspects process creation logs to monitor instances where PresentationHost.exe is invoked with a command line that includes ".xbap" and originates from locations that are not standard system directories like `C:\Windows\` or `C:\Program Files`. By focusing on uncommon file paths, this rule enhances the likelihood of identifying malicious activities. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion and Execution, specifically linked to technique T1218, which deals with the execution of applications from non-standard locations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Security logs for process creation events related to PresentationHost.exe, focusing on command lines containing ".xbap" to confirm the execution behavior.
  - **Cross-Reference File Locations:** Validate the paths from which the presentation host was executed against known software installations and configurations, identifying if the used path is uncommon.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Use EDR tools to investigate any network connections made by the executing process, which may indicate communication with a command and control server or suspicious external entities.
  - **Review User Activity:** Scrutinize user activity patterns surrounding the execution of the XBAP file to determine if the triggering user might be a victim of social engineering or other tactics leading to the execution.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as medium severity due to the potential use of XBAP files for malicious activities while recognizing that they can also be executed harmlessly in legitimate scenarios. Analysts should assess the broader context of occurrences to evaluate the genuine threat level.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the presence of execution logs for PresentationHost.exe is configured correctly and that the monitored file paths are comprehensive enough to capture uncommon locations. However, it may not trigger if malicious actors utilize commonly accepted paths or if PresentationHost.exe is executed in a manner not captured by the monitoring system. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate XBAP use in enterprise environments that may not align with standard installation directories.

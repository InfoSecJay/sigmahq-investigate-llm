  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Browser Started with Remote Debugging" is designed to detect instances where Chromium-based browsers or Firefox are launched with specific flags enabling remote debugging. This capability is often exploited by attackers for browser injection attacks, allowing them to manipulate webpage content or intercept credentials. The rule looks for command-line parameters associated with remote debugging, such as `--remote-debugging-` for Chromium-based browsers and `-start-debugger-server` for Firefox, within process creation logs. The primary data sources leveraged are Windows Process Creation logs, providing detailed insights into how applications are executed on user systems. This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Credential Access (T1185), highlighting the malicious potential of enabling remote debugging flags in browsers.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR to query process creation logs for any instances of browsers launched with remote debugging flags, focusing on command-line arguments.
  - **Investigate Related Network Connections:** Utilize firewall and web proxy logs to review outbound connections that may correlate with the browser activity flagged, identifying potential exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Examine user behavior in the context of the alert; check any unusual systems accessing sensitive information, especially around the timestamps of the detected events.
  - **Validate Security Event Logs:** Cross-reference Windows Security logs to determine if additional suspicious activities were recorded around the same time, providing context to the possible intent behind the browser start.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the inherent risk associated with remote debugging capabilities in browsers. Exploitation can lead to not only credential theft but also broader network compromise, warranting prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot is that this rule may not trigger when browsers are started with remote debugging flags that are not explicitly listed, or if an attacker uses alternative methods to achieve similar objectives without using these flags. Additionally, if Sysmon or adequate process logging is not deployed or properly configured on endpoints, the detection may fail completely. It is assumed that all systems are adequately monitored and that the necessary logging configurations are in place to identify such events.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Rundll32 Execution With Uncommon DLL Extension" is designed to detect potentially malicious usage of the `rundll32.exe` Windows application. This executable is commonly used for executing functions in DLLs, often making it a target for attackers aiming to evade detection. The rule focuses on command lines associated with `rundll32.exe` that do not include common DLL or other standard file extensions, thereby indicating potentially suspicious behavior. The data sources involved mainly include process creation logs captured by Sysmon, which provide detailed information about any command executed, including the original file name and the arguments passed.
  The rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and specifically the technique T1218.011, which pertains to the execution of remote DLLs using rundll32. By monitoring the command line for specified exclusions, this rule helps identify anomalous activities that could signal an attack or exploitation attempt.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use your EDR tool to examine process creation logs for instances of `rundll32.exe` that triggered the alert, paying close attention to the command line used during execution.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Check the command line parameters for any unusual or non-standard extensions. Look for unexpected strings that may indicate an attack vector, such as incomplete or odd file paths.
  - **Check Parent Process Context:** Investigate the context of the parent process that invoked `rundll32.exe`. This can provide insights into whether the execution was legitimate or part of a potentially nefarious chain of events.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference the findings with other telemetry data such as Windows Security logs, Sysmon network connections, and any relevant cloud logs to assess broader implications or collaboration with other malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is set to medium, suggesting that while the detected behavior may not immediately indicate a breach, it warrants prompt investigation due to its potential association with evasion techniques and the execution of untrusted code.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger under multiple scenarios, such as the absence of Sysmon logging or environments where process creation logging is disabled. Additionally, if an attacker uses common extensions or alters their tactics to mimic legitimate behaviors (e.g., placing payloads in standard directories), the rule may fail to fire or be bypassed. Engineers should account for potential environmental differences and the diverse tactics employed by adversaries when interpreting results.

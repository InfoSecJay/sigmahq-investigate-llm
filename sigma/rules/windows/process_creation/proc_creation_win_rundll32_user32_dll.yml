  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious Workstation Locking via Rundll32" is designed to detect potentially suspicious activities related to workstation locking through the `rundll32.exe` process in a Windows environment. The rule specifically looks for instances where `rundll32.exe` is called to execute a user32.dll function that locks the user workstation. This is an uncommon method for locking a workstation, typically performed via the keyboard shortcut (Windows+L) or from the Windows user interface. 
  The detection is based on multiple criteria, including the process creation logs where the `ParentImage` is `cmd.exe`, indicating that a command-line instruction initiated the action. Additionally, it examines command-line arguments to identify any calls to `user32.dll`, especially that involve the `LockWorkStation` function. By leveraging these parameters, the rule identifies potentially unauthorized or anomalous attempts to lock a workstation, which can be indicative of a defense evasion tactic by an adversary (under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of “Defense Evasion”).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in Windows Event Logs for instances of `rundll32.exe` with `cmd.exe` as the parent image to confirm the execution context.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command line arguments associated with the identified `rundll32.exe` process to identify calls to `user32.dll` and specifically the `LockWorkStation` function.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Check user activity logs to determine whether the workstation locking was initiated by legitimate user actions or if it corresponds with other suspicious behaviors.
  - **Investigate Related Network Activity:** Use EDR and NDR tools to analyze any network connections that may correlate with the time of the suspicious locking event to identify possible remote exploitation or command and control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered medium due to its potential to indicate unauthorized workstation locking, which could signify an attempt to disrupt user activity or safeguard unauthorized access on compromised systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker utilizes different methods to lock the workstation, such as direct use of the Windows interface or keyboard shortcuts. Additionally, legitimate scripts or tools that users might employ for workstation management are also likely to bypass detection. Assumptions include that the environment has not been sufficiently hardened to restrict the misuse of `rundll32.exe` or that user permissions allow for the execution of such commands without additional oversight.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "HackTool 
  - SharpEvtMute Execution" detects the execution of a specific tool, SharpEvtMute, known for tampering with Windows event logs. SharpEvtMute is designed to manipulate event records, effectively hiding or altering actions that may have taken place on a system, thus enabling adversaries to evade detection and maintain persistence. The rule primarily inspects process creation logs and evaluates the properties of running processes, particularly focusing on the file name "SharpEvtMute.exe" and associated command-line arguments that indicate filtering actions. 
  This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactic of defense evasion and the technique T1562.002, which highlights the modification of logs to hide malicious activity. The logs analyzed for this detection come primarily from Windows Sysmon, which is crucial for monitoring process creation events and their corresponding attributes, such as the command-line parameters that specify how the tool is being invoked.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Utilize the EDR to review any alerts related to the execution of `SharpEvtMute.exe`, focusing on the associated user account and any other processes spawned around the same time.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Inspect the command-line arguments in the process creation logs to determine if any filtering rules were applied that could suggest an attempt to obscure malicious activity.
  - **Correlate with Windows Event Logs**: Review the Windows Security logs for any unusual or suspicious logon activities or events occurring at the time of the process execution to identify potential malicious user activity.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Use NDR tools to analyze network traffic for any actions associated with the use of SharpEvtMute, such as outbound connections that may indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the nature of the tool being used; tampering with event logs could indicate an ongoing compromise or a significant security incident that necessitates immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  A potential blind spot with this rule involves environments where SharpEvtMute might not be present, leading to a lack of detection for other similar log tampering tools. Additionally, if an adversary renames the executable or uses other evasion techniques, the rule may fail to trigger. It is also assumed that the Sysmon configuration is adequately set up to log process creation events; if not, the detection capability will be limited.

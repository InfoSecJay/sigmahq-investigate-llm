  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potentially suspicious file downloads executed from IP addresses using the Wget utility, which is often utilized for downloading files via command-line. The rule analyzes process creation logs for instances where `wget.exe` is invoked with specific command-line parameters indicating a download from an IP address rather than a domain name, which is commonly associated with malicious activities. By focusing on the original filename and matching patterns in the command line for both a direct IP address and certain file extensions that could symbolize malicious payloads (like `.ps1`, `.exe`, `.dll`, etc.), the rule identifies potentially risky behavior. This detection is outlined under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically in the Execution tactic, as it tracks command execution for downloading files that may lead to further exploitation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Activity:** Review the endpoint detection response logs for the `wget.exe` process execution, including its parent process, to determine if it was executed legitimately or suspiciously.
  - **Analyze Network Logs:** Investigate firewall or network traffic logs to evaluate the destination IP address of the download, looking for known malicious IPs or other patterns indicative of compromised infrastructure.
  - **Correlate with AV and Security Logs:** Examine the antivirus logs for any detections or alerts that may indicate the downloaded file is malicious or flagged by security tools in the environment.
  - **Review User Activity and Context:** Cross-reference the user's activity with proxy logs to assess if there was unusual behavior surrounding the timeframe of the `wget.exe` execution that could support potential malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high-severity due to the potential risk of malicious payload delivery via direct IP address downloads, which can often be a precursor to further compromise if not investigated promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `wget.exe` is not present or utilized in the environment since some organizations may not use this tool for legitimate purposes. Furthermore, attackers might obfuscate their actions by invoking downloads from domain names or by using different tools, hence evading detection by this specific rule. The reliance on specific command-line patterns implies that any variations or alternative methods employed by adversaries could bypass detection entirely, including the use of encrypted connections or redirecting traffic through compromised intermediary servers.

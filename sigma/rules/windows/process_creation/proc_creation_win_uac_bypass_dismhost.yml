  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies potential User Account Control (UAC) bypass attempts via DLL hijacking specifically using the DismHost executable, which is a common technique employed by attackers for privilege escalation. The rule examines process creation events where the parent image is either `DismHost.exe`, located in the user profile or temporary directory, and checks for high integrity levels associated with process execution. The presence of high or system integrity levels (like S-1-16-16384 and S-1-16-12288) indicates that the process might be executing with elevated permissions, making it a prime target for malicious actors looking to bypass security controls. As defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this relates to the tactics of defense evasion and privilege escalation (T1548.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Details:** Investigate the EDR logs to analyze the process creation details including command-line parameters, parent-child relationships, and integrity levels related to the detected alert.
  - **Review System Event Logs:** Inspect Windows Event Logs (particularly Security and System logs) for any entries correlating with the times of the alert to understand the context and activities surrounding the execution of `DismHost.exe`.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to identify any suspicious outbound connections made by the alerted process, as this could indicate further malicious activity.
  - **Correlate Proxy Logs:** Check proxy logs for any unusual web requests or downloads that may have occurred around the time of the alert which could point to initial vector exploitation or further malicious downloads.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is high because successfully executing an UAC bypass can allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on a host system, potentially leading to greater compromise of sensitive data and systems within the organization. Prompt investigation is crucial to prevent further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if attackers utilize a different method to gain elevated privileges that do not involve the DismHost executable or if the user environment does not have UAC configured in a standard manner. Additionally, instances where the legitimate applications or processes are being used in an unexpected way could result in false negatives. It's also assumed that Sysmon is correctly configured to log process creation events, as misconfiguration can lead to missed detections.

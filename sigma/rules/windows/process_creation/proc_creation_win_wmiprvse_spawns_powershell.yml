  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect a specific behavior indicative of possible lateral movement within a Windows environment. It monitors the creation of PowerShell processes that spawn from the WMI Provider Host (`WmiPrvSE.exe`). This behavior is of interest because adversaries often employ Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for remote management tasks, including lateral movement, whereby they exploit WMI to execute scripts or commands on remote machines. Notably, this action is classified under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (specifically technique T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation) and Scripting (technique T1059.001: PowerShell).
  The detection logic leverages process creation logs, focusing on the parent-child relationship between `WmiPrvSE.exe` and `powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe`. When a PowerShell instance is detected as a child of `WmiPrvSE.exe`, it raises an alert, suggesting that a potential misuse of WMI for lateral movement may be occurring.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Investigate the alert in the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool to gather context on the involved processes, their execution parameters, and any associated user accounts. Check for other potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) in the timeline.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Examine relevant Windows Event Logs (Security and Sysmon). Specifically, look for Event IDs related to process creation that document the spawning of PowerShell from `WmiPrvSE.exe`.
  - **Investigate Network Activity:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to analyze any outbound or internal network traffic that may correlate with the WMI calls and confirm whether unauthorized communications are occurring.
  - **Check for False Positives:** Review the alert against known benign applications (listed in the false positives) to validate if this was a legitimate process or an indicator of possible exploitation. 
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium priority due to the potential for sophisticated lateral movement while still balancing the risk of false positives associated with legitimate administrative activities in the environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the adversary modifies their tactics, such as using different executable names or processes unrelated to `WmiPrvSE.exe`, or if they run PowerShell scripts directly without going through WMI. Additionally, benign usage of WMI-driven software like AppvClient, CCM, or WinRM could create alerts without malicious intent. Engineers should ensure to continuously validate and update the rule to increase effectiveness against evolving techniques used by adversaries.

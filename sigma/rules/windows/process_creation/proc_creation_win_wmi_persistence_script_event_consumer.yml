  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "WMI Persistence 
  - Script Event Consumer" aims to detect the creation of WMI Script Event Consumers, a technique sometimes exploited by threat actors to maintain persistence on a system. This rule specifically monitors the process creation logs for instances where `scrcons.exe`, located in the `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\` directory, is spawned with a parent process of `svchost.exe`. The WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) framework can be misused for various malicious activities, including privilege escalation and persistent malware deployment, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1546.003 (Event Triggered Execution). By focusing on the interplay between these processes, the rule seeks to identify potential backdoors that may have been introduced by an attacker.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Use your EDR tool to gather detailed information about the `scrcons.exe` process, including its start time, user context, and any associated command-line parameters to determine legitimacy.
  - **Examine Parentage:** Investigate the `svchost.exe` parent process through Windows Event Logs to review its associated services and check for any unauthorized behavior or misconfigurations.
  - **Inspect WMI Events:** Query the WMI repository for existing script event consumers to determine if any have been created in unexpected contexts, as this could indicate persistence measures taken by malicious actors.
  - **Cross-Reference Logs:** Analyze related logs such as firewall, proxy, and DNS to identify any suspicious outbound connections or unusual traffic patterns that may correlate with the execution of `scrcons.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  The detection of WMI Script Event Consumers is considered a medium severity alert due to the potential for abuse in maintaining persistence within the environment. While legitimate use cases exist, the presence of this process combined with specific parent-child relationships warrants further investigation to rule out malicious activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate applications or system activities also create WMI script event consumers, leading to possible false positives. Additionally, some systems, like Dell computers, may trigger known benign behaviors that could lead to alerts. It assumes that the corresponding telemetry sources (e.g., process creation logs) are adequately collected and monitored. Adversaries may attempt to disable or tamper with the detection mechanisms, or they may use alternative persistence techniques not captured by this rule.

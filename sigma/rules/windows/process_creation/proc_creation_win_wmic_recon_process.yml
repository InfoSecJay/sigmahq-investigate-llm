  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Process Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE" is designed to detect the use of the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool to gather process-related information on a compromised host. When adversaries seek to understand the environment they have infiltrated, they may use WMIC with the "process" flag to list running processes or to enumerate installed software and updates. This can assist them in identifying potential targets or vulnerabilities in the system.
  The rule focuses on monitoring the `process_creation` logs, specifically the execution of `WMIC.exe` along with command-line indications that include the term 'process'. It looks for parameters related to creating processes or calling them, thus highlighting potential reconnaissance activities consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation). By leveraging data sources from the Windows Security Event Logs and Sysmon (specifically events related to process creation and command-line execution), this detection rule can effectively flag suspicious use of WMIC that is indicative of a potential malicious actor scanning the system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs:** Investigate EDR alerts for suspicious uses of `WMIC.exe`. Look for command-line parameters that indicate process enumeration, focusing on any additional suspicious activity from the same source.
  - **Examine Process Creation Events:** Query process creation events in Sysmon logs for instances of `WMIC.exe` execution, specifically filtering for those with 'process' in the command line. Trace the parent-child relationship of that process to identify how it was initiated.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Analyze network connections associated with the user or system account that executed `WMIC.exe`. Look for unusual outbound connections that may indicate data exfiltration or communication with known malicious hosts.
  - **Consult Security and Application Logs:** Check Windows Security and Application logs for any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts around the time of the `WMIC.exe` usage. This can provide context to the actions performed.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for using `WMIC.exe` for reconnaissance, which can indicate that an adversary is gathering information about the environment. Such activities may precede more harmful actions, warranting a timely investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `WMIC.exe` is executed with obfuscation techniques or if it's initiated through a method not captured by standard telemetry, such as through a compromised service or script. Additionally, legitimate administrative uses of `WMIC.exe` could lead to false positives, thus understanding the context of the environment is crucial. Engineers should also note that sophisticated attackers may employ alternative tools or methods, bypassing this detection altogether.

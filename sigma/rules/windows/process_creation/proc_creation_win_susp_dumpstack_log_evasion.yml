  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential evasion techniques employed by adversaries to bypass Microsoft Defender by using a specific filename, `DumpStack.log`. The rule inspects process creation logs to detect when a process is spawned that uses the filename in its image path. Additionally, it checks command-line parameters for the presence of ` -o DumpStack.log`, which indicates an effort to manipulate the logging behavior. This detection targets the tactic of "Defense Evasion" (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1562), where adversaries may attempt to conceal malicious activities or files from security products, thus facilitating their operations undetected.
  The primary data sources utilized in this rule are related to process creation logs, specifically focusing on the image path of newly created processes and their associated command-line arguments. By monitoring these sources, the rule effectively identifies potentially malicious actions that could compromise enterprise systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **EDR Analysis:** Review EDR alerts for any instances involving `DumpStack.log` as part of the image path and assess the parent process to understand the context of execution.
    
  - **Command-Line Examination:** Analyze the command-line arguments associated with the suspicious process to ascertain if any additional parameters indicate malicious intent or further exploitation.
  - **File Examination:** Utilize file integrity monitoring or threat detection tools to check for the presence or modifications of `DumpStack.log` and related files within your windows environment.
  - **Networking Review:** Inspect network connections made by the process for any suspicious outbound communications or unusual data exfiltration patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this detection rule is considered critical as it indicates a potential bypass of endpoint protections, which poses a significant risk to the integrity and security of the organization's systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One limitation of this rule is its reliance on specific filenames and command-line parameters, which could be easily altered by sophisticated adversaries to evade detection. Furthermore, scenarios in which legitimate applications use the filename in benign contexts may lead to false positives. Additionally, the rule may not trigger if the evasion is performed through other means or if the adversary utilizes different file names altogether. Engineers should be aware that malicious actors may employ tactics that are not captured by this rule, necessitating multiple detection strategies for comprehensive threat coverage.

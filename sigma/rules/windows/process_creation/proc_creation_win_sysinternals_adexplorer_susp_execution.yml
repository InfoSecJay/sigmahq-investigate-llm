  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the execution of Sysinternals ADExplorer with the "-snapshot" flag. The rule aims to identify when this tool is utilized to create a copy of the Active Directory database and save it in potentially suspicious directories, such as Downloads, Public, AppData, and Windows Temp. The log sources leveraged for this detection include process creation logs, specifically focusing on attributes like the executable name (ADExplorer.exe) and command-line arguments. When an attacker seeks unauthorized access to sensitive directory data, this technique is documented under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for credential access (Attack ID: T1552.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs**: Review the endpoint detection logs to track the execution of ADExplorer.exe, including the command-line arguments and the user account that executed the process.
  - **Analyze Process Tree**: Investigate the process tree related to the ADExplorer execution to determine any parent or sibling processes that may indicate malicious behavior or lateral movement.
  - **Verify Directory Content**: Inspect the specified directories (Downloads, Public, AppData, Windows Temp) for newly created files that originated from the ADExplorer execution, especially any that appear to be database snapshots.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity**: Correlate the alert findings with user access logs to check if the user has legitimate privileges to execute such tasks against the Active Directory and if the timing aligns with any known malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity as it indicates a potentially unauthorized attempt to access sensitive data within the Active Directory, which may lead to further credential theft or network compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the execution of ADExplorer occurs without the "-snapshot" flag or if the tool is run from unmonitored directories. Additionally, legitimate administrative use of ADExplorer by authorized personnel could lead to false positives. It's also important to recognize that advanced adversaries may utilize different methods or obfuscate their activities, potentially evading detection.

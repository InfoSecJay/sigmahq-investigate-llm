  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potentially suspicious child processes spawned by `GoogleUpdate.exe`, which is the Google Software Update Service. The rule examines process creation logs to look for parent-child relationships, specifically where `GoogleUpdate.exe` is the parent process. The detection criteria include checks for child processes that are unusual or potentially malicious, such as installation executables (`setup.exe`, `chrome_updater.exe`, `chrome_installer.exe`) that may have been invoked unexpectedly. By scrutinizing the process creation activities, we can use this rule to mitigate the risk of malware disguising itself as legitimate Google update processes. The underlying MITRE ATT&CK tactic supported by this rule is "Defense Evasion," particularly focusing on the sub-technique of using legitimate processes for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize the EDR tool to analyze detailed process creation logs and verify the parent-child relationships involving `GoogleUpdate.exe`.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Parameters**: Check command-line arguments for the suspicious child processes to look for anomalies or unexpected execution patterns.
  - **Analyze File Integrity**: Use file monitoring tools to verify the hash values of the child processes; an unexpected hash could indicate a malicious variant of a legitimate tool.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Use network monitoring solutions to investigate any suspicious outbound connections made by the child processes to determine if there are indicators of exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity because processes spawned from `GoogleUpdate.exe` can often be leveraged by adversaries to execute malicious activities while remaining under the guise of a legitimate application, posing significant risk to enterprise systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if `GoogleUpdate.exe` is not present on the system, or if the attacker employs more advanced techniques such as process injection to execute their code without creating a child process directly from `GoogleUpdate.exe`. Additionally, setups with strict baseline controls may prevent legitimate updates from occurring, potentially leading to false negatives. It assumes that the environment has baseline knowledge of legitimate child processes related to Google applications for effective filtering.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential arbitrary Dynamic Link Library (DLL) sideloading attempts using Microsoft Word (WINWORD.exe) by monitoring specific command-line parameters. The rule focuses on identifying instances where the WINWORD process is initiated with the '/l' flag followed by a '.dll' file, which indicates a possible attempt to load an external DLL. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1202 
  - "Potential Arbitrary DLL Load," which categorizes arbitrary DLL loading as a defense evasion tactic. The primary data sources utilized in this rule include process creation logs, particularly monitoring the command-line arguments used during the execution of the WINWORD.exe process to identify suspicious patterns.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Use your EDR to check the timeline of the WINWORD.exe process creation and examine its command-line arguments for the use of '/l' and any associated DLL files.
  - **Analyze DLL Source:** Investigate the origin and integrity of any DLL files referenced in the command line by cross-referencing against known good files and consulting application logs or file repositories.
  - **Network Activity Review:** Monitor network connections initiated by WINWORD.exe to determine if there is unusual outbound activity correlating with the DLL loading attempt that may indicate further compromise.
  - **Review User Context:** Check the user account that executed WINWORD.exe for unusual behavior patterns or historical issues and assess whether this account has the privileges necessary for such actions.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is classified as medium due to the potential for misuse by malicious actors to load unauthorized code into a trusted application, which could be indicative of broader compromise attempts.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  Depending on the specific configurations of the Microsoft Office installation and user behavior, this rule may not fire if users have legitimate reasons for loading external DLLs or if the monitoring of the command-line parameters is not enabled in all environments. Additionally, adversaries could defeat this detection by using non-standard or obfuscated command-line arguments, or by leveraging alternative methods of executing unauthorized code. It is crucial to ensure comprehensive process creation logging is in place to minimize potential detection gaps.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify suspicious PowerShell commands that are commonly used to download files or content from the internet. By focusing on specific command-line parameters such as `.DownloadString()`, `.DownloadFile()`, and the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet (abbreviated as `iwr`), the rule can flag potential misuse of PowerShell indicating command-and-control activities or unauthorized file downloads. The primary data source for this rule is process creation logs on Windows systems, which capture the command-line arguments of executed processes. This allows incident responders to quickly assess whether such downloads were conducted maliciously or if they are legitimate operations performed by administrative scripts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review recent process creation logs in the EDR tool for instances of PowerShell execution that contain the flagged commands, paying close attention to the context of their execution.
  - Correlate the detected PowerShell activities with any internal scripts or scheduled tasks to determine if the command originated from a legitimate source.
  - Analyze network traffic logs and proxy data to identify connections that may have been established by the flagged PowerShell commands, focusing on unusual or unauthorized external domains.
  - Conduct a malware scan on the affected endpoint using the AV solution to ensure that no malicious payloads were downloaded as a result of the suspicious PowerShell execution.

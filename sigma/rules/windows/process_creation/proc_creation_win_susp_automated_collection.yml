  ### Technical Context
  The "Automated Collection Command Prompt" rule is designed to identify potential adversarial behavior associated with the collection of internal data within a Windows environment. It primarily examines process creation events, focusing on command-line arguments that typically indicate the automated gathering of documents and files. Key elements the rule looks for include file extensions often associated with documents (e.g., `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`) and common command-line options for the `dir` command, which retrieves file listings. Additionally, it checks for the presence of `FINDSTR.EXE`, a command-line utility for searching text within files, with arguments that suggest targeted data collection efforts.
  By correlating these patterns with activity logged in Windows process creation records, the rule addresses the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1119 (Automated Collection), which involves using automated methods to gather files and data within a network environment. The detection of such behavior could indicate an ongoing data exfiltration effort or reconnaissance within a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use the EDR tool to examine the process creation logs triggered by this rule, focusing on the command-line parameters that were executed. Look for unusual execution times or an unexpected lineage of processes.
  - **Assess File Access:** Utilize Windows Security logs to identify any files accessed based on the extensions detected in the alert. Verify if the access matches the intended user or if it shows signs of unauthorized activity.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Investigate network connections initiated around the time of the alert using NDR tools. Look for communications to external servers or unusual internal traffic that might indicate data exfiltration.
  - **Analyze Credential Use:** Examine logs related to user authentication and any suspicious activity in the context of credential access (e.g., logins from unusual locations). This can provide insights into whether compromised credentials were used to facilitate automated data collection.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered medium due to the potential risks associated with automated data collection. If left uninvestigated, such activity may lead to unauthorized data exfiltration or highlight a compromised system under adversarial control.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that adversaries will use common command-line utilities for data collection (like `FINDSTR.EXE` and `dir`), which might not always be the case. Additionally, if an adversary employs less common tools or processes, or if they obfuscate the command-line usage (e.g., through encoding), the detection may fail to trigger. False positives may occur due to legitimate administrative tasks that utilize similar command patterns, making thorough investigation necessary.

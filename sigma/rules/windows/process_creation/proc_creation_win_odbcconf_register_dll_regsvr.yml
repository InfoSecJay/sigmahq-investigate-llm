description: Detects execution of "odbcconf" with "REGSVR" in order to register a
  new DLL (equivalent to running regsvr32). Attackers abuse this to install and run
  malicious DLLs.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "New DLL Registered Via Odbcconf.EXE" identifies potentially malicious actions taken by adversaries using the `odbcconf.exe` utility to register Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) with the `REGSVR` command. While `odbcconf.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing ODBC data sources, attackers often exploit it to register unauthorized or hidden DLLs in order to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. The rule monitors for two main indicators: the execution of `odbcconf.exe` and the presence of `REGSVR` in the command line options alongside any file ending with `.dll`. This detection is rooted in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under T1218.008 which addresses the use of signed binaries for defense evasion techniques.
  The primary technical data sources utilized in this detection rule include process creation logs that capture information about the execution of `odbcconf.exe`, the command-line parameters used during its execution, and the original filename associated with the processes. In a larger security context, this enables SOC analysts to identify when adversarial methods are being employed to manipulate DLL registrations, which could signify a malicious attempt at gaining control over the system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Command Line Execution:** Check the command line logs for `odbcconf.exe`. Confirm that it contains the terms `REGSVR` and `.dll` to validate if the registered DLL is potentially malicious.
  - **Analyze Process Tree:** Utilize EDR solutions to trace the process tree and identify the parent and child processes related to `odbcconf.exe`. This context can provide insights into the execution timeline and other processes potentially involved.
  - **Inspect DLL Path and Hash:** Review the file path and hash of the DLL being registered. Look for known benign DLLs or check against threat intelligence databases to ascertain whether the DLL is associated with known malware.
  - **Explore User and System Behavior:** Analyze historical user and system behavior around the time of the event. Unusual behavior patterns might reveal unauthorized access or misuse of the account that executed `odbcconf.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity due to the capability of the detected behavior to bypass certain security controls and potentially compromise system integrity through unauthorized DLL registrations. It is crucial to investigate promptly to mitigate risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if legitimate applications are using `odbcconf.exe` for authorized tasks, potentially leading to a higher number of false positives. Additionally, skilled adversaries might employ techniques to obfuscate the malicious usage, like using different command flags or executing processes under different parent processes. The reliance on specific command-line patterns poses a risk if these patterns change due to legitimate software updates or misuse. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adjustment of detection criteria may be necessary to keep pace with evolving tactics.

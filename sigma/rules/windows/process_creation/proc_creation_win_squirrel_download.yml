  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Arbitrary File Download Via Squirrel.EXE" identifies potential threats involving the misuse of the Squirrel.exe application, which is commonly found in various Electron-based software (such as Slack, Teams, and Discord). This rule leverages the process creation log data from Windows to track activities where Squirrel.exe is used to download files using specific command-line parameters or keywords. The rule specifically looks for command-line argument patterns indicative of download or update activities, namely those that contain "--download", "--update", or "http". 
  By monitoring for these behaviors, the rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of 'Execution' (T1218) and 'Defense Evasion', as adversaries may leverage widely-used applications to obfuscate malicious activities and bypass security mechanisms. The usage of an application that is often trusted in the enterprise environment makes this detection crucial for identifying potential unauthorized file downloads, which attackers may use for data exfiltration or malware delivery.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Activity:** Review process creation logs for instances of Squirrel.exe or update.exe to establish if the applications were invoked from expected paths and by legitimate processes.
  - **Examine Command-Line Parameters:** Inspect the command-line parameters of the identified processes to determine if they include the suspicious flags indicating a file download or update process.
  - **Utilize EDR Tools:** Use EDR capabilities to analyze the reputation of the downloaded files and to check if they exhibit suspicious behaviors following their execution.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Investigate network connections made during the time frame of the alert to identify any connections to known malicious IPs or domains associated with unauthorized downloads.
  ### Prioritization
  Due to the potential use of trusted applications for downloading arbitrary files, this alert is prioritized as medium severity. The implications include possible unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data, warranting prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger in environments where Squirrel.exe is extensively used for legitimate purposes, leading to expected false positives. Additionally, if an adversary modifies the command-line parameters or employs alternative techniques to execute similar download actions, the rule may fail to identify the activity. It is assumed that common Electron applications are properly monitored; however, there could be instances where less common Electron applications remain undetected.

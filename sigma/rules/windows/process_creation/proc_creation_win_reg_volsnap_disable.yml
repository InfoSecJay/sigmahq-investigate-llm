  ### Technical Context
  The "Disabled Volume Snapshots" Sigma rule is designed to detect potential malicious activity involving the Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). By monitoring process creation events that include specific command-line parameters, the rule identifies when an executable attempts to disable volume snapshots. Specifically, it looks for commands that contain both the path to the VSS diagnostics tool (`\Services\VSS\Diag`) and the argument specifying the action to disable snapshots (`/d Disabled`). This activity can indicate an adversary's intent to evade detection by removing backups or restoring points that may contain artifacts of their activities. The rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001, which relates to defense evasion strategies.
  The primary data sources used for this detection are Windows security logs, particularly process creation events logged by Sysmon. These logs capture the details of executed processes, including command-line arguments, allowing SOC analysts to identify potentially harmful commands and investigate further.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Search Windows Security or Sysmon logs for the specific command line that matches the conditions defined in the Sigma rule. Focus on the timestamps relative to other suspicious activity.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Alerts:** Utilize your EDR to cross-reference with any concurrent alerts that may indicate further malicious behavior, such as unexpected file modifications or unusual network activity.
  - **Analyze Volume Shadow Copies:** Check for any changes made to volume shadow copies using the `vssadmin list shadows` command. Investigate the integrity of existing snapshots and examine their metadata for unusual timestamps or alterations.
  - **Consult Additional Logs:** Review additional logs from Windows Event Viewer, firewall, or proxy to search for any connections or downloads of suspicious binaries from external sources that might relate to this command execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as high due to the potential for attackers to interfere with recovery and backup solutions that could hinder post-incident forensic analysis in an enterprise environment. Disabling volume snapshots can be a critical step for adversaries aiming to maintain persistence while evading detection.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that the appropriate event logging level is enabled in the Windows environment, particularly around process creation events. It may not trigger if legitimate administration commands are executed or if the attacker uses alternate methods to disable volume snapshots, such as utilizing a custom script or exploiting existing system vulnerabilities. Additionally, highly skilled adversaries may employ techniques to obfuscate their command execution, thus evading detection by this rule.

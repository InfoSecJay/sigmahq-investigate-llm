title: BitLockerTogo.EXE Execution
id: 7f2376f9-42ee-4dfc-9360-fecff9a88fc8
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the execution of "BitLockerToGo.EXE".
  BitLocker To Go is BitLocker Drive Encryption on removable data drives. This feature includes the encryption of, USB flash drives, SD cards, External hard disk drives, Other drives that are formatted by using the NTFS, FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT file system.
  This is a rarely used application and usage of it at all is worth investigating.
  Malware such as Lumma stealer has been seen using this process as a target for process hollowing.

  ### Technical Context
  The "BitLockerTogo.EXE Execution" rule is designed to detect the initiation of the BitLocker To Go application, which is used for encrypting removable drives such as USB flash drives and external hard disks. The rule focuses on monitoring process creation events specifically for the executable file `BitLockerToGo.exe`. This application is not commonly employed in typical enterprise environments, and its usage should be investigated as it may indicate malicious activity, particularly as certain malware variants, like the Lumma stealer, have been known to leverage this process for nefarious purposes such as process hollowing. The detection is based on process creation logs sourced from Windows systems, and it aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's defense evasion tactic (T1218), where attackers might use trusted applications to evade detection while conducting malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your EDR tool to confirm that `BitLockerToGo.exe` was executed. Pay attention to the user context and the parent process to determine if the execution was legitimate or suspicious.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Check the command-line parameters associated with the `BitLockerToGo.exe` execution. Look for any unusual flags or arguments that may indicate malicious intent or misuse of the application.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use network detection tools to review any subsequent outbound connections made by the execution of this process. Investigate any connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains that correspond with the timing of the detected execution.
  - **Enrich with File Activity Logs:** Cross-reference the detected execution with any file activity logs related to external drives. This can help to determine if any sensitive data is being encrypted or exfiltrated unceremoniously.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a low severity rating in our enterprise environment due to the possibility of legitimate usage of `BitLockerToGo.exe` for encrypting portable devices. However, the rule is essential for highlighting potential abuse, warranting further investigation to mitigate risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized blind spot is the possibility of `BitLockerToGo.exe` executing in environments where it is commonly used without any malicious intent, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an adversary manages to disable process logging or employs techniques to masquerade their actions (e.g., executing binary files with altered naming), this detection may not trigger. Furthermore, if group policies restrict access to certain users or roles for executing this tool, legitimate uses may not be accounted for, complicating the detection of malicious activities.

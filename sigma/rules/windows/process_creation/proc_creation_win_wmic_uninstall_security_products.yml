  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potentially malicious activity involving the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility, specifically aimed at the uninstallation or termination of security products. Attackers often utilize WMIC to bypass conventional security mechanisms by uninstalling security software silently, thereby evading detection. The rule inspects command-line arguments associated with process creation events by looking for specific patterns indicating the use of WMIC for uninstalling, deleting, or terminating security applications. Key indicators include 'wmic' in the command line followed by phrases like 'product where', 'call uninstall', 'call terminate', and references to known security product names like 'Symantec', 'McAfee', or 'Cylance'. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1562.001), highlighting a typical adversary technique for disabling protective tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs for entries matching the WMIC execution and related command-line flags that could indicate unauthorized uninstallation of security software.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Use EDR to analyze any suspicious processes associated with the WMIC command being executed, paying attention to whether any legitimate users initiated the command.
  - **Check for Related Network Activity:** Inspect network connections and logs for any unusual patterns or communications originating from systems where the WMIC command was executed, which could indicate further compromise.
  - **Analyze User Privileges and Logs:** Investigate the user account that executed the WMIC commands to ensure it has an appropriate role and review their activity logs for any anomalies that could indicate malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of security product tampering. Unauthorized changes to security controls pose significant risks to the entire enterprise environment, potentially leading to undetected threats and exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary implements WMIC commands in a manner that avoids detection, such as altering command-line syntax not captured by the rule or utilizing other means to disable security products. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions might lead to false positives, implying a thorough investigation is necessary to validate the alert prior to escalating. Moreover, reliance on the presence of security products listed may miss emerging or unmonitored applications that could be targeted.

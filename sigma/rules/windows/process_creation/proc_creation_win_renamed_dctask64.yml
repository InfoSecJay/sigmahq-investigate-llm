id: 340a090b-c4e9-412e-bb36-b4b16fe96f9b
status: test
description: |
  Detects a renamed "dctask64.exe" execution, a signed binary by ZOHO Corporation part of ManageEngine Endpoint Central.
  This binary can be abused for DLL injection, arbitrary command and process execution.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Renamed ZOHO Dctask64 Execution" targets the execution of a potentially malicious instance of a legitimate application, specifically a renamed version of "dctask64.exe" from ZOHO Corporation, which is part of ManageEngine Endpoint Central. This executable is primarily used for remote management and automation tasks but can be abused by adversaries for DLL injection, arbitrary command execution, or other malicious activities. The rule detects instances where this binary is executed under a different name than its legitimate form, focusing on specific IMPHASH values that are characteristic of renamed malicious files. The detection leverages Windows process creation logs as the primary data source, monitoring the attributes such as image name and hash values. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of "Defense Evasion" (T1036), "Process Injection" (T1055.001), and "Exploitation of Remote Services" (T1202), making it critical for identifying threats that seek to evade detection through legitimate tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation:** Check the process creation logs in your EDR tool for additional contextual information, including parent processes and execution paths of the renamed dctask64.exe binary.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Using the NDR or NGFW tools, look for any unusual outbound network connections initiated by the process, which could indicate data exfiltration or callback communications.
  - **Hash Comparison:** Utilize AV or endpoint protection tools to scan for known malicious hashes listed in the detection rule to understand if any related threats are present on the system.
  - **Investigate User Behavior:** Review the user activity logs in Windows Security to determine if the execution aligns with legitimate user behavior patterns or if it appears anomalous.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because the execution of a renamed legitimate process can indicate an active threat, like malware attempting to exploit legitimate software for malicious ends, thus posing significant risk to enterprise systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger if the adversary utilizes a different method to obfuscate the executable or employs a renaming strategy that does not fit the provided IMPHASH values. Additionally, the execution of the original, legitimate dctask64.exe binary may not be detected as malicious if proper security controls are in place, thus leading to possible false negatives. Other potential blind spots include environments where process creation logging is not fully enabled or where anti-virus signatures do not capture this specific malicious behavior.

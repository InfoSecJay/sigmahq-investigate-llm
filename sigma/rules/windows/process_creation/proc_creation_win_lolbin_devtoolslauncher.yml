  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects instances where `devtoolslauncher.exe`, a legitimate Windows binary often used for development purposes, executes other binaries, specifically when the command line contains the parameter `LaunchForDeploy`. This activity is associated with potential evasive actions taken by attackers, where they leverage legitimate tools and processes to carry out malicious activities. The detection leverages process creation logs, specifically focusing on the image names and command-line entries of running processes.
  From a cybersecurity perspective, this activity is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1218: Signed Binary Proxy Execution**, which highlights how adversaries may use legitimate executables to evade detection. The use of `devtoolslauncher.exe` for these means could suggest an attempt at defense evasion, particularly in environments where avoidance of detection is essential for achieving their objectives.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Details:** Use EDR tools to retrieve detailed process information for instances of `devtoolslauncher.exe`, focusing on the parent-child relationship of processes to identify any suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Check the command-line parameters associated with `devtoolslauncher.exe` executions in Windows Event Logs for instances of `LaunchForDeploy` to confirm the context of execution.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Utilize network monitoring tools to examine outbound connections made by `devtoolslauncher.exe` to determine if any suspicious network activity is associated with the process.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Look into user activity logs, including authenticated sessions and system events, to verify if the execution aligns with legitimate development activities.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this rule could indicate the execution of potentially malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process, alerts triggered by this detection should be treated with a high severity level. The nature of the executable involved and the manipulation of command-line arguments highlight a significant risk that requires prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot for this rule is the legitimate use of `devtoolslauncher.exe` by authorized users, which can lead to false positives in alerts. Additionally, the rule may not trigger if an attacker uses a different mechanism or command that does not include the specified parameter `LaunchForDeploy`. The effectiveness of this detection will also depend on comprehensive logging configurations; if logs are missing or incomplete, then instances of this behavior may go undetected.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Use of Scriptrunner.exe" is designed to detect potentially malicious uses of the `Scriptrunner.exe` binary in a Windows environment. This executable can be manipulated to execute scripts and proxy execution, thereby allowing an attacker to bypass security measures such as whitelisting. The rule focuses on key indicators of compromise, specifically targeting process creation logs for the `Scriptrunner.exe` file and its command-line arguments, particularly those containing the flag `-appvscript`. By analyzing these elements, the detection aims to identify instances where this tool might be inappropriately used to execute unauthorized scripts or commands. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1218: Signs of Malicious Execution) and Execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize your EDR tool to examine recent process creation events for instances of `Scriptrunner.exe` to determine the context and frequency of its invocation.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Check the command-line parameters associated with identified `Scriptrunner.exe` instances, paying close attention to those containing `-appvscript` to assess potential unauthorized execution.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Verify the legitimacy of the user account associated with the suspicious invocation by cross-referencing with user activity logs to see if the access aligns with typical usage patterns.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Use network detection tools to look for outbound or suspicious connections initiated by processes running `Scriptrunner.exe`, which may indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that `Scriptrunner.exe` can be legitimately used in environments where Application Virtualization (App-V) is deployed, this alert should be treated with medium severity. However, any alerts warrant careful investigation to assess the context of its usage.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if `Scriptrunner.exe` is used in a legitimate context, especially in environments where App-V is actively managed and monitored. Additionally, an adversary could rename or modify the original executable, thus evading detection. There is an assumption that the file paths or command-line arguments are consistent with known malicious behavior, which may not always be the case, as legitimate applications may also use similar parameters.

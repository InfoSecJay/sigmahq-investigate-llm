  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting the use of `ScriptRunner.exe` aims to identify potential abuse of this binary, which can be exploited to bypass application whitelisting and execute arbitrary commands. Specifically, the rule focuses on two key indicators: the presence of `ScriptRunner.exe` itself, as indicated by its image name and original file name, as well as the command-line parameters that include `-appvscript`. The detection leverages process creation logs sourced from Windows systems, which provide detailed information about executable processes, including the full command line used during execution. By monitoring these elements, the rule helps security operations centers (SOCs) detect potentially malicious uses of a typically legitimate application.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the relevant process creation logs in your EDR solution to identify instances of `ScriptRunner.exe` being executed along with the complete command-line parameters.
  - Utilize your AV or endpoint security tool to check for any associated alerts or threats that may indicate malicious behavior linked to the `ScriptRunner.exe` execution.
  - Investigate the context of the execution by examining logs from your Proxy or web filtering solution for any unusual outbound connections during the time of the alert.
  - If applicable, cross-reference with cloud service logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail or Azure Activity Logs) to identify any anomalies that may correlate with the execution of `ScriptRunner.exe`.

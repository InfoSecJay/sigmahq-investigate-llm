  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "PUA 
  - 3Proxy Execution" is designed to detect instances where the 3proxy application, a free lightweight proxy server, is executed on Windows systems. This rule focuses on process creation logs to identify the use of the executable `3proxy.exe`, which may suggest potential misuse in a command-and-control scenario as per the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1572 (Application Layer Protocol). The rule examines different characteristics of the execution activity, including the process image name, the description associated with it, and the command-line parameters that indicate local network proxy configurations. By leveraging Windows process creation telemetry, security analysts can identify potential unauthorized or unauthorized proxy activity, which may facilitate data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Information:** Start by querying the EDR for detailed process creation events that involve `3proxy.exe` to understand its execution context, such as parent process and user account.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line arguments attached to the execution of `3proxy.exe` to determine any potentially malicious configurations, such as unusual IP addresses or port numbers other than the expected defaults.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic Logs:** Examine network connections and logs within the firewall or network detection system to identify if the proxy is being used to communicate with any external malicious nodes or command-and-control servers.
  - **Conduct User Activity Review:** Analyze the activities of the user account under which `3proxy.exe` was executed to evaluate whether this action aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or if it deviates from typical behavior patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential risks associated with the use of unauthorized proxy servers, which can lead to data breaches or support covert command-and-control communications, suggesting immediate investigation is warranted.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are potential blind spots in environments where standard administrative tasks involve the use of authorized proxy servers, which can lead to false positives. Additionally, if the attacker uses alternative methods to run `3proxy.exe` or modifies its filename, the detection rule may not trigger. This rule may also not capture instances where proxying occurs through embedded scripts or other less conventional means.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious PowerShell Download and Execute Pattern" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious PowerShell commands that exhibit characteristics such as downloading and executing scripts or binaries from remote locations. Specifically, this rule targets commands that utilize the .NET `WebClient` class to execute a string from a remote source, a common tactic employed by various malware, including stagers and downloaders, to compromise systems. The rule operates by monitoring process creation logs for command lines containing signatures indicative of such downloads, including variations of the `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` command that leverage `New-Object` to fetch and run remote scripts or files. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic **Execution** and specifically relates to technique **T1059.001: PowerShell**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Logs:** Check EDR logs for the identified PowerShell command execution timestamps to understand the context of the invocation, including the user account and originating workstation.
  - **Analyze Command Line Details:** Investigate the full command line used in the process creation event to identify the specific script or file being downloaded and executed, which may provide insight into the actor's intentions.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Examine network logs to determine if there were any outbound connections made to suspicious or known malicious domains correlated with the timestamps of the PowerShell commands.
  - **Check for System Changes:** Assess any changes made to the system or user profiles around the time of the alert, verifying if any unauthorized installations or modifications occurred.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been assigned a high severity level due to the significant risk posed by executing potentially malicious scripts directly from PowerShell, which could lead to system compromises, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in instances where the command uses obfuscation techniques or variations not covered by the provided command signatures. Additionally, transient legitimate software installers that pull scripts or packages from remote sources may generate false positives. Analysts should also consider that an adversary could bypass this detection by using alternate methods of execution or different scripting mechanisms that do not utilize PowerShell.

  ### Technical Context
  The rule detects the uninstallation of Sysinternals Sysmon, a system monitoring tool used for tracking security-relevant activities on a Windows system. Uninstalling Sysmon may indicate an attempt by an adversary to evade detection mechanisms, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of “Defense Evasion” (T1562.001). The detection relies on two primary data sources: process creation logs and command-line parameters. It looks for the execution of `Sysmon.exe` or `Sysmon64.exe` with a command line that contains the argument `-u`, which signifies an uninstallation request.
  By monitoring these specific indicators, the rule flags potential uninstallation events for further investigation. Legitimate administrative actions, such as debugging processes or maintenance, could also trigger this rule; hence, in an enterprise environment, alert triage is necessary to ascertain the intent behind the uninstallation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Examine Windows Security logs for process creation events related to `Sysmon.exe` and `Sysmon64.exe` to identify the source and initiator of the uninstallation process.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Look at the command-line arguments provided during the uninstallation to verify if the `-u` flag was used and to determine if the request was initiated by a legitimate administrator or an unauthorized user.
  - **Check User Account Activity:** Use EDR tools to investigate the user accounts involved in the uninstallation event for any unusual patterns or recent activities that could hint at malicious intent.
  - **Evaluate Historical Context:** Review historical logs around the time of the uninstallation to identify any preceding suspicious behavior, including other security events or failed login attempts relevant to the involved user account.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert holds a high severity level as the uninstallation of Sysmon could signify an intentional effort by an attacker to disable monitoring capabilities, potentially facilitating further malicious activities within the environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker utilizes methods to disguise their activities or employs alternate names for the Sysmon executable outside of the expected naming conventions. Additionally, if Sysmon was already uninstalled without the specified indicating behavior captured, this alert would not trigger. The assumption exists that any system administrators with rightful access could uninstall software legitimately, potentially leading to false positives if not corroborated with contextual analysis.

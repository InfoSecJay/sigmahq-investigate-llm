  definition: Since options '-d' and '-p' were removed in Windows 10 this rule is
    relevant only for Windows before 10. And as Windows 7 doesn't log command line
    in 4688 by default, to detect this attack you need Sysmon 1 configured or KB3004375
    installed for command-line auditing

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "DLL Execution via Rasautou.exe" is designed to detect the loading of arbitrary Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) using the Rasautou.exe process. This command-line utility, typically used for Remote Access Service, has the capability to execute specified exports of a DLL when manipulated using specific command-line arguments ('-d' for the DLL path and '-p' for the export function). The rule leverages data collected from process creation logs, specifically looking for instances where Rasautou.exe is invoked with these command-line parameters. Since this behavior is indicative of a potential defense evasion technique, it aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (TA0005) and technique T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution). Given that this rule is only relevant for Windows versions prior to Windows 10, organizations must ensure appropriate logging mechanisms, such as Sysmon or the application of KB3004375, are in place to capture relevant command-line activity when using those older systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation logs (Sysmon or Event ID 4688) to identify instances of Rasautou.exe being executed, paying special attention to the associated command-line arguments that include '-d' and '-p'.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line parameters of the detected instance to confirm if arbitrary DLLs were indeed invoked and which exports were specified. Look for potentially malicious DLLs based on known threat intelligence.
  - **Correlate with File Activity:** Search for file creation and modification events related to the DLLs specified in the Rasautou.exe command to determine if they are legitimate or potentially malicious. Cross-reference with hash databases for known malicious DLLs.
  - **Conduct Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network connection logs for unusual communication patterns that might indicate a callback or data exfiltration related to the process that executed Rasautou.exe.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is deemed medium severity due to the potential for attackers to leverage legitimate system processes like Rasautou.exe to evade detection mechanisms. It denotes suspicious activities that can lead to significant compromises, necessitating further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments that primarily operate on Windows 10 or later, as the command-line arguments '-d' and '-p' are not applicable on those systems. Additionally, environments without Sysmon configured or where relevant Windows updates are absent may lack visibility into command-line audits, leading to missed detections. Attackers may also modify their tactics to obfuscate their actions, exploiting legitimate executables without triggering this detection rule.

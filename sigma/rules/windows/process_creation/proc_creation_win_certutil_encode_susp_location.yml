  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "File In Suspicious Location Encoded To Base64 Via Certutil.EXE" identifies instances where the Windows command-line utility `certutil.exe` is used to encode files into Base64 format. The rule focuses on situations where the encoding is performed with the `-encode` flag and targets files located in commonly abused directories known for transient or temporary files, such as `AppData\Roaming`, `Desktop`, and `Temp` folders. Detection is based on process creation logs, specifically looking for the command-line parameters used in conjunction with the `certutil.exe` executable. This rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1027, which deals with defense evasion tactics that adversaries may employ to hide their activities within the victim's environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Search for Related Processes:** Examine the EDR solution to identify any other related processes that may have executed `certutil.exe`. Look for abnormal parent/child process relationships that might indicate malicious activity.
    
  - **Analyze File Locations:** Review the specific file paths referenced in the alert to determine if these locations were previously compromised or frequently accessed by authorized users. Assess the files for any unusual attributes or behaviors.
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters:** Check the command-line arguments used with `certutil.exe` in the event logs. Malicious usage often has specific flags or altered parameters that differ from legitimate use cases.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize NDR or proxy logs to identify any outbound connections initiated around the same time as the encoding activity. This could reveal whether the encoded files were exfiltrated or sent to a command-and-control server.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for encoding files for malicious purposes, such as hiding sensitive data exfiltration or disguising malware payloads. The presence of such activity in sensitive or transient file directories raises concerns about active exploitation attempts or ongoing malicious operations.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire if `certutil.exe` is run from a non-standard executable image that is attempting to evade detection or if other encoding methods are used entirely. Analysts should also be aware that legitimate use cases of `certutil.exe`, particularly in system administration tasks, may produce false positives. Additionally, if the encoding occurs in directories not included in the suspicious list, the rule may not trigger. Therefore, it is important to have context around the users and processes in the environment that may use this command legitimately.

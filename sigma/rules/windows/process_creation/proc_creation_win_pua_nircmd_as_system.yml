  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "PUA 
  - NirCmd Execution As LOCAL SYSTEM" leverages Windows process creation logs to identify the execution of the NirCmd command-line tool running under the SYSTEM user context. It specifically searches for command lines containing the substring 'runassystem', which is indicative of this tool being used to run commands with elevated privileges. By monitoring the CommandLine field, along with the ParentCommandLine field for contextual insights, the rule can effectively signal potential misuse of the NirCmd tool. This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1569.002 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell) and technique T0029 (Command-Line Interface), highlighting its relevance in identifying execution-based threats within the enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review process creation logs in your SIEM or EDR that captured the instance of NirCmd running as the SYSTEM user. Pay close attention to the CommandLine and ParentCommandLine fields for any suspicious activity.
    
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate related events for the SYSTEM account or any user-initiated actions leading to this execution to determine the legitimacy of the usage. This can help distinguish between administrative tasks and potential adversarial behavior.
    
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Utilize network detection resources (NDR, Proxy) to spot any outbound connections made by NirCmd that could indicate data exfiltration or command and control (C2) activity. 
  - **Review Security Events:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for user authentication events prior to the command execution to establish a timeline and ascertain if any unauthorized access may have occurred.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because the execution of NirCmd as the SYSTEM user can indicate potential misuse of powerful system utilities, which may facilitate unauthorized access or malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if NirCmd is executed with different command-line arguments or if it utilizes alternate execution methods that do not incorporate 'runassystem'. Additionally, legitimate administrative use of NirCmd by system administrators may result in false positives. It is also assumed that proper logging is in place and not altered, as modifications to log visibility could prevent detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potentially suspicious execution of Microsoft Office applications, notably when they reference documents located in trusted directories. This detection is critical because attackers often exploit trusted locations to execute malicious Office documents while bypassing macro security protections that are typically in place. The rule monitors for process creation events specifically targeting Office applications such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. It examines the command line of these processes to identify if they are being executed from known trusted locations, including common folders under `AppData\Roaming\Microsoft` and the `Microsoft Office` directory.
  For effective detection, the rule utilizes Windows process creation logs as the primary telemetry source, leveraging images with specific filenames and original file names associated with these Office applications. It also ensures that the detected command lines are not related to benign template file types (with extensions like `.dotx`, `.xltx`, or `.potx`), which could indicate legitimate usage. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1202, focusing on defense evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation logs in your EDR to identify any instances of Excel, PowerPoint, or Word being executed, especially focusing on their associated command line parameters.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command line details for any references to trusted document locations, confirming if they contain potentially suspicious file paths or parameters.
  - **Cross-Check with User Behavior:** Compare the triggered alert against user activity logs to ascertain the legitimacy of the Office document execution and whether it fits within normal user behavior.
  - **Correlate with Other Threat Indicators:** Use SIEM tools to correlate the detected activity with other indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as abnormal network connections, potential malware alerts from AV, or unusual DNS queries.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential risk associated with executing Office documents from trusted locations. Such actions can indicate an attempt by adversaries to evade security controls and deliver malicious payloads undetected.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if an adversary manages to manipulate or produce office documents from locations not included in the trusted directory list. Additionally, if users have added custom trusted document locations, these will not be monitored unless explicitly defined. The detection may also be bypassed if an attacker uses the original document file type extensions, such as `.dotx`, `.xltx`, or `.potx`, in a benign context that doesn't trigger the filtering mechanism. Understanding these nuances is essential for detection engineers and incident responders to improve the rule's efficacy.

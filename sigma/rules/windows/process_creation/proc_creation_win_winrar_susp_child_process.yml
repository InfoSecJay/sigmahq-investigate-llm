  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potentially suspicious child processes spawned by `WinRAR.EXE`, a popular file compression tool, which might be exploited by attackers. Specifically, the rule examines process creation logs to identify instances where `WinRAR.EXE` serves as the parent process for various command-line utilities and scripting engines commonly associated with malicious activity, such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `wscript.exe`. By monitoring the interactions between processes, this rule helps identify execution patterns that could indicate an exploit or malicious intent within the environment.
  The rule leverages telemetry data from Windows process creation logs, capturing relevant fields such as `ParentImage`, the `Image` of the child process, and `OriginalFileName`. These data points are critical as they enable the detection of known binaries that may signify an attack chain. This particular detection is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1203, which covers vulnerabilities leveraged for execution through user interaction. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Parent Process**: Verify the presence of `WinRAR.EXE` as the parent process in the EDR logs to establish context for the potentially suspicious child process behavior.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments**: Analyze the command-line parameters associated with the flagged child processes using the Sysmon logs to identify any red flags or abnormal scripts invoked.
  - **Cross-reference with Threat Intelligence**: Utilize threat intelligence platforms to correlate the identified child process binaries against known malicious activity or recent CVEs to better assess the risk level.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Investigate outbound network connections initiated by the child processes using NDR logs to determine if any command-and-control communications are occurring.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is set to medium, indicating that while it does not immediately signify a confirmed compromise, it warrants prompt investigation due to the potential exploitation of `WinRAR.EXE` and the associated risks tied to the child processes being executed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in scenarios where the attacker chooses to obfuscate their method by utilizing less common or non-standard execution paths, potentially bypassing detection. Additionally, if `WinRAR.EXE` is utilized legitimately for file extraction and subsequently invokes benign child processes, it could generate false positives. Analysts should also consider the possibility that the alert may not cover newly introduced or unknown execution patterns that are not present in the detection criteria.

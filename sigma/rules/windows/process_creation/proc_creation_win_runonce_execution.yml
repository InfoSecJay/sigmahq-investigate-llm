  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Run Once Task Execution as Configured in Registry" is designed to identify the execution of tasks via the Windows Run Once feature, which allows for commands or scripts to run a single time at the next user login. The rule specifically monitors the process creation logs for executables that match the `runonce.exe` image path and then cross-references the command line parameters used during execution. In particular, it looks for instances where `runonce.exe` is executed with arguments such as `/AlternateShellStartup` or `/r`, which are indicative of potential misuse or abuse of this feature for executing unwanted scripts or payloads.
  This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Defense Evasion (Tactic: `Defense Evasion`, Technique: `T1112`), where adversaries may leverage legitimate Windows functionalities to evade detection and execute malicious payloads. The detection utilizes the Windows Process Creation logs provided by Sysmon to capture the relevant data for analysis, offering context for incident responders investigating alerts raised by this rule.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Start by examining the Sysmon process creation logs in your EDR tool to identify the time of the alert, the user account involved, and the parent process of the `runonce.exe` execution.
    
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command line arguments associated with the `runonce.exe` process, specifically looking for any unusual or unexpected entries that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Check for Persistence Routines:** Use your endpoint protection tools to check whether this execution correlates with any persistence mechanisms on the affected host, such as scheduled tasks or other registry entries.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Cross-reference the execution time of the `runonce.exe` with logs from the Windows Security Event Logs to determine if there were other concurrent user activities that might indicate legitimate usage or could suggest malicious behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of the detection, this alert is considered low severity as it flags tasks that are part of legitimate Windows functionality, but still may indicate potential misuse. However, thorough investigation is necessary to rule out hostile action.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if an adversary directly invokes the intended executable without utilizing the `runonce` mechanism, therefore evading detection. Additionally, the rule assumes that Sysmon is correctly configured and capturing relevant process creation events; failure to do so may lead to missed alerts. It is also worth noting that legitimate administrative activities may trigger this rule, necessitating careful contextual analysis to differentiate between benign and malicious attempts.

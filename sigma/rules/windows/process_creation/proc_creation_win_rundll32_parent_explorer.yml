title: Rundll32 Spawned Via Explorer.EXE
id: 1723e720-616d-4ddc-ab02-f7e3685a4713
status: test
description: Detects execution of "rundll32.exe" with a parent process of Explorer.exe.
  This has been observed by variants of Raspberry Robin, as first reported by Red
  Canary.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect instances where the `rundll32.exe` process is spawned by the `explorer.exe` process. The `rundll32.exe` executable is commonly used by attackers, including variants of Raspberry Robin, to load dynamic link libraries (DLLs) maliciously. The detection focuses on specific command-line parameters that indicate illegitimate use, notably those invoking the `-localserver` flag, which is typically associated with benign Windows operations. By observing process creation logs from Windows, particularly where `explorer.exe` is identified as the parent process, this rule aims to flag potentially malicious behaviors that deviate from normal usage patterns. This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically targeting techniques leveraging system binaries for executing harmful payloads.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate the Process Creation Logs:** Search for the alerting `rundll32.exe` execution in the Windows Event Logs (Process Creation) for additional context surrounding the process, including its full command-line arguments and timestamp.
  - **Analyze Parent-Child Relationships:** Utilize EDR tools to map out the process tree, verifying the legitimacy of `explorer.exe` as the parent and examining the child process behavior for indicators of compromise.
  - **Check for Anomalous Network Activity:** Employ the NDR to analyze outbound connections initiated by the `rundll32.exe` process during the time frame of the alert to identify any suspicious external communications.
  - **Run Antivirus/Anti-malware Scans:** Use your enterprise AV solution to scan the system for malware signatures and assess if any known threats are present that correspond with the detected activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity within the enterprise environment due to the potential for malicious code execution through a typically trusted process. It is essential to investigate promptly, as such behaviors may indicate an active compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the `rundll32.exe` process is launched with different parent processes or if command-line arguments vary significantly from those defined in the detection criteria. Additionally, if legitimate applications exploit `rundll32.exe` in a non-standard manner, it could lead to false negatives. It is assumed that all process creation logs are being collected and monitored effectively; however, if there are gaps in logging due to policy misconfigurations or if Windows event logging is disabled, the detection may not function as intended.

  ### Technical Context
  The "ConvertTo-SecureString Cmdlet Usage Via CommandLine" rule is designed to detect instances where the PowerShell cmdlet `ConvertTo-SecureString` is invoked via the command line. This behavior is considered suspicious because it is infrequently used in normal operational activities and might indicate an attempt to obfuscate the passing of sensitive information, such as credentials. The rule examines process creation logs from Windows operating systems, focusing on the PowerShell executable (`powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe`) and specific command-line arguments that contain the string `ConvertTo-SecureString`. By monitoring these activities, the rule helps identify potential defense evasion tactics employed by attackers within your enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
   
  Review the process creation logs in your EDR tool to identify any instances of `powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe` launching with the `ConvertTo-SecureString` command.
   
  Examine the command line parameters associated with the detected process to understand the context in which this cmdlet was used, focusing on any suspicious or unexpected parameters.
   
  Investigate nearby events in the SIEM, such as login attempts or lateral movement activities, to determine if the command execution correlates with other suspicious behavior.
   
  Check proxy and firewall logs for any unusual external communications originating from the host running the PowerShell command to assess potential data exfiltration or command and control activities.

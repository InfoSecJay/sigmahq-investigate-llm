  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious File Execution From Internet Hosted WebDav Share" is designed to detect potentially malicious activity involving the execution of commands that mount a WebDAV share and launch executable content from it. Specifically, it looks for the execution of the `net use` command to establish a connection to a remote WebDAV server, followed by attempts to execute files such as `.exe`, `.dll`, `.bat`, `.vbs`, or PowerShell scripts using the command line interface. The rule leverages process creation logs sourced from Windows, analyzing the command line parameters to identify suspicious patterns where malicious files may be executed directly from a network location, thereby indicating possible exploitation techniques as referenced in MITRE ATT&CK under tactic "Execution" (T1059.001).
  This behavior often correlates with tactics employed in phishing attacks, where malicious LNK files lead users to inadvertently execute harmful commands. The technical data utilized in this rule includes critical elements from process creation logs, focusing on the command line parameters utilized during the execution of `cmd.exe`, the original filename of executed processes, and the use of various file extensions indicative of script or executable files.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Identify Detected Activity:** Review the process creation logs in the SIEM to locate instances where `cmd.exe` was executed with the `net use` command along with the specific parameters that indicate a WebDAV connection.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check related logs including DNS queries and firewall logs for outbound connections made to the WebDAV server's IP, verifying whether the resources were accessed in conjunction with the identified command execution.
  - **Examine File Source:** Investigate the file path and attributes of any executed file for legitimacy, looking for unusual behaviors such as execution from locations that are not standard or expected within your environment.
  - **Review User Context:** Analyze the user account under which the commands were executed, assessing if it aligns with typical user behavior or if it appears anomalous, including any potential escalation of privileges.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the associated risks of executing files from potentially untrusted network locations, which can lead to malware infections, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Immediate investigation is warranted to prevent potential damage to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary uses alternate methods to execute commands, such as utilizing different command interpreters or obfuscating malicious intent. Furthermore, if the execution does not include any recognizable file types or the command line patterns deviate from the specified ones, the detection may fail. Additionally, environments with limited visibility on network shares or misuse of legitimate WebDAV functionality might also lead to missed detections.

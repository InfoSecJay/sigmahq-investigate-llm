  ### Technical Context
  The "Obfuscated IP Download Activity" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activities involving the download of content from URLs that include encoded or obfuscated versions of IP addresses. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs to monitor the command-line arguments of processes that invoke commands to download resources, such as `Invoke-WebRequest`, `wget`, `curl`, `DownloadFile`, or `DownloadString`. By analyzing the command-line input for certain patternsâ€”like hexadecimal, octal encodings, and other obfuscation techniques, it can capture suspicious behaviors often used by attackers to mask their intentions in command-line activities.
  When executing download commands that include obfuscated IP addresses, adversaries aim to bypass traditional security measures that inspect URLs for known threat indicators. This technique is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Discovery** (TA0007) and specifically addresses techniques such as **Command and Control** (T1071) which describes how adversaries can use various methods to establish command and control channels.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Context:** Use the EDR solution to investigate the parent-child process relationships for the triggering event, ensuring to identify if the download command was executed by a legitimate user or process.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line arguments captured in the process creation logs to determine if they exhibit further obfuscation techniques or match known malicious patterns.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Use NDR tools to analyze outgoing traffic from the affected endpoint. Look for connections to the downloaded URLs or additional suspicious external connections correlating with the alert.
  - **Review Security Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs (Security, Application) for any recent unusual activity from the user or process that triggered the alert, particularly focusing on elevation of privilege or unauthorized access attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this rule captures potentially malicious behavior that leverages obfuscated IP addresses within download commands, an alert should be treated with medium severity. Investigators should approach these alerts carefully, as they may indicate an attempt to establish a command-and-control channel or download further malicious payloads.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the adversary employs different obfuscation methods that do not fit the identified patterns in command-line arguments. Additionally, legitimate applications may perform operations that resemble malicious downloads but do not involve obfuscated IPs, leading to false positives. Analysts should be aware that sophisticated attackers could also leverage custom tools that bypass standard command usage or use native Windows tools configured in a non-standard manner.

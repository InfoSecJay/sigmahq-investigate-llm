  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule targets the execution of the Windows Problem Steps Recorder (psr.exe), a tool that records user screen activity and actions, which can be misused by attackers to capture sensitive information during reconnaissance or data exfiltration phases. The detection mechanism relies on process creation logs that identify when csn.exe is executed, specifically looking for command-line parameters like '/start' or '-start', indicating the initiation of screen capture functionality. By leveraging telemetry data from tools such as Sysmon and Windows Event Logs, responders can correlate psr.exe activity with user behavior and potential malicious intent. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1113 
  - Screen Capture, which highlights the importance of monitoring tools capable of collecting sensitive user information without permission.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:** Examine the EDR for any instances of psr.exe execution, and correlate with user accounts. Check if this execution is consistent with legitimate user activity or if it deviates from established patterns.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line arguments logged with the psr.exe execution to confirm that no malicious parameters are being utilized that could indicate misuse or automation of the screen capture process.
  - **Analyze User Context:** Utilize Windows Security logs to identify the user context under which psr.exe was executed. Investigate whether the user has a history of normal system usage or if this execution is anomalous relative to their behaviors.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Investigate any accompanying network connections or outbound activity recorded during the time psr.exe was executed. This can help ascertain if captured data was potentially sent to an external IP address.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity due to the potential for misuse of the screen capture functionality, which could allow attackers to capture sensitive information. While not a definitive indicator of compromise, its presence warrants timely investigation, especially in high-security environments.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses alternative methods or tools for screen capture that do not involve psr.exe or if the execution is obfuscated using custom parameters. Additionally, if psr.exe is executed under legitimate scenarios, such as user training or troubleshooting, it may lead to false positives. Responders should also be aware that advanced attackers may use different processes or clear logs afterward, making detection more challenging.

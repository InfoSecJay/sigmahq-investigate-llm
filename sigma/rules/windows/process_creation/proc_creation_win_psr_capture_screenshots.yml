  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Screen Capture Activity Via Psr.EXE" focuses on detecting the execution of the Windows Problem Steps Recorder (psr.exe), a utility designed to capture screen activity and user interactions. This utility can be leveraged for both legitimate purposes, such as troubleshooting, and malicious activities, including unauthorized screen capturing or data exfiltration. The rule primarily inspects process creation logs for instances where the image name ends with 'Psr.exe' along with specific command-line parameters that indicate the utility is being initiated to start capturing activities (e.g., '/start' or '-start'). Analysts can utilize this detection to quickly identify potential misuse of the utility as part of a broader security posture.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the logs in the EDR solution to look for the process creation events associated with 'Psr.exe' and the respective command-line arguments to confirm the alert details.
  - Analyze any related user activity logs to determine the context of the execution, including the user account, time of execution, and any unusual patterns that may indicate malicious intention.
  - Check network logs for any outbound connections made by the same user during or shortly after the execution of 'Psr.exe' that might suggest data exfiltration efforts.
  - Investigate the workstation's environment for any other indicators of compromise, such as the presence of unauthorized software or abnormal user behavior, to establish whether this execution was part of a larger attack.

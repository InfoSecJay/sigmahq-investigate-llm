  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies potential data exfiltration or unauthorized remote access attempts involving Chromium-based web browsers when they are launched in headless mode with remote debugging enabled. The rule targets abnormal command-line parameters, specifically the presence of "--remote-debugging-", "--user-data-dir", and "--headless", which can indicate that the browser is being used to access user profiles and session data without the user's knowledge. By monitoring the `process_creation` logs, this detection seeks to capture any activity that matches these patterns, enabling analysts to mitigate risks associated with credential access and unauthorized operations. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Tactic of Credential Access (T1185).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Investigate the Process Creation Logs**: Use your EDR to review process creation logs around the time of the alert. Look for browser processes initiated with the detected command-line parameters.
    
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic**: Check the network connection logs to identify any outbound connections made by the browser that is suspected of running in headless mode. Focus on any unusual or unauthorized data transmissions.
  - **Assess User Profiles Used**: Query the directories specified by the `--user-data-dir` argument to examine the user profiles that are potentially being accessed. Investigate any unusual activity or files that may indicate data theft.
  - **Check for Additional Artifacts**: Look into the Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs for any related events, such as registry modifications or logs of files accessed by the browser. This could provide further insights into the intent and actions of the process.
  ### Prioritization
  Given its potential for credential access and data theft, this alert is classified as high severity. Immediate attention is required to understand the context of the behavior and mitigate possible risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the command-line parameters are altered or if the attacked user profile is not logged or monitored properly. Adversaries could also employ obfuscation techniques or modifications that mask their intentions. Furthermore, legitimate usage of remote debugging by applications not accounted for could result in false positives, necessitating careful context evaluation.

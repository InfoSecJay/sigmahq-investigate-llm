  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the Dumpert tool, a malicious utility known for its ability to dump the memory of the `lsass.exe` process. `lsass.exe` (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is critical in managing security policies and handling authentication on Windows systems. When Dumpert is executed, it allows attackers to extract sensitive credential information from memory, posing a significant security threat. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs to identify specific indicators: the unique MD5 hash associated with Dumpert and command-line parameters that include references to `Dumpert.dll`. By monitoring these signals, the rule effectively correlates the usage of known malicious software with the action of credential theft.
  This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Credential Access (TA0006) and the technique of Credential Dumping (T1003.001), which emphasizes the importance of monitoring for unauthorized access and the potential exfiltration of sensitive information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Recent Process Activity:** Utilize your EDR to analyze process creation logs for the identified hash value or command-line parameter to track the execution event of Dumpert and any subsequent actions on the system.
  - **Assess Associated Processes:** Investigate other processes that may have been initiated around the same time as the Dumpert execution. This may reveal lateral movement or other attack vectors.
  - **Analyze Memory Dump Files:** If possible, capture and analyze the memory dump to determine whether any sensitive credentials or other compromised information have been extracted.
  - **Conduct Network Traffic Analysis:** Check logs from your NDR for any unusual outbound connections made by the suspected host following the execution of Dumpert, which could indicate data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered critical due to the potential for severe security consequences associated with credential theft. Compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to critical systems and sensitive data, emphasizing the need for immediate investigation and response.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire if the Dumpert tool is executed from a modified hash not covered within the rule or if a skilled adversary employs obfuscation techniques to disguise the command line. It is also presumed that the environment is adequately logging process creation details; if logging is inadequate or misconfigured, the rule may be ineffective. Furthermore, if Dumpert is executed in a way that alters its behavior or through a different entry point that does not utilize standard process creation logs, it may go undetected.

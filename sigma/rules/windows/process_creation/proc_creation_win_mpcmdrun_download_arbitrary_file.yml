  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential malicious behavior associated with the misuse of the Windows Defender's `MpCmdRun.exe`, specifically targeting its capability to download files from the internet. The rule monitors for process creation events of `MpCmdRun.exe` and analyzes the command-line parameters to recognize specific commands like `DownloadFile` paired with a URL. Such actions can be indicative of attempts to use a legitimate security tool to circumvent security defenses, thereby aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for defense evasion (T1218) and command and control (T1105). The relevant telemetry is sourced from Windows Process Creation logs, where key attributes, such as the executable name and command-line parameters, are examined.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution to confirm the execution of `MpCmdRun.exe` and capture related command-line arguments.
    
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Utilize the network detection and response (NDR) tools to check for outbound connections made during the time frame of the file download, particularly matching the URLs noted in the command line.
  - **Review Antivirus Logs:** Cross-reference any alerts or logs from your antivirus solution for indications of any files that may have been downloaded and subsequently scanned, looking for potentially malicious indicators.
  - **Inspect System Logs:** Examine the Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application) associated with the time of the download to gather additional context, such as user activity and system changes.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert signals potential misuse of a legitimate Windows tool to download files, it is critical to investigate promptly, as this behavior often serves as a precursor to further malicious activity within the environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `MpCmdRun.exe` is executed without the `DownloadFile` command or if executed with a command that does not include a valid URL. Additionally, in environments with restrictive outbound web controls or where network monitoring is insufficient, detection may be hindered. Adversaries can also subvert this detection by executing similar patterns with altered command syntax or through other processes, which could remain unnoticed.

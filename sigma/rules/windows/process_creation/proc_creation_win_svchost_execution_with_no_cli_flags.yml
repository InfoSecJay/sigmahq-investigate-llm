title: Suspect Svchost Activity
id: 16c37b52-b141-42a5-a3ea-bbe098444397
status: test
description: It is extremely abnormal for svchost.exe to spawn without any CLI arguments
  and is normally observed when a malicious process spawns the process and injects
  code into the process memory space.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspect Svchost Activity" is designed to detect abnormal behavior associated with the Windows system process "svchost.exe." Typically, "svchost.exe" serves as a generic host process for services that run from dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). However, it becomes suspicious when this process is spawned without any command-line arguments, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The absence of command-line arguments may suggest that malicious code is injected into the memory space of "svchost.exe," often executed by another process like "rpcnet.exe" or "rpcnetp.exe." This behavior is particularly noteworthy in the context of privilege escalation and defense evasion tactics (MITRE ATT&CK tactic: Defense Evasion, technique: T1055). The primary data sources leveraged by this rule include process creation logs and associated command-line parameters.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Alert Details**: Review the alert to confirm the process tree, paying particular attention to the parent process of "svchost.exe." Anomalous parent processes should prompt deeper investigation.
  - **Examine EDR Data**: Utilize EDR tools to explore the specific "svchost.exe" instance. Look for any injections, unusual network activity, or modifications leading to unauthorized access.
  - **Correlate with Security Logs**: Investigate Windows Security logs for events related to the execution of "svchost.exe," specifically checking for any authentication anomalies or privilege escalations around the time of the alert.
  - **Review Application Behavior**: If "rpcnet.exe" or "rpcnetp.exe" are present, cross-reference against known benign signatures or documented behavior (e.g., lojack software) to determine if they are legitimate or likely part of malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be treated with high priority, as the detection of "svchost.exe" running without command-line arguments could indicate a compromised host, suggesting the presence of advanced malware or a potential data breach. Immediate investigation is essential to mitigate any risks associated with privilege escalation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot is that legitimate applications, such as lojack software (e.g., "rpcnet.exe" or "rpcnetp.exe"), might be falsely flagged by this rule, leading to potential alert fatigue among analysts. Additionally, adversaries may use techniques to disguise their malicious activity, such as modifying the command-line arguments of processes or using alternative parent processes. There is an assumption that all notable instances of "svchost.exe" should include command-line arguments, yet legitimate subprocess launches may not always follow this convention. Security teams should continuously update the rule database to account for new legitimate behaviors or potential evasion techniques.

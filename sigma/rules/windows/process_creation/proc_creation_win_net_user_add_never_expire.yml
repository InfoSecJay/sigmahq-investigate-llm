  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the creation of local user accounts in Windows environments using the `net.exe` command-line utility with the specific option to set the account as "never expire." The rule monitors process creation logs and looks for instances where the command-line parameters include both `user`, `add`, and `expires:never`. The rule specifically targets instances of `net.exe` and `net1.exe`, catching operations that could signify unauthorized user account creation, particularly relevant in cases of lateral movement by attackers or insider threats. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of `Persistence` and the technique `Account Manipulation (T1136.001)`, highlighting its relevance to maintaining unauthorized access within system environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify User Creation:** Check the Windows Security Event Logs for corresponding event IDs (e.g., 4720) that confirm the creation of the new user and correlate the timestamps with the detected `net.exe` execution.
  - **Analyze Process Details:** Query EDR tool for details on the `net.exe` process, including its parent process and any associated command-line arguments to understand the context of the user account creation.
  - **Check for Anomalous Behavior:** Review logs on system login events or unusual user activity for the newly created account to ascertain whether it has been used for legitimate purposes or malicious activity.
  - **Review Account Policies:** Investigate local security policies or group policies to ensure they align with organizational standards regarding user account expiration and permissions which can help identify potential compliance violations.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the severity level of high for this alert, it indicates a significant risk to the organization, potentially pointing to misuse of administrative privileges for account creation, which can lead to unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the attacker uses different methods for account creation (e.g., through PowerShell instead of `net.exe`) or mimics legitimate processes to evade detection. Additionally, if system auditing is not configured properly to capture detailed process creation logs, this could result in missed alerts. Engineers should also consider that configurations allowing `net.exe` usage for legitimate purposes may generate false negatives if misconfigured.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify unauthorized mounting of administrative shares using the `net.exe` command in Windows environments. When an administrator shares a resource on a network, it can be exploited by attackers to access files and services without direct authorization. This rule inspects process creation logs for instances where the `net.exe` or `net1.exe` executables run with command-line parameters indicating that a share is being accessed or created (e.g., 'use' command followed by a UNC path). The technical data sources leveraged for detection encompass process creation logs, enabling the SOC team to gain insights into suspicious behavior and assess potential lateral movement within the network. This rule is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactic of lateral movement, specifically technique T1021.002, which targets administrative shares.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Activity:** Investigate the process creation logs in the EDR platform for instances of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` execution to understand the context of the activity.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Analyze command-line parameters associated with the detected processes to determine if they indicate usage of shared resources or malicious intent.
  - **Audit Network Connections:** Inspect network logs to identify any connections established to shared folders or services on remote systems that align with the suspicious mount action.
  - **Assess User Accounts and Roles:** Examine the user account associated with the activity, checking for any unauthorized access or unusual permissions that may indicate a breach.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has a medium severity level due to the potential for administrative share exploitation, which can pose substantial risks if an unauthorized user gains access to sensitive resources within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `net.exe` is executed without the specified command-line signatures, or if legitimate administrative activity takes place without malicious intent. Furthermore, if attackers leverage other command-line tools or techniques to achieve similar outcomes, such as using PowerShell or different utilities, this rule may not capture those situations. The assumption is made that the logging levels for process creation are appropriately configured and that access to these logs is uninterrupted.

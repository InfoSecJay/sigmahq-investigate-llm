  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on monitoring the usage of the SQLite binary files (`sqlite.exe` or `sqlite3.exe`) within Windows operating systems, specifically when querying databases associated with Mozilla Firefox and other Gecko-based browsers. The rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or unauthorized access to sensitive user data stored in files like `cookies.sqlite` and `places.sqlite`, which can include cookies, bookmarks, and browsing history. It leverages the process creation logs of Windows, analyzing the command-line parameters associated with these SQLite executables to flag suspicious activity.
  By targeting the `Credential Access` and `Collection` tactics from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the rule helps SOC analysts detect attempts to misuse SQLite for unauthorized data access. If an alert is triggered, it indicates that the SQLite binary was executed with command-line arguments aimed at querying Firefox's database files, which can be suggestive of credential harvesting or other malicious data collection initiatives.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your SIEM to confirm the execution of `sqlite.exe` or `sqlite3.exe`. Correlate the timestamps with other user activities to understand the context of the execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters associated with the detected SQLite process to determine if they include references to `cookies.sqlite` or `places.sqlite`. This can provide crucial context regarding the intent of the process.
  - **Examine User Account Activity:** Use EDR tools to analyze the user account involved in the alert. Assess the user’s recent activities and behaviors, including login patterns and any abnormal account actions that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Evaluate Network Traffic:** Check the network traffic logs for any suspicious outbound connections that correspond with the timing of the SQLite usage. Look for data exfiltration patterns, such as connections to unrecognized IP addresses or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because the misuse of SQLite for scraping data from browser databases can lead to significant privacy breaches and reveal sensitive user information, potentially impacting enterprise security posture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if the SQLite binaries are executed with altered names or if the querying is conducted through alternative methods, such as code injection or through other benign applications. Additionally, if an attacker uses a legitimate account with privileged access, it may evade detection. There is also an assumption that all relevant process creation logs are being captured appropriately—any gaps in logging could hinder the visibility needed to catch such activity.

  ### Technical Context
  The "User Added To Highly Privileged Group" detection rule is designed to monitor and identify potentially unauthorized modifications to user group memberships within a Windows environment. Specifically, the rule captures instances where users are added to highly privileged groups, such as "Group Policy Creator Owners" or "Schema Admins." It does this by monitoring process creation events for specific command-line activities, particularly those involving `net.exe` and PowerShell commands (`Add-LocalGroupMember`). By correlating command-line parameters with the known syntax for adding users to these significant groups, the rule aids in detecting attempted privilege escalation or potentially malicious administrative actions. This rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1098 (Account Manipulation), emphasizing the adversaryâ€™s efforts to establish persistence through elevated access privileges.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Logs:** Examine Windows Security event logs for event IDs related to group membership changes (e.g., 4728 for adding a member to a group) around the time of the alert to confirm the action.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check the user's recent activities in EDR for any unusual behavior, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  - **Validate Authorization:** Confirm with your IT or admin team whether the addition was authorized and aligns with organizational policy; legitimate administrative actions can generate similar alerts.
  - **Investigate Source Command:** Investigate the source of the command execution by checking process creation events in Sysmon to determine if this was initiated from a legitimate administrative tool or possibly a compromised system.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high priority due to the potential risk of privilege escalation; unauthorized additions to highly privileged groups can lead to significant security breaches, making it imperative to investigate promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the accuracy of logging from Windows event sources and assumes that all privilege changes will generate corresponding logs. It may not fire if logging is disabled or misconfigured. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions by authorized personnel could result in false positives. Adversaries may also leverage obfuscation techniques to bypass detection, for example, using alternative methods to alter group memberships that do not trigger traditional logging mechanisms.

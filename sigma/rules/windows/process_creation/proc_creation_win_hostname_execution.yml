  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Execution of Hostname" Sigma rule is designed to detect instances when the `hostname.exe` executable is run on a Windows system. This executable is commonly utilized for discovering the hostname of the local machine, but its execution can be indicative of potential reconnaissance activities by malicious actors. The rule specifically looks for process creation logs where the image name ends with `HOSTNAME.EXE`. The detection utilizes Windows Process Creation logs as its primary data source, enabling security analysts to identify unusual behaviors involving hostname retrieval that may signal unauthorized information gathering or internal reconnaissance efforts.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically addressing the `Discovery` tactic (T1082 
  - System Information Discovery). By monitoring for this specific executable, organizations can gain insights into potential irregularities that could assist in identifying broader threats, especially in environments where sensitive information resides.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution for additional context around the execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, including parent processes and command-line arguments. Look for unusual or unfamiliar parent processes that could indicate malicious activity.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate user activity logs to determine which account executed `HOSTNAME.EXE` and if it aligns with the typical behavior of that user. For example, verify if the user has legitimate reasons to run this executable recently.
  - **Search for Anomalous Network Activity:** Utilize your NDR and firewall logs to check for outbound connections initiated shortly after the execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`. This can help establish if there was any data exfiltration or communication with suspicious external hosts.
  - **Review Other Related Logs:** Analyze application and system event logs for additional context around the time the process was initiated. Focus on any other security events that could relate to suspicious behavior following the execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is flagged with a low severity level due to the nature of the detected activity, as the execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` can often occur in legitimate situations. However, the context of the environment and the user behavior should be taken into consideration, as it can still represent a preliminary step in a reconnaissance attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where adversaries use alternative methods or commands for hostname discovery that do not involve executing `HOSTNAME.EXE`. Additionally, the presence of legitimate administrative scripts or automation tools that also call this executable could lead to false negatives. It is assumed that logging for process creation events is consistently enabled and not filtered or restricted, which could disable visibility for this rule.

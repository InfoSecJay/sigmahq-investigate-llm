  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the invocation of `certutil.exe` with the `-encode` flag, a command used to encode files as Base64. `Certutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line utility included in Windows for certificate handling, but it can also be exploited by threat actors for nefarious purposes, such as data exfiltration. The rule primarily analyzes process creation logs for instances where `certutil.exe` is run with the specified command-line parameters. These command-line parameters are crucial as they indicate an attempt to encode a file in a potentially malicious manner. This behavior is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1027), which covers techniques used by adversaries to evade detection and achieve their objectives.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize the EDR to examine the process creation logs corresponding to the event, focusing on the instance where `certutil.exe` was executed with the `-encode` argument.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Check the specific files that were encoded by inspecting the command line parameters. Look for any indicators of sensitive data or unusual filenames.
  - **Correlate with Data Exfiltration Activities**: Use network logs and proxy data to identify if the encoded file was later transferred to external destinations, indicating potential data exfiltration.
  - **Examine User Context**: Investigate the user account that executed the command to determine if the action matches the user's expected behavior or if it deviates from the norm.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity as the encoding of files via `certutil.exe` can indicate potential data exfiltration or misuse of legitimate tools, necessitating closer scrutiny of the actions and context surrounding the event.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where monitoring of process creation is not enabled or if `certutil.exe` is not utilized frequently, leading to missed detections. Additionally, adversaries may use obfuscation techniques or alternative encoding methods to bypass this detection. It's also important to consider legitimate administrative tasks that may trigger similar alerts, highlighting the need for contextual analysis during investigations.

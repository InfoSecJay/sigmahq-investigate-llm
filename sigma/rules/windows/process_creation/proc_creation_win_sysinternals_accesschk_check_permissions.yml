  ### Technical Context
  The "Permission Check Via Accesschk.EXE" Sigma rule focuses on detecting the execution of `Accesschk`, a utility developed by SysInternals for auditing access controls and privileges in Windows environments. The rule looks for process creation events associated with `Accesschk` binaries—namely `accesschk.exe` and `accesschk64.exe`—and identifies specific command-line arguments commonly used in privilege verification. This detection primarily uses Windows process creation logs (such as from Sysmon) to pinpoint the use of this tool, which can indicate malicious activity when leveraged by an attacker to identify potential privilege escalation paths. By examining both the product name and the command-line parameters, the rule can differentiate legitimate administrative usage from potentially harmful interactions that may signify reconnaissance efforts in line with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Discovery, Technique T1069.001.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Logs:** Utilize the EDR solution to review process creation logs for instances where `accesschk.exe` or `accesschk64.exe` was executed. Focus on timestamps and user accounts associated with these executions.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command-line parameters used with `Accesschk`. Certain flags may indicate malicious intent, while others may be typical for system administrators. 
  - **User Behavior Analysis:** Use user behavior analytics tools to assess the activity of the user account in question. Look for unusual patterns or behaviors surrounding the time of the alert.
  - **Correlate with Credential Access:** Review Windows Event Logs and Sysmon activity for any subsequent events indicative of credential access or privilege escalation attempts after `Accesschk` execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential association of `Accesschk` abuse with malicious privilege escalation attempts. While legitimate users may utilize the tool for administrative purposes, its detection warrants further investigation to rule out any malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule assumes the presence of sufficient logging to capture process creation events, which may not be enabled in all environments. It may fail to fire if an attacker uses renamed binaries or invokes the functionality without executing `Accesschk` directly, such as creating scripts that leverage its capabilities silently. Additionally, there may be instances where legitimate system administrators utilize `Accesschk`, introducing false positives that need validation.

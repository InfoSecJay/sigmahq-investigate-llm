  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious Usage Of Active Directory Diagnostic Tool (ntdsutil.exe)" is designed to detect potentially malicious behavior associated with the execution of the `ntdsutil.exe` tool in a Windows environment. `ntdsutil.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft utility used for managing Active Directory. However, it can also be misused by attackers to restore snapshots or manipulate Active Directory data. This rule specifically focuses on monitoring the process creation events related to `ntdsutil.exe`, particularly when the command line includes parameters like 'snapshot' and 'mount'. The monitoring relies on data sources such as Windows Security Event Logs (specifically process creation logs) to identify suspicious usage patterns. The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of credential access and technique T1003.003, which concerns password extraction from Active Directory.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Examine `Windows Event Logs` under the Security category for process creation events related to `ntdsutil.exe`. This will provide context about when and how the tool was executed.
  - **Review Command Line Parameters**: Analyze the command line arguments associated with any identified instances of `ntdsutil.exe`, focusing on specific terms such as 'snapshot' and 'mount' to determine the exact nature of the operation.
  - **Correlate with User Accounts**: Investigate the user accounts that executed the command to establish whether the activity was done by legitimate administrative accounts or if there is a possibility of compromised credentials being used.
  - **Cross-reference with Active Directory Logs**: Utilize Active Directory logs to identify changes made during the time `ntdsutil.exe` was executed. This can help in understanding any unauthorized modifications to directory data.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for compromise and misuse of Active Directory functionalities, which could lead to further attacks if exploited. While legitimate administrative activity might trigger this rule, the impact of unauthorized access can be significant.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where legitimate usage of `ntdsutil.exe` is common, such as in extensive Active Directory management practices. Additionally, if an attacker uses a different tool or method for accessing Active Directory services, this rule may fail to fire. It assumes that the correct logging is enabled and available for analysis, which may not always be the case, particularly in environments that restrict logging levels or where logs are not centralized.

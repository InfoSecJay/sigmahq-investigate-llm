  ### Technical Context
  The "Port Forwarding Activity Via SSH.EXE" detection rule is designed to identify suspicious activity that uses SSH (Secure Shell) for port forwarding on Windows systems. This rule specifically looks for instances where the SSH executable (ssh.exe) is executed with command line parameters that include '-R', which indicates reverse port forwarding. Reverse port forwarding can be leveraged by an attacker to create a tunnel to a vulnerable internal system, allowing them to connect back to it from an external location. The primary data source for this detection is process creation logs, which capture details about processes initiated on the system, including the command line used for their execution. This aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques related to Command and Control (T1572) and Lateral Movement (T1021.001, T1021.004).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check EDR logs for the execution of `ssh.exe` and examine the command-line arguments for suspicious port forwarding options such as `-R`.
  - **Identify Network Connections:** Utilize network connection logs to determine if any unusual outbound connections are initiated during or after the `ssh.exe` execution.
  - **Review User Activity:** Look into Windows Security logs to verify the identity of the user who executed the command and review their previous activities for any suspicious behavior.
  - **Audit SSH Configuration:** Investigate any SSH configurations or permissions that might allow unauthorized access, focusing on whether known malicious IP addresses are involved.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because while SSH can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, unauthorized port forwarding can indicate an active security breach or potential lateral movement within the network. The presence of this activity warrants immediate investigation to determine the legitimacy of the access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger if an attacker disguises malicious activity using non-standard SSH implementations or by altering command-line syntax. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities, particularly by knowledgeable users familiar with SSH capabilities, could produce false positives. The assumption that outbound connections over SSH are malicious may lead to overlooking benign uses in trusted environments, thereby necessitating a contextual understanding of user roles and permissions.

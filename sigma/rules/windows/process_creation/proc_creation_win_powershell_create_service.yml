  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of a new Windows service using PowerShell, which may indicate an attempt at persistence by an adversary (MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1543.003). The rule specifically looks for PowerShell command invocations that include the `New-Service` cmdlet alongside the `-BinaryPathName` parameter. Monitoring is achieved primarily through process creation logs, allowing for the identification of potentially suspicious command-line activities that could signify an malicious action aimed at maintaining persistence on the host. Given the elevated privileges commonly required to create services, its usage can also indicate potential privilege escalation actions by an attacker.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze recent process creation logs for any instances of the PowerShell process executing with the detected `New-Service` command and associated parameters.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments**: Inspect the full command-line arguments of the PowerShell invocation to identify any unusual or unexpected paths that could be associated with malicious activity.
  - **Check Service Configuration**: Examine the created serviceâ€™s properties through the Windows Service Control Manager to ascertain its configuration, startup type, and the binary it points to for any signs of nefarious intent.
  - **Correlate with User Activities**: Assess Windows Event Logs, particularly security logs, to correlate the service creation event with user actions and recent administrative logins to determine legitimacy or potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts stemming from this rule should be given moderate consideration due to the potential implications of unauthorized service creation, which may provide attackers the means for persistent access or privilege escalation, necessitating prompt investigative action.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not capture scenarios where services are created using other legitimate methods, such as the `sc.exe` command, which is a similar but unrelated approach. Additionally, the rule may miss occurrences where services are created in a legitimate manner by authorized users or administrators (false positives). Furthermore, if PowerShell is disabled or restricted on a host, the rule will not fire, creating a potential window for adversaries who may utilize alternative means for persistence.

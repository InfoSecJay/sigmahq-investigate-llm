  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Tamper Windows Defender Remove-MpPreference" is designed to detect suspicious activity where an adversary may attempt to tamper with Windows Defender configurations using the PowerShell cmdlet `Remove-MpPreference`. Specifically, the rule looks for process creation events that contain certain command lines indicative of attempts to modify security settings that protect the system from malware, such as Controlled Folder Access protections and Attack Surface Reduction rules. By monitoring the `CommandLine` parameter within process creation logs, the rule aims to identify the potential misuse of administrative tools that could be leveraged by attackers to evade detection or disable critical security mechanisms. This activity is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Defense Evasion" and technique "T1562.001: Disable or Adjust Security Tools."
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Utilize EDR solutions to filter process creation logs for instances of `Remove-MpPreference`. Pay close attention to the timestamp and user context to determine whether this action is authorized.
    
  - **Correlate with User Activity Logs:** Investigate related user activities around the time of the alert using Windows Security logs. Determine if the user has the appropriate administrative rights and whether their account was subject to any anomalies or potential compromise.
    
  - **Analyze PowerShell Command Usage:** Check for any recent or unusual use of PowerShell, particularly commands involving security configurations, by utilizing Sysmon logs. Look for patterns indicating automated scripts or repeated executions.
    
  - **Examine Endpoint Security Settings:** Verify the current Windows Defender configuration to see if any settings have been modified by the detected command. Cross-reference with documented security policies to assess compliance.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is high due to the potential impact of tampering with Windows Defender settings, which could allow malware or unauthorized software to operate undetected. Quick response is essential to mitigate risks associated with security tool manipulation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule might not trigger in the following scenarios: 
  - If the `Remove-MpPreference` command is run with different parameters or within legitimate administrative contexts, it may not raise an alert.
  - Legitimate administrative actions that result in the same command execution could lead to false positives, especially in environments where PowerShell is widely used for standard operations.
  - If logging is improperly configured or certain administrative actions are excluded from telemetry, the rule may fail to fire altogether.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Add Potential Suspicious New Download Source To Winget" is designed to identify potentially malicious or unauthorized usage of the Windows Package Manager, `winget.exe`. The rule focuses on the command-line arguments of the `winget` process to detect when a user attempts to add a new source for downloadable packages, particularly those that may point to suspicious or unexpected IP addresses. This activity is analyzed through process creation logs, specifically monitoring the command-line parameters passed during the execution of `winget.exe`. The detection leverages patterns recognized in command-line inputs, looking for keywords such as "source" and "add," as well as regex to catch dynamic IP addresses that could signify an unsafe source. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of **Defense Evasion** and **Execution** (T1059 
  - Command and Scripting Interpreter).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs, filtering for instances where `winget.exe` is invoked with the command-line parameters indicative of adding a new package source.
    
  - **Review Network Connections:** Analyze network activities associated with the timestamps of the suspicious `winget` invocations. Use the NDR tool to detect if there are any unexpected connections to external IP addresses during that time frame.
  - **Inspect System Policies:** Verify Group Policies and restrictions set on package management sources to ensure that the modified configurations align with the organization's policies and that no unauthorized changes exist.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Look into the user accounts executing the commands to determine if they have legitimate reasons for adding new sources to `winget`, considering their roles and access rights within the organization.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with adding untrusted software sources, which could lead to software supply chain attacks or unauthorized software installations within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in the event that the `winget` command is executed without the specific patterns targeted by the detection logic (e.g., using different command-line arguments). Additionally, if an adversary uses techniques to obfuscate their command or employs a whitelisted source, it may bypass detection. There is also an assumption that monitoring is adequately implemented, and environments with restricted internet access may not see relevant alerts.

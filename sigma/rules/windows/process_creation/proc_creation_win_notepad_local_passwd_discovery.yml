  ### Technical Context
  The "Notepad Password Files Discovery" detection rule is designed to identify potential unauthorized access to sensitive credential files by monitoring the execution of Notepad with specific command-line parameters. The rule focuses on instances where Notepad is opened to view files whose names contain the string "password" and have extensions such as `.txt`, `.csv`, `.doc`, or `.xls`. It utilizes Windows Sysmon process creation logs to capture relevant details about the parent process (e.g., `explorer.exe`), which starts Notepad, and tracks any unusual or potentially harmful behavior indicative of credential harvesting or exposure. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Discovery** and specifically targets the technique **T1083 
  - File and Directory Discovery**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR to filter process creation events for instances where Notepad was launched to view files containing "password". Focus particularly on the command-line arguments used.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check the user's activity and access logs prior to the event to identify if the user had legitimate reasons to access such files, which could mitigate the incident.
  - **Analyze File Accessed:** Investigate the actual files that were accessed by Notepad for any sensitive information to determine if they contain credentials that should not be exposed.
  - **Evaluate Security Policies:** Review organizational policies on password storage to ascertain if the user violated any policies by accessing or creating files that could compromise security.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is categorized as low because the detection points to possible risk from potentially legitimate administrative activities. However, any discovery-related findings of files containing sensitive information warrant closer scrutiny as they may indicate policy violations or risky user behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if users access password files through methods other than Notepad or if malware processes do not mimic this common usage pattern. It assumes that the specific naming convention and extensions are consistently employed, meaning other methods or formats for storing passwords may bypass detection. Additionally, if users are trained to hide such files using alternative names or locations, detection may fail, providing an adversary a means to circumvent this investigation.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed FTP.EXE Execution" rule detects attempts to run a potentially malicious renamed version of the standard FTP client, `ftp.exe`, based on the Portable Executable (PE) metadata fields in Windows process creation logs. Specifically, the rule looks for instances where a process is executed with the original file name `ftp.exe`, but the actual executable image has a different path or name. This behavior is often associated with defense evasion tactics, where adversaries rename common binaries to disguise malicious activity. The data sources involved in this detection include Windows Sysmon logs for process creation which provide insights into the original file name, image path, and command-line parameters used when launching the process. This rule relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for execution (T1202) and defense evasion (T1059).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Review Windows Sysmon process creation logs for entries matching the `ftp.exe` process where the `OriginalFileName` field corresponds to 'ftp.exe' but the `Image` path differs.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Investigate the `CommandLine` field of the alert to identify any suspicious parameters or payloads that may indicate malicious intentions.
  - **Inspect Parent Process**: Validate the `ParentImage` associated with the execution of `ftp.exe` to discern whether it is part of a legitimate process or possibly being leveraged by known malicious activities.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Utilize network logs from EDR or NDR tools to ascertain any unusual outbound FTP connections or data transfers related to the process in question, which could indicate potential data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because malicious use of a renamed `ftp.exe` could indicate an evolving attack mechanism. While it may not typically indicate immediate compromise, it still warrants prompt investigation to rule out potential threats.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in scenarios where the malicious binary is not named `ftp.exe`, or if the attacker uses a legitimate instance of the FTP client without renaming it. Additionally, variations in the environment or settings might lead to false negatives if the binary is executed without standard telemetry being logged. It assumes that Sysmon is properly deployed and configured to log detailed process creation events.

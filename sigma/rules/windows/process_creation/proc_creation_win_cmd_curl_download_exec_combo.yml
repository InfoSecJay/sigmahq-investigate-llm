  ### Technical Context
  The "Curl Download And Execute Combination" rule monitors for the use of the `curl` command line tool, which is commonly utilized by adversaries to download and execute malicious payloads from remote locations. This rule specifically looks for command-line arguments that indicate the use of `curl` in a potentially malicious manner, such as those containing `-o`, which specifies an output file, and other parameters that suggest the execution of downloaded content. The detection leverages process creation logs sourced from Windows environments, specifically focusing on the command-line activity of applications. This behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution) and T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) within the defense evasion and command and control tactics, respectively.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation events in EDR for instances where `curl.exe` was invoked, paying particular attention to the command-line parameters used, looking for patterns indicative of suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Check network traffic logs for external connections initiated by the endpoints where the alert triggered, focusing on connections to suspicious or known malicious domains.
  - **Investigate Downloaded Files:** Identify any files downloaded through the `curl` command by correlating the output filenames from the command line with file creation events, ensuring to analyze their contents for potential threats.
  - **Cross-Reference with Security Tools:** Conduct a search in AV and EDR tools for any flagged behavior associated with the downloaded files or the use of `curl`, determining whether prior incidents may be linked to the current alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the potential for serious security breaches; successful execution of this technique could allow an attacker to gain a foothold in the network through downloaded malware or other harmful payloads.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `curl` usage is legitimate, such as internal scripts or automation tasks. Additionally, if adversaries obfuscate their command lines or utilize alternative tools for downloading payloads, the detection may be bypassed. Analysts should consider the context of `curl` usage and possibly refine detection patterns to avoid false positives from legitimate operational activities.

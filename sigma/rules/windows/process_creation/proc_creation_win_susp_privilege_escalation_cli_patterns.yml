  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious RunAs-Like Flag Combination" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activities involving the execution of commands with elevated privileges using suspicious command line arguments. Specifically, the rule identifies instances where command-line operations are being executed with user-switch options (like `-u` or `--user`) targeting high-privilege accounts such as "system" or "administrator". The specified command line parameters also include the common execution commands like `cmd`, `powershell`, `whoami`, `wscript`, and `cscript`. 
  This detection relies primarily on process creation logs from Windows environments, particularly leveraging Sysmon data, which provides detailed account of command-line arguments associated with each process initiated on the system. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactic of Privilege Escalation (TA0004) and the technique of (T1068) "Exploitation of Elevation Control Mechanism". Detecting such behavior is crucial as it could indicate an attacker trying to gain elevated privileges through tools resembling PsExec or other similar utilities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in Sysmon for instances that match the identified command-line parameters. Take note of the initiating user and any parent processes that may provide context about the execution.
  - **Cross-Reference User Accounts:** Utilize Active Directory or local user accounts logs to verify the details of the accounts being targeted for elevation. Determine if these accounts normally engage in these types of operations.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Check network activity related to the identified processes through EDR or NDR tools. This can reveal if the process is making calls to known malicious endpoints or abnormal external connections.
  - **Review Recent Accesses:** Look into Windows Security logs and AV logs for any recent alerts or anomalies concerning file accesses and execution rights by the user associated with the suspicious command execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of medium is assigned to this alert due to the potential for privilege escalation exploits in enterprise environments. Detecting command executions with elevated user permissions is critical as it may signal technical compromise attempts and could lead to a significant security breach if not addressed.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where attackers use obfuscation techniques to mask command-line arguments or where alternate tools do not utilize the commonly monitored flags and syntax. Additionally, if necessary logging (e.g., Sysmon) is not configured or is disabled, the detection engine will not capture the relevant events. Other assumptions include a baseline understanding of user behavior; anomalies may go unnoticed if such behavior patterns aren't adequately established.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential command-line obfuscation techniques frequently employed by malicious actors to evade security monitoring. The rule looks for specific escape characters and constructs within command-line parameters that may indicate an attempt to disguise or encode malicious commands. For example, the presence of common escape sequences such as 'h^t^t^p' or 'h"t"t"p' suggests that an adversary may be trying to hide their tracks by manipulating how URLs or network connections are formatted, which might not be easily recognizable at first glance. The technical data sources involved primarily comprise process creation logs, specifically focusing on the `CommandLine` field, which captures the arguments passed to executables. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1140: "Obfuscated Files or Information" within the Defense Evasion tactic, aiming to frustrate detection and analysis efforts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Inspect the process creation logs to identify any processes that contain the obfuscated command lines indicated in the alert.
    
  - **Analyze Parent Process Relationships:** Utilize EDR tools to trace the parent-child relationships of the flagged processes to establish context and determine if they were spawned from suspicious parent processes.
  - **Check Network Activities:** Investigate any associated network connections by reviewing outbound traffic to see if the flagged command line resulted in communication with known malicious domains or IP addresses.
  - **Cross-Reference with AV and EDR Findings:** Correlate alerts from antivirus solutions and EDR for additional insights into potential malicious behavior corresponding to the identified command line obfuscation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert holds a medium severity level, warranting timely investigations as obfuscated command lines can indicate an active evasion tactic, potentially leading to unauthorized access or execution of payloads in the environment.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments where command-line arguments are logged inconsistently or where potential obfuscation attempts do not utilize common escape characters defined in the detection logic. Furthermore, certain legitimate applications may generate similar obfuscation patterns, leading to false positives. It also assumes that all relevant process execution logs are being monitored adequately; isolated systems or restricted applications may bypass this logging coverage, making detection difficult.

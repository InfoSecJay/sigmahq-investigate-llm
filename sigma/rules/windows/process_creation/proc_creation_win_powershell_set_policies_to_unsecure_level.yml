  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects modifications to the PowerShell execution policy that could set it to an insecure level, enabling potentially malicious scripts to run on the system. The rule specifically looks for the use of the `-ExecutionPolicy` flag in the PowerShell process creation logs, particularly when values such as `Bypass` or `Unrestricted` are included in the command line. The telemetry sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, which capture relevant command-line parameters, and information about the image associated with the PowerShell executable. This behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (TA0002) and technique T1059.001 (PowerShell).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify PowerShell Execution Policy Change:** Utilize Windows Security logs or PowerShell logs to confirm that the execution policy has indeed been altered. Look for timestamps matching the alert and capture the user context in which the change occurred.
    
  - **Examine Process Creation Timeline:** Leverage EDR tools to review process creation events surrounding the time of the alert, focusing on PowerShell process instances and their parent processes to trace potential anomalous activity.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Check the SIEM for other related alerts (e.g., execution of suspicious scripts or unusual command-line arguments) that may indicate a compromise or misuse in conjunction with the policy change.
  - **Review User and System Activity:** Analyze logs for the user account that initiated the change to understand their typical behavior, checking for any signs of lateral movement, unauthorized access, or discrepancies indicating possible credential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is set to medium due to the potential risks associated with setting the PowerShell execution policy to an insecure level, which may allow for the execution of unauthorized scripts that could compromise the system or lead to further attacks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if PowerShell command execution does not clearly use the `-ExecutionPolicy` flag, or if the policy change is executed through Group Policy, which would bypass individual process logging. Additionally, it assumes familiarity with PowerShell and typical administrative tasks. If administrative users execute scripts to change the execution policy legitimately, those activities may not trigger an alert, necessitating context from security teams on routine operations.

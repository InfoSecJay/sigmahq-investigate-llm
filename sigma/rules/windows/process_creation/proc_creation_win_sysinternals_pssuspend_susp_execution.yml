  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Sysinternals PsSuspend Suspicious Execution" is designed to identify potentially malicious use of the PsSuspend utility from Sysinternals, which allows users to suspend processes in a Windows environment. This capability can be leveraged by attackers to bypass security mechanisms, particularly by targeting critical processes such as antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) applications. The rule examines process creation logs to detect instances where `pssuspend.exe` or `pssuspend64.exe` is executed with command-line arguments that indicate an attempt to suspend necessary security processes—specifically instances that include `msmpeng.exe`, the executable for Microsoft’s Windows Defender. 
  This activity is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** (T1562), specifically technique **T1562.001**, which pertains to the suspension of security processes to undermine platform defenses. By monitoring for the execution of this tool and its utilization on critical security processes, this rule plays a crucial role in enhancing security posture and detecting potential malicious activities in an enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origins**: Check the source and digital signatures of `pssuspend.exe` and `pssuspend64.exe` using Sysmon logs to confirm whether they originated from a legitimate or suspicious path.
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters**: Analyze the command-line arguments associated with the PsSuspend execution in EDR or process creation logs to determine if any unexpected or malicious processes were targeted.
  - **Inspect Suspended Processes**: Use Windows Task Manager or Process Explorer to review currently suspended processes, particularly focusing on any critical security processes like AV or EDR applications that may have been affected.
  - **Conduct Network Traffic Analysis**: Examine network connections in your NDR or firewall logs to identify any unusual outbound traffic correlated with the time of PsSuspend usage, which might indicate exfiltration or further malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the inherent risks associated with the suspension of critical processes that handle system security, which can lead to undetected compromises or data breaches within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several potential blind spots with this rule. It may not fire if PsSuspend is executed with valid command-line arguments but is not targeting critical processes. Furthermore, if an adversary renames `pssuspend.exe` to obfuscate its intent or executes it from a non-standard path, detection may fail. Additionally, the rule assumes that adequate logging is enabled on endpoints, and therefore, environments with limited Sysmon or process logging capabilities might miss these indicators of compromise.

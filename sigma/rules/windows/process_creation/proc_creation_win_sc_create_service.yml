  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on detecting the creation of a new service using the Windows command-line utility `sc.exe`, which can be a method used by adversaries to establish persistence on a compromised system. Specifically, the rule examines process creation logs to identify instances of `sc.exe` being executed with command-line parameters that include both "create" and "binPath". These parameters indicate that a new service is being defined and potentially could be linked to malicious activities, such as deploying malware that runs persistently. By monitoring Windows event logs, particularly those generated around process creation events, security analysts can observe suspicious utilization of system commands that deviate from standard operational behavior.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence and the technique T1543.003, which pertains to the creation of new services. Understanding this context can help incident responders recognize the potential implications of a triggered alert, as new services can often lead to escalated privileges or prolonged access by threat actors within an environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Examine the relevant Windows Security Event Logs to identify the specific instance of `sc.exe` execution, capturing the time and user context to assess potential unauthorized activities.
    
  - **Correlate with EDR Data**: Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to check for related processes or anomalous behavior around the time the service was created, providing a deeper context for investigation.
    
  - **Analyze Service Configuration**: Review the newly created service's configuration details, such as the `binPath`, to ensure it points to a legitimate executable. Look for known malicious paths or suspicious command execution behaviors.
    
  - **Check for Related Network Activity**: Explore network connection logs (using NDR tools) related to the host where the service was created to spot any unusual outbound connections that may suggest command and control (C2) activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as low severity; however, it should still be taken seriously within an enterprise environment as unauthorized service creation could indicate a foothold established by an adversary, leading to potentially more severe attacks if not addressed swiftly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the service creation activity occurs without legitimate administrative purposes. It may not fire in cases where legitimate software installation occurs, especially if administrative controls are present that allow such activities without triggers. Additionally, if an adversary employs other methods to create services (e.g., using PowerShell or modifying existing services), this detection may also fail to capture the event, highlighting the need for a comprehensive strategy that encompasses multiple detection techniques.

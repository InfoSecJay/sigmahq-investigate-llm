  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious child processes spawned by the Microsoft HTML Help program (hh.exe). Adversaries often misuse legitimate processes to execute their malicious payloads, blending in with normal activities to evade detection. The rule looks for specific child processes that are commonly associated with nefarious activities, such as CertReq.exe, cmd.exe, PowerShell, and others, which may indicate benign use or exploitation depending on their usage context. This detection leverages process creation logs from Windows, analyzing the parent-child relationship to spot suspicious process execution patterns. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques for this rule include Defense Evasion (T1047), Execution (T1059.001, T1059.003, etc.), Initial Access (T1566, T1566.001), and various related techniques for Windows scripting and command execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Hierarchy:** Utilize EDR tools to visualize the parent-child relationship of the hh.exe process and its child processes. Pay close attention to the context under which these child processes are being executed.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Investigate command-line parameters for any unusual patterns or indicators of malicious intent associated with detected child processes. Focus on scripts and executables known for exploitation, such as PowerShell and MSHTA.
  - **Review Execution Context:** Cross-reference the timing and source of the execution with existing logs from Windows Security and Sysmon to assess whether the execution aligns with legitimate user actions or anomalies.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Check any outbound or suspicious network connections associated with the offending child processes using network detection (NDR) tools. Note any calls to known malicious domains or suspicious IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for exploitation via commonly abused utilities, indicating a likelihood of malicious activity that may lead to further compromise of the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where attackers utilize alternative methods to execute commands without spawning known child processes of hh.exe or if they employ obfuscation techniques that mask process behavior. It's crucial to assume that the rule depends on the presence of Sysmon or similar logged data for accurate detection; thus, environments lacking appropriate logging may miss these indicators.

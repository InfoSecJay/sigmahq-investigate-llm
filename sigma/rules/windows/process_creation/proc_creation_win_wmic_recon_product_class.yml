  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Potential Product Class Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE" is designed to detect the execution of the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool. WMIC is commonly used for querying system information, and this specific rule focuses on instances where it is harnessed to retrieve details about the firewall and antivirus products installed on the system. By monitoring process creation logs, this detection rule looks for the invocation of `wmic.exe` and checks the command line parameters for keywords such as 'AntiVirusProduct' and 'FirewallProduct'. The underlying technical data sources primarily include Windows Sysmon logs, specifically focused on process creation events. This rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047, which details how attackers may execute queries against system components to gather intelligence on security defenses in place.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use the EDR tool to review process creation logs and identify instances of `wmic.exe` execution within the timeframe of the alert.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Check the command line parameters associated with the detected `wmic.exe` execution for the presence of 'AntiVirusProduct' or 'FirewallProduct' to determine the purpose behind the invocation.
  - **Check for Unusual User Behavior:** Investigate the user account that executed the WMIC command to assess whether their activity aligns with usual enterprise operations or if it appears anomalous.
  - **Consult Firewall and Antivirus Logs:** Query firewall and antivirus logs to ascertain any potential configuration changes or unusual access patterns that coincide with the time of the WMIC execution.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of the alert, the severity level is classified as medium. This indicates a potential reconnaissance attempt by an adversary to gather information about security measures, which warrants investigation but may not necessarily indicate immediate harm.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if attackers utilize obfuscation techniques to hide their command line arguments when executing WMIC or if they employ alternative methods for reconnaissance that do not involve WMIC. Additionally, this detection assumes that Sysmon is correctly installed and configured on all relevant endpoints and that users do not have legitimate business needs to execute WMIC commands for administrative tasks.

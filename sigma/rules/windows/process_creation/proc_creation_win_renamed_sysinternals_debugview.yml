  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Renamed SysInternals DebugView Execution" aims to detect instances where SysInternals DebugView, a tool commonly used for logging system activity, is executed under a different name. Attackers may rename legitimate tools to evade detection mechanisms, making this rule essential in identifying potentially malicious activity associated with tool misuse. This detection rule focuses on process creation events in Windows, specifically looking for processes that are recognized as originating from the SysInternals DebugView but lack the original file name `Dbgview.exe`. 
  The rule utilizes data from the Windows process creation logs which include details such as the process's name, its original file name, and the full image path. This rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's tactic of "Resource Development" and technique T1588.002, highlighting the malicious use of development tools like DebugView. Detecting renamed versions of commonly-used applications allows SOC analysts to identify suspicious behavior and respond promptly to potential threats.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Verify the process information using EDR tools to assess the image file path and creation origin. Ensure that any deviation from expected names or paths is thoroughly investigated.
  - **Review Event Logs:** Examine Windows Event Logs, particularly the Security and Sysmon logs, for entries related to the execution of Sysinternals tools. Check for any signs of unusual process creation activities.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Use NDR or firewall logs to identify any unusual outbound traffic correlating with the execution of the renamed DebugView. Look for communications to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  - **Inspect User Activity:** Investigate the user account that initiated the process to determine if it has a history of anomalous behavior. Review user access logs to ensure this activity aligns with typical user behaviors or roles.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the fact that renamed tools often indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious behavior, representing a significant risk to the enterprise environment. Quick identification and response to such alerts are essential to mitigate potential exploits leveraging legitimate tools.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One assumption is that the rule relies on the operational integrity of Windows process logging. If an attacker uses a custom version of DebugView or exploits another method to conceal their actions, the rule may fail to trigger. Additionally, if process logging isn't properly configured or if Sysinternals tools are frequently deployed for legitimate purposes, there may be a higher incidence of false positives. It's crucial for detection engineers to recognize that renamed or otherwise modified binaries might not always be captured effectively depending on system logging configurations.

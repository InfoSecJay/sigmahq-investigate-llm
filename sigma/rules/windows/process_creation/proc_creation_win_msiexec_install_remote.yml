  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Msiexec Quiet Install From Remote Location" Sigma rule detects potentially malicious use of the `msiexec.exe` utility, specifically when it is employed to install software packages from remote locations in a quiet manner. This behavior is indicative of an attacker attempting to conduct installations without user interaction, often as part of a larger attack strategy, such as deploying malware or backdoors. This rule specifically monitors the `process_creation` logs to identify occurrences where `msiexec.exe` is invoked with parameters that suggest a valid installation process is happening quietly (`-q`) while referring to remote resources (HTTP links or UNC paths) for the package location.
  The rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework and targets the tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically the technique T1218.007, which relates to the execution of remote scripts or applications that can bypass defenses. By analyzing the command line parameters used during the execution of `msiexec.exe`, this rule helps identify potential unauthorized installations that could signal a breach or compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Process Execution:** Use the EDR tool to trace the execution of `msiexec.exe` and examine related processes or parent processes that may indicate suspicious behavior.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Check the network connection logs to determine if there is outbound traffic that corresponds to the remote installation, particularly focusing on any unexpected connections to external IPs.
  - **Review Event Logs:** Inspect Windows Security and Application logs for any related events that occurred around the same time as the detected process creation, which may provide insight into user activity or additional malicious behavior.
  - **Containment Actions:** If confirmed as malicious, enforce containment measures by isolating the affected system from the network and initiating a full malware scan using the AV solution to mitigate any installed threats.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with unauthorized installations from remote locations, which may lead to deeper compromises within the enterprise network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire if the malicious actor employs obfuscation techniques or uses similar but benign command-line arguments for legitimate purposes. Additionally, if the `msiexec.exe` command is executed under a different user context (such as SYSTEM) or if the remote files are hosted on whitelisted domains or internal servers, it may evade detection. It is essential to consider the environment's specific baseline for legitimate `msiexec.exe` usage to avoid false positives and understand how attackers can maneuver to bypass this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule captures instances where the `rpcping.exe` binary is used to send a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) test connection to a target server while forcing the transmission of NTLM hash data. When executed, `rpcping.exe` is a tool that can be leveraged by attackers to validate communication with a remote machine, and it can inadvertently reveal sensitive credential information if used with specific command-line arguments. The detection is primarily based on process creation logs, focusing on identifying the execution of `rpcping.exe`, specific command line parameters indicating communication with a remote server (`-s`), and the presence of NTLM authentication arguments (`-u` for username and `-t` for transport type). This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1003, which pertains to credential access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Activity:** Check the timeline of the process creation in your EDR system. Look for details on the execution context of `rpcping.exe`, including the user account and process parentage.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Parameters:** Analyze the command-line arguments used during the execution of `rpcping.exe` in the related logs. Pay close attention to the parameters `-s`, `-u`, and `-t` as they indicate potential misuse for credential theft.
  - **Correlate with NTLM Traffic:** Use network monitoring tools to investigate any NTLM traffic associated with the time frame of the alert. This will help confirm if credential data was indeed sent over the network.
  - **Review Security Logs:** Consult Windows Security logs for any suspicious login attempts or authentication failures corresponding to the times when `rpcping.exe` was executed. Check for any additional suspicious activity linked to the user account used.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered medium because the detection of `rpcping.exe` sending NTLM hashes indicates a significant risk for credential theft, which can lead to broader network compromise if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot is that legitimate administrative use of `rpcping.exe` could lead to false positives, particularly in organizations that rely on it for remote connectivity testing. Additionally, if the tool is executed in an arbitrary manner without the suspicious command-line parameters being used, this rule may not trigger. Adversaries might also employ obfuscation techniques to hide their use of this tool, leading to challenges in detection.

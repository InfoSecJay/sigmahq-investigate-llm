status: test
description: |
  Detects uncommon child processes of the Add-In deployment cache updating utility (AddInutil.exe) which could be a sign of potential abuse of the binary to proxy execution via a custom Addins.Store payload.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Uncommon Child Process Of AddinUtil.EXE" is designed to detect instances where the Add-In deployment cache updating utility (AddInutil.exe) spawns unusual or unexpected child processes. AddInutil.exe is commonly used in Microsoft Office environments to manage add-in installations and updates. In a malicious context, attackers may leverage this utility to proxy execution of harmful payloads via custom add-ins. The rule focuses specifically on process creation events captured in event logs, examining the ParentImage to determine if it ends with '\addinutil.exe'. It ensures that only unexpected child processes are flagged by excluding well-known child processes associated with Windows error reporting, such as conhost.exe and werfault.exe. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1218), where adversaries aim to evade detection systems by blending malicious activities into trusted processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Examine Windows Event Logs (Sysmon or Security) for the process creation events related to AddInutil.exe to identify the spawned child processes and the user context in which they were executed.
    
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts**: Use EDR tools to check for any alerts or suspicious activities logged around the same time as the detection. Note processes that display abnormal behavior or communication patterns.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound connections initiated by the detected child processes to identify possible command and control (C2) communications or data exfiltration activities.
  - **Investigate Add-Ins**: Review the add-ins and scripts currently deployed in the environment for any sign of malicious content. Pay particular attention to any custom add-ins that may have been recently deployed or modified.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential for_abuse of trusted utilities like AddInutil.exe. While not all uncommon child processes indicate malicious intent, further investigation is critical to confirm or dispel any threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not capture all scenarios where malicious activity occurs, as threats may utilize other mechanisms to launch unexpected processes that do not interact with AddInutil.exe. Additionally, benign applications that mimic related behaviors could generate false positives. It is important to consider that skilled adversaries may utilize whitelisting or other evasion techniques to disguise their actions, potentially preventing the rule from firing.

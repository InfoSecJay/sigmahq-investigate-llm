  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially suspicious executions where a process operating from the user’s public folder initiates child processes associated with shell or scripting binaries, such as PowerShell or CMD. Attackers often leverage these common tools for executing malicious scripts and evading detection. The rule specifically monitors Windows process creation logs and focuses on the presence of parent processes located in the `C:\Users\Public` directory, which is often exploited for its accessibility. The alert correlates parent processes in public folders to child processes that utilize specific binaries known for both legitimate usage and abuse in malicious scenarios. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059) and Defense Evasion (T1564), reflecting malicious actors’ techniques for executing their commands while minimizing detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Parent Process**: Examine the parent process in the alert to confirm it originated from a user-accessible location, specifically `C:\Users\Public`. Use EDR tools to track process lineage and command initiations.
  - **Review Child Process Command Line**: Analyze the command line of the child process for any unusual arguments or script references that may indicate malicious activity. Pay particular attention to any suspicious use of shell commands or administrative tools.
  - **Correlate with Security Logs**: Investigate Windows Security logs for any failed or successful login attempts associated with the user whose public directory was accessed. This can help establish if a compromised user account is involved.
  - **Check External Connectivity**: Utilize network detection tools to identify any outbound connections initiated by the child processes. This will determine if there’s an attempt to exfiltrate data or communicate with known malicious IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the rule's focus on executable actions from a commonly exploited public folder, alerts from this detection should be treated as high severity. The use of legitimate system binaries in unexpected contexts often indicates potential malicious activity warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One challenge with this rule is the assumption that all users have legitimate access to the public folder; thus, alerts may be generated from benign usage scenarios. Furthermore, if attackers use file obfuscation techniques or less common executables, the rule may not trigger. An adversary adept in operational security might also clear logs or manipulate file paths to avoid detection by standard telemetry monitoring. Additionally, scenarios involving legitimate administrative scripts run from public directories could lead to false positives.

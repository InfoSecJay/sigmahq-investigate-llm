  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious usage of the `bcdedit.exe` utility in Windows environments. `bcdedit.exe` is a built-in Windows tool used for managing the Boot Configuration Data (BCD), which can be exploited by adversaries to alter critical system settings, potentially leading to unauthorized access or persistent malware presence. The rule monitors process creation events for `bcdedit.exe`, focusing on the image name and command-line parameters commonly associated with malicious behavior, such as including commands like "delete," "deletevalue," "import," or "safeboot." The logging sources employed for this detection rely on Windows process creation logs from Sysmon. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of **Defense Evasion (T1070)** and **Persistence (T1542.003)**, indicating its relevance in recognizing attempts to hide malicious activity and ensure continuous presence on a compromised system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Logs**: Check Windows Event Logs for recent process creation activities related to `bcdedit.exe`, specifically focusing on the command-line parameters used during execution.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data**: Utilize EDR tools to evaluate the full process tree and any parent-child relationships that may indicate suspicious behavior stemming from `bcdedit.exe`.
  - **Assess System Configuration Changes**: Investigate changes to the Boot Configuration Data using the `bcdedit` command output and cross-reference them with expected system configurations.
  - **Check for Lateral Movement**: Examine network logs for unusual access patterns or attempts to communicate with remote systems that coincide with the timing of the detected `bcdedit.exe` usage.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated from this rule are categorized as medium severity due to the potential for significant impact on system operation and security, especially if the use of `bcdedit.exe` indicates unauthorized tampering with boot configurations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger if malicious actors utilize other legitimate tools or lesser-known commands that do not include `bcdedit.exe` but achieve similar objectives. Additionally, there may be environments where usage of `bcdedit.exe` is common for administrative tasks; thus, context from other telemetry sources must be considered to avoid false positives. It is also assumed that adequate logging is enabled on the Windows systems being monitored to capture relevant events.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Cloudflared Tunnel Execution" Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the Cloudflare tunneling tool, "cloudflared," which is often leveraged by threat actors for establishing persistent remote access to compromised networks. This detection rule focuses on specific command-line parameters typically associated with cloudflared, such as those that reference tunnel connections and configurations. The rule analyses the Windows process creation logs to identify when a command-line execution includes keywords like 'tunnel', 'run', and various configuration flags (e.g., '-config', '-credentials-contents'). The primary data source for this detection is the Windows Sysmon process creation logs, making it effective at identifying unauthorized usage of the tool. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques of Command and Control (T1071), Application Layer Protocol (T1071.001), and External Remote Services (T1133).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Sysmon logs for process creation events that include the execution of "cloudflared" and review the command-line arguments passed, particularly looking for any unusual configurations or parameters that deviate from legitimate usage.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Utilize your Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to confirm if any outbound traffic is associated with the cloudflared ports (e.g., 7844) and assess whether unauthorized external connections are being made.
  - **Cross-check Endpoint Data:** Utilize your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool to investigate the specific endpoint for any presence of the cloudflared executable and other related artifacts, assessing whether it has been installed by authorized personnel.
  - **Monitor Cloud Environments:** Check for any unusual access or traffic patterns in your cloud logs (AWS, Azure, GCP) that indicate the presence of tunneled connections or services, validating whether there was any expected legitimate access during the time of the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is set to medium due to the significant risk that the unauthorized execution of the cloudflared tool poses; it can facilitate an attackerâ€™s persistence and lateral movement within the network, requiring timely investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire if the "cloudflared" tool is not executed with the specified command-line parameters, or if it runs in a way not captured by the Sysmon process monitoring. Additionally, legitimate instances of cloudflared in use could lead to false positives. There is an assumption that endpoint logging is properly configured and that sufficient visibility is present; if EDR or Sysmon implementations are incomplete, the detection may not capture all relevant events. Furthermore, some threat actors might attempt to evade detection by obfuscating command arguments or running the tool within a sandboxed environment.

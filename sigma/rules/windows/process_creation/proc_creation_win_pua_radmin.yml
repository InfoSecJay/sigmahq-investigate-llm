  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of Radmin Viewer, a remote access utility that can be misused by adversaries to gain unauthorized control of Windows systems. The rule leverages process creation logs to monitor for the specific characteristics associated with Radmin Viewer, such as the executable name "Radmin.exe" and its description. When an instance of this application is executed on a machine, it can indicate potential lateral movement or execution of unauthorized remote connections, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for execution (T1072) and lateral movement. By capturing these events, the SOC can effectively assess whether the utility is being used for legitimate administrative tasks or if it has been compromised for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Monitor Process Creation Logs:** Utilize Sysmon or Windows Event Logs to examine recent executions of processes, filtering for instances where "Radmin.exe" appears.
  - **Review Associated Command-Line Parameters:** Analyze the command-line arguments used during the execution of Radmin Viewer to identify any abnormal usage patterns or suspicious parameters.
  - **Check for Unauthorized Network Connections:** Investigate any network connections made by Radmin Viewer using EDR or firewall logs to determine if access attempts were made to external or unauthorized endpoints.
  - **Assess User Context:** Profile the user account that initiated the Radmin Viewer session to evaluate whether the account is authorized for remote access and if its recent activity aligns with expected behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this rule is classified as medium severity because the execution of Radmin Viewer can be indicative of unauthorized remote access attempts, necessitating timely investigation to determine whether the activity is legitimate or part of a broader compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where access to Radmin Viewer is permitted for legitimate administrative purposes, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, adversaries might evade detection by renaming the executable or using a different method for remote access that does not involve Radmin Viewer. Itâ€™s also important to consider that if Radmin is installed through non-traditional channels, detection might not occur due to lack of visibility into the installation processes.

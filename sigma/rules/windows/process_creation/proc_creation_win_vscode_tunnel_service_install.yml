  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Visual Studio Code Tunnel Service Installation" is designed to detect the installation of the Visual Studio Code (VsCode) tunnel service, which is often used to facilitate remote development workflows. This detection leverages Windows process creation logs to identify specific command-line patterns indicative of the service being installed. The rule specifically looks for commands that include terms such as 'tunnel', 'service', 'internal-run', and file references like 'tunnel-service.log'. By monitoring these command-line arguments, the rule aims to flag potential misuse of the VsCode tunnel feature that could be exploited by an adversary to establish command-and-control (C2) paths, in line with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Command and Control under technique T1071.001, which focuses on application layer protocols.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to identify the specific process creation events related to the detected command-line arguments, focusing on the relevant timestamps.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Investigate the context and source of the command, ensuring legitimate usage or installation paths are verified against the organization's software inventory.
  - **Check Network Connections**: Utilize network traffic analysis tools to assess whether there are unusual connections or patterns that correspond to the installation, particularly those related to remote access.
  - **Assess Service Configuration**: Examine the Windows Services console to confirm the configuration of the VsCode tunnel service, including any unusual settings that differ from standard configurations.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level, indicating that while the detection of this service might be benign under normal circumstances, it poses a potential risk for unauthorized access and lateral movement if misused.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is essential to note that the rule may not fire if the installation uses non-standard command-line options or methods to install the VsCode tunnel. Additionally, if an attacker uses legitimate administrative credentials or processes for installation, this detection may be bypassed. The assumption is that users of Visual Studio Code in the environment are not frequently performing installations of tunneling services, which could lead to a higher false positive rate during legitimate installations.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Browser Execution In Headless Mode" detection rule is designed to identify the execution of major Chromium-based web browsers—in particular, Brave, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi—when they are launched in headless mode. Headless mode allows browsers to run without a graphical user interface, typically used in automated testing or web scraping, making it a technique that malicious actors may exploit for covert operations, including data exfiltration or handling command and control (C2) activities. This rule specifically looks for process creation events where the executable names end with the aforementioned browser names and the command line arguments include `--headless`, capturing potentially suspicious browser activity.
  The alert generated by this detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the Tactic of "Command and Control" (ID: TA0011) and Technique "Application Layer Protocol" (ID: T1105). By focusing on process creation logs from Windows systems, this rule highlights actions that might indicate malicious intent or risk to the organization's security posture.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Check the process details in your EDR tool to confirm the file path and originating user account of the headless browser execution, ensuring it aligns with expected usage patterns.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Investigate the complete command line used for launching the browser to understand its additional arguments and potential automation scripts that could increase risk.
  - **Review Traffic Logs:** Analyze NSG, proxy, and network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections originating from the identified headless browser process, looking for indicators of data exfiltration or C2 communication.
  - **Contextual User Activity:** Investigate related user activity and access logs to determine if the user has a legitimate reason for running a browser in headless mode at the time the alert was triggered.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level as it indicates the use of browser capabilities in a potentially nefarious manner, warranting further investigation to assess any associated malicious activities, especially due to the common use of headless browsers for information gathering by adversaries.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the headless browser is executed from a non-standard or rarely monitored location, or if an adversary renames the executable files to evade detection. Additionally, there may be legitimate usage of headless browsers in development environments that could lead to false positives. The assumption is that all browser executions in headless mode are suspect; however, further tuning and contextualization are necessary for a fully accurate response.

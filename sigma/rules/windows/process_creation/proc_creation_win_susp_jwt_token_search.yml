title: Potentially Suspicious JWT Token Search Via CLI
id: 6d3a3952-6530-44a3-8554-cf17c116c615
status: test
description: |
  Detects possible search for JWT tokens via CLI by looking for the string "eyJ0eX" or "eyJhbG".
  This string is used as an anchor to look for the start of the JWT token used by microsoft office and similar apps.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma detection rule is designed to identify potential searches for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) executed via the command line interface (CLI) on Windows systems. JWTs are commonly used in various applications, including Microsoft Office, for authentication and authorization purposes. The rule specifically looks for command line arguments containing substrings associated with the structure of a JWT, such as "eyJ0eXAiOi" or "eyJhbGciOi". By monitoring process creation logs, the rule can detect attempts by an adversary to locate or exfiltrate these tokens, which may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources. This detection is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access (T1528), as capturing JWTs can facilitate credential theft.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the specific process creation logs in your EDR solution for instances where the command line contains suspicious JWT-related strings. Identify the user context under which this activity occurred.
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Determine the parent process of the command that triggered the alert to understand the context and potential legitimacy of the command execution. Look for any known offensive tools or unusual command line initiators.
  - **Cross-Reference with Recent Logins:** Check for recent user activity and login sessions in Windows Security logs to correlate the timing of the alert with other user actions, which may assist in determining if this was a legitimate user or an adversarial action.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Use NDR tools to assess if there were any unusual outbound connections initiated by the process associated with the alert. This can provide insight into potential exfiltration attempts linked to the suspicious command execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is considered medium due to the possibility that such searches indicate reconnaissance or preparation for a credential theft attack. Although not immediately indicative of an active breach, it warrants prompt investigation to assess the intent and potential impact.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if adversaries use alternative methods to search for JWTs, such as obfuscation techniques or scripting that diverges from typical command line patterns. Additionally, the presence of benign use cases for similar command line patterns presents a challenge; therefore, reliance on context and thorough investigation is essential. The efficiency of this detection is also contingent upon the organizationâ€™s ability to maintain comprehensive logging of process creation events.

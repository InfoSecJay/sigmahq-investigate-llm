  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on the execution of the binary `wpbbin.exe`, a component associated with UEFI-based persistence techniques. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) allows attackers to embed malicious code in the firmware of a system, which can persist even after operating system reinstallation or hard drive replacements. The rule monitors process creation logs to detect when `wpbbin.exe` is executed, leveraging Windows Sysmonâ€™s telemetry capabilities. The underlying technical data sources primarily include process creation events found in Sysmon logs. By correlating these events with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this detection is categorized under tactic `persistence` and technique `T1542.001`, which relates to the exploitation of system firmware.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Event Logs**: Review Windows Sysmon process creation logs for entries related to `wpbbin.exe` to confirm the creation of this process.
  - **Analyze Process Context**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze additional context, such as parent processes and command-line arguments associated with `wpbbin.exe` to identify any potentially malicious activities.
  - **Review Network Activities**: Investigate network connection logs during the timeframe of the alert to determine if the process attempted to communicate externally, indicating potential malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with Endpoint Data**: Check if there are any existing endpoint protection alerts or anomalies that coincide with the execution of `wpbbin.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert indicates a potential UEFI persistence method, it signifies a high severity incident due to the sophisticated nature of the threat and the associated risks of undetected malware persistence on enterprise devices.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - This rule may not trigger if `wpbbin.exe` is executed with modified paths or parameters that evade detection. Additionally, legitimate usage by hardware vendors like Lenovo could generate false positives.
  - It assumes that Sysmon is properly configured to capture process creation events related to `wpbbin.exe` and is active on all monitored endpoints. If Sysmon logs are lacking or misconfigured, critical events could be missed.

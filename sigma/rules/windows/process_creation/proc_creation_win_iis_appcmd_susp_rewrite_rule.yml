description: Detects usage of "appcmd" to create new global URL rewrite rules. This
  behaviour has been observed being used by threat actors to add new rules so they
  can access their webshells.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the suspicious use of "appcmd," a command-line tool used in Internet Information Services (IIS), to create new global URL rewrite rules. These activities are particularly concerning as they may indicate attempts by threat actors to manipulate web server configurations, potentially enabling unauthorized access via webshells. When the rule is triggered, it identifies process creation events for `appcmd.exe` where the command line includes specific parameters indicative of a command to set configurations for global rewrite rules within the IIS environment. The primary data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs and command line parameters, which can be captured through Windows Event Logs, particularly the Security log through Sysmon or EDR solutions. This technique corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically the technique TA0005 (Defense Evasion).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in Sysmon or your EDR solution for instances of `appcmd.exe` being executed, including the specific command line parameters used.
  - **Review IIS Configuration Changes:** Log into the IIS Manager and review the configuration settings for any unauthorized changes or newly created global rules that did not originate from legitimate administrative tasks.
  - **Analyze Event Logs:** Investigate the Windows Security Event Logs for any suspicious activity that may correlate with the timing of the `appcmd` usage, particularly focusing on logins or remote access that may precede the execution.
  - **Perform Threat Hunting:** Utilize network detection tools to analyze outbound connections from the server or application, looking for unusual patterns or connections that may indicate active webshells or unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential implications of unauthorized configuration changes in IIS, which could facilitate an adversary's ability to maintain persistence and control over affected web applications. Prompt investigation is essential to mitigate the risk of a successful compromise.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where legitimate administrative tasks are performed frequently with `appcmd`, resulting in false positives. There is also an assumption that the Sysmon or EDR configurations are properly set up to capture all relevant process creation logs. Moreover, adversaries could potentially obfuscate their actions by using various command line tools or methods to achieve similar results without relying on `appcmd.exe`, making it essential to combine this detection with broader security monitoring strategies.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious usage of the Windows Registry Editor (reg.exe) to add folder exclusions for Windows Defender. By monitoring process creation logs, specifically for the invocation of reg.exe, the rule seeks command line parameters that are characteristic of adding exclusions to the Windows Defender paths. The primary focus is on command lines that include specific registry keys associated with Windows Defender's exclusion configurations, particularly those that indicate a folder is being added as an exclusion (e.g., paths under `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions\Paths`). The rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562.001 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools), which addresses methods adversaries use to hide their malicious activities by preventing detection.
  The rule is particularly relevant in detecting behaviors linked to malware such as Qbot, which has been known to utilize this method to evade detection by marking specific folders, such as those found in AppData and ProgramData, as safe. This evasion technique is critical because it makes the malware's persistent files less likely to be scanned by antivirus solutions, effectively lowering the chance of detection and removal.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Recent Registry Changes:** Utilize Windows Security logs to investigate the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions\Paths`. Look for recent entries that may correspond with the times of any alerts raised by this rule.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze process creation logs for additional instances of reg.exe running, particularly those that do not seem to correspond to legitimate administrative actions. This can help identify other potential malicious activities.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Check EDR data for any alerts related to Qbot or similar malware during the time of the detected activity to understand broader context and potential system impact.
  - **Monitor for Related Network Activity:** Utilize your NDR solutions to review outbound connections that align with the flagged activity, especially those directed towards known malicious domains or IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the risk associated with an adversary deliberately modifying Windows Defender settings to evade detection. While the rule may capture legitimate administrative use cases, its context within active malware campaigns underscores the necessity for timely investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where administrative tasks routinely involve adding exclusions in a legitimate context, leading to potential false positives. It primarily relies on process creation logs; therefore, if command executions are obfuscated or executed through other means (e.g., PowerShell scripts or through malicious services that do not utilize reg.exe), these actions may go undetected. Additionally, if an attacker has elevated privileges or utilizes stealth techniques to modify Defender settings in silence, this detection could be bypassed.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious persistence mechanisms via the execution of `VMwareToolBoxCmd.exe`, specifically when it is used with the "script" and "set" flags. The rule focuses on identifying instances where the command-line parameters suggest that a script stored in a potentially problematic location is being set to run during specific virtual machine state changes. The detection leverages process creation logs, particularly the command line and image path, to determine if the VMware command is being executed with these specified flags and paths indicating possible misuse. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059) and Persistence (T1059), highlighting the potential abuse of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Command Execution:** Check the process creation logs in your EDR for instances of `VMwareToolBoxCmd.exe` executed with the "script" and "set" flags. Ensure to verify the command line and the execution context (user and time) to assess its legitimacy.
  - **Monitor Script Source:** Investigate the script or file path referenced in the command. Access the relevant file system logs to determine if the script's location is associated with previous incidents or other suspicious activity.
  - **Cross-reference User Activity:** Look at the authenticated userâ€™s recent actions by querying Windows Security logs. Ensure that the user has legitimate reasons for executing this command and check for other anomalous behaviors.
  - **Check for Other Persistence Techniques:** Review other logs for any signs of non-standard persistence mechanisms (e.g., Scheduled Tasks, Startup folders) being manipulated in conjunction with `VMwareToolBoxCmd.exe`. Utilize a range of telemetry sources across AV, Proxy, and your SIEM to build a holistic view of potential threats.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is marked with high severity due to the potential for persistent malware installation using legitimate tools like VMware. If an unauthorized user is setting scripts to run on VM state changes, it could indicate an active compromise, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the execution of `VMwareToolBoxCmd.exe` omits the "script" and "set" flags or if the command is executed from a clean environment that does not contain the suspicious paths listed. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks may inadvertently generate false positives, especially in environments heavily utilizing virtualization. It is also essential to assume that skilled adversaries may modify their command invocations or utilize obfuscation techniques to bypass this detection.

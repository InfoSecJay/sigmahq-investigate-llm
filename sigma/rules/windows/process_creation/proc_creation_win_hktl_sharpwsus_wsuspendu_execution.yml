title: HackTool - SharpWSUS/WSUSpendu Execution
id: b0ce780f-10bd-496d-9067-066d23dc3aa5
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the execution of SharpWSUS or WSUSpendu, utilities that allow for lateral movement through WSUS.
  Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is a critical component of Windows systems and is frequently configured in a way that allows an attacker to circumvent internal networking limitations.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of two specific tools: SharpWSUS and WSUSpendu, both of which facilitate lateral movement within networks through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). These tools can be used by attackers to manipulate the update services, potentially allowing unauthorized access to systems or distribution of malicious payloads. The rule focuses on process creation logs, looking for specific command-line arguments that are indicative of these tools being executed – such as ' -Inject ', ' -PayloadArgs ', and various commands associated with SharpWSUS. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics include execution (T1203) and lateral movement (T1210), highlighting the potential malicious activity that could arise from their usage.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Activity**: Use your EDR to investigate the process activity logs around the time the alert was generated, paying attention to the parent processes and any unusual command-line arguments.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Review the network connection logs to identify any connections that correlate with the execution of SharpWSUS or WSUSpendu, particularly to internal or unexpected endpoints.
  - **Review WSUS Logs**: Access the Windows Event Logs for WSUS to verify any unauthorized changes or interactions with the update system that may suggest misuse of the tools.
  - **Look for Other Indicators**: Search across Sysmon logs for additional suspicious activities linked to the same process, such as file creation or network communications that deviate from normal operational behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is high due to the potential for significant impact on the organization’s security posture through unauthorized lateral movement and manipulation of critical system services. Immediate investigation is warranted to prevent data breaches or system compromises.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire if an attacker uses obfuscated command-line arguments or alternative methods for executing these tools, potentially bypassing detection. Additionally, if the tools are executed without the identified command-line flags or if they're hidden via processes that do not invoke Sysmon tracking, detection may be ineffective. It's important for engineers to understand the nuances of environment configuration and adversary techniques that could lead to detection evasion.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Use of OpenConsole" Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the OpenConsole binary, which is often exploited as a Living Off The Land Binary (LOLBIN) by attackers to launch other binaries and bypass application whitelisting mechanisms. This detection rule identifies instances where OpenConsole.exe is being called, specifically tracking its original file name and the corresponding image path, while filtering out legitimate instances found in the standard Windows Terminal application directory. The primary technical data sources leveraged for this detection include process creation logs sourced from Windows Sysmon, which captures detailed information about newly created processes along with their command-line parameters and the originating paths. The related MITRE ATT&CK tactic is "Execution," with a focus on technique T1059, which categorizes the execution of code through scripting languages and command-line tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Sysmon process creation logs for instances of OpenConsole.exe being executed. Pay attention to the command-line arguments to determine if any suspicious payloads were launched as a result.
  - **Examine the Source Path:** Analyze the image path for OpenConsole.exe to verify its legitimacy. Ensure the executable is not running from any unusual or unauthorized directories that might indicate compromise.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate alerts related to process executions from OpenConsole.exe with other indicators of compromise on the host system. Look for any anomalies or malicious activity during the same timeframe.
  - **Analyze User Behavior:** Investigate the user account that initiated the OpenConsole.exe process. Determine if the account has a history of legitimate administrative tasks or if it appears to have been compromised or misused.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for it to indicate an attempt to bypass application whitelisting controls, which could lead to unauthorized execution of malicious code in the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if an adversary uses modified or renamed versions of OpenConsole.exe or executes it from a different directory outside of the standard Windows environment. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities that may involve using OpenConsole could result in false positives, particularly in environments where system administrators frequently utilize command line tools. Itâ€™s critical to assume that sophisticated attackers might employ various evasion techniques to circumvent this detection.

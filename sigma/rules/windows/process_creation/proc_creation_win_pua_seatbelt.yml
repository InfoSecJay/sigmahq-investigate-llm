  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "PUA 
  - Seatbelt Execution" is designed to detect the execution of the Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) Seatbelt, a reconnaissance tool often utilized by adversaries during their campaigns to gather information about the system and its environment. This rule focuses on monitoring process creation events specifically for the Seatbelt application by examining key attributes, including the image name, original file name, and command line parameters associated with its execution. The rule looks for instances where the application is invoked with specific commands that focus on extracting sensitive information or system details, such as credentials and browser histories. The detection sources primarily include Windows process creation logs, which capture relevant events when new processes are initiated. 
  The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics for this rule include **Discovery** (Tactic) and techniques such as **T1526: Component Object Model Hijacking** and **T1087: Account Discovery**, indicating that the use of this tool aligns with techniques that adversaries might exploit for reconnaissance and information gathering.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Validate Alert Source:** Use EDR tools to confirm that the alert correlates with the process creation events for `Seatbelt.exe`. Review the raw event data for additional context such as user account information and the timestamp of execution.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Examine the command line parameters associated with the detected instance of Seatbelt execution in the logs to determine its intent. Specific flags or outputs may indicate whether a legitimate process or malicious activity is underway.
  - **Review Related Network Activity:** Check network logs for any suspicious connections established subsequent to the Seatbelt execution, especially looking for outbound connections to uncommon or malicious IPs.
  - **Conduct Artifact Examination:** Use AV and Endpoint Protection tools to investigate any files or artifacts left behind by the Seatbelt execution. Look for indicators that might suggest the tool's use as part of a broader attack strategy.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity, as the execution of a reconnaissance tool can indicate a potential breach or unauthorized activity within the environment. It warrants immediate investigation to assess the impact and potential next steps in an ongoing attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if Seatbelt is executed with alternate or modified file names, or if the execution occurs in an environment where Windows process logging is disabled or misconfigured. Another assumption is that Seatbelt is not commonly used for legitimate purposes in the environment, which could lead to false negatives. Adversaries may also modify command line options or use obfuscation techniques to bypass detection.

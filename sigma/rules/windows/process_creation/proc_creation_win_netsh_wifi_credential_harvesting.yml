  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the unauthorized harvesting of WiFi credentials using `netsh.exe`, a Windows command-line utility that allows users to manage and configure network settings. The rule identifies processes that are created with command lines containing specific keywords associated with WiFi credential extraction. The primary focus is on instances where `netsh.exe` is invoked to clear or reveal stored WiFi passwords, which can indicate malicious behavior related to credential theft. This activity is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework as `T1040: Network Sniffing`, under the tactics of `Discovery` and `Credential Access`. The rule specifically leverages process creation logs, capturing key indicators such as the image name and command-line arguments that comprise the detection logic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Process Activity:** Review the endpointâ€™s EDR logs for corroborating evidence of the `netsh.exe` execution alongside any user or system account that initiated it to determine the context of the action.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters related to the process creation event; look explicitly for keywords indicating potential credential harvesting (e.g., 'wlan', 's', 'p', 'k', '=clear').
  - **Cross-reference WiFi Configurations:** Use system logs or network configurations within the organization to verify the legitimacy of the WiFi profile associated with the detected command. Check if the command was executed under routine administrative procedures.
  - **Query Windows Security Logs:** Investigate Windows Security logs to assess user authentication attempts around the same timestamp. This will help in identifying possible unauthorized access or attempts to access sensitive WiFi credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as medium due to the potential for significant data exposure, specifically regarding sensitive WiFi credentials. Given that such information can facilitate unauthorized network access, understanding and responding promptly to this alert is vital in protecting network integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the execution of `netsh.exe` with credential-harvesting arguments is not part of normal operational procedures in the enterprise. It may not fire if the attacker uses alternative tools for credential harvesting that do not involve `netsh.exe`, or if the command-line arguments deviate slightly from expected patterns. Additionally, if the organization has legitimate use cases for `netsh` in their administrative workflows, this could lead to false positives, necessitating careful contextual analysis by incident responders.

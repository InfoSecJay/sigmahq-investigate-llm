  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - Netcat Suspicious Execution" aims to detect unauthorized executions of Netcat, a versatile networking utility often exploited by adversaries for command-and-control (C2) operations. The rule focuses on identifying instances where the Netcat executable (ncat.exe, netcat.exe, or nc.exe) is launched, particularly monitoring the command-line parameters associated with its execution. Key indicators include command lines that suggest the tool is being used in a listening mode or with unusual flags that are not typical for standard operational use. The detection leverages Windows process creation logs to track instances of Netcat potentially being invoked maliciously, thereby enabling teams to respond to suspicious activities indicative of the ATT&CK technique T1095 (Command and Control Protocol). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review any alerts triggered by your EDR for the corresponding process creation of Netcat to gather context about the execution, such as its parent process and user account associated with it.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Utilize network logs from firewalls or proxy servers to determine if outbound connections were initiated by the identified Netcat process, especially to suspicious or unknown external hosts.
  - **Examine Command Line Arguments:** Look into the command-line arguments associated with the process creation event, focusing on any flags commonly used in malicious scenarios (e.g., flags such as '-lvp' or '--exec') to assess the intention behind the execution.
  - **Assess User Intent:** Investigate the user account responsible for launching the Netcat executable to discern if it aligns with normal operational behavior or if it exhibits signs of compromise (such as unusual logon times or patterns).
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for Netcat to facilitate unauthorized communication with external sources, which could indicate a significant security breach or compromise of an internal host.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection may not fire if legitimate uses of Netcat are common within the organization, leading to false positives. Additionally, itâ€™s possible that an adversary could rename the executable or obfuscate the command-line parameters to evade detection. It assumes that the Windows process creation logs are enabled and that appropriate logging levels are set to capture necessary command-line details.

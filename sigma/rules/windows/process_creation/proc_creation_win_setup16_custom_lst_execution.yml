title: Setup16.EXE Execution With Custom .Lst File
id: 99c8be4f-3087-4f9f-9c24-8c7e257b442e
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the execution of "Setup16.EXE" and old installation utility with a custom ".lst" file.
  These ".lst" file can contain references to external program that "Setup16.EXE" will execute.
  Attackers and adversaries might leverage this as a living of the land utility.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule is designed to identify the execution of the legacy utility "Setup16.EXE" in the Windows operating system when it is invoked with a custom ".lst" file. This executable can interact with external programs as specified in the ".lst" files, making it a potential tool for adversaries to perform living-off-the-land (LOL) attacks. The rule leverages process creation logs to capture relevant details, specifically looking for instances where "Setup16.EXE" is the parent process and is initiated with a command line that contains the argument " -m ". Data sources involved include Windows Event Logs for process creation events, which provide useful metadata such as the command line parameters and the path of the executable. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1574.005), as it aims to detect the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes without establishing a direct foothold.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Check the EDR or Windows Event Logs for any details about the process creation of "Setup16.EXE," examining timestamps and user context.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line parameters used during execution to identify any suspicious or atypical arguments, especially custom ".lst" files.
  - **Assess Parent Process Activity:** Investigate the parent process that spawned "Setup16.EXE" to determine if it is a known trusted application or if there are any anomalies in its behavior.
  - **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence:** Utilize threat intelligence platforms to correlate the findings with known indicators or tactics associated with the use of "Setup16.EXE" in cyber incidents.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity rating due to the rarity of legitimate usage of "Setup16.EXE" in modern environments. Its presence, especially when combined with particular command-line arguments, could indicate an attempt to leverage a known utility for malicious intent, warranting immediate investigation. 
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There is an inherent assumption that execution of "Setup16.EXE" with the specified criteria is always malicious, which may not hold true in rare legitimate scenarios. Additionally, the rule may not fire if adversaries modify the command line syntax or utilize alternate methods to launch the utility without being detected. Organizations need to consider that the presence of this executable in secure environments can be very low, possibly leading to missed detections in more dynamic or less secure setups.

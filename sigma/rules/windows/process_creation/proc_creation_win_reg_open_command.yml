  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Reg Add Open Command" detection rule is designed to identify unusual registry modifications often associated with credential dumping techniques, particularly those leveraging the Windows registry for persistence or evasion. This rule focuses on capturing command line actions that involve the Windows `reg` utility, specifically looking for operations that add or modify the `DelegateExecute` key under the registry path `HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`. By monitoring these command-line arguments, the detection helps in recognizing potential attempts by threat actors to exploit weaknesses in the registry to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as the SAM, SECURITY, and SYSTEM hives. This behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for credential access (T1003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in Sysmon to identify the parent and child processes associated with the detected `reg` command. Look for any anomalies in the process tree that may lead to malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with EDR Events:** Use EDR tools to investigate the endpoint behavior surrounding the alert time, focusing on potential lateral movement or credential theft indicators related to the altered registry keys.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Examine the command-line parameters of the `reg` command to confirm the presence of all specified flags and values, especially `/ve` and `/d`. This helps establish whether the command executed as intended or if it was manipulated.
  - **Review Security and Application Logs:** Check Windows Security and Application event logs for signs of unusual logon attempts or application behaviors occurring around the time of the registry modification, which may indicate exploit attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity as it indicates potential credential dumping activities, which can lead to significant security breaches if successfully executed. Prompt investigation is essential to assess the environment's integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the command is executed in a non-standard way or if the registry path is altered by malicious actors. Additionally, if the executing process is obfuscated or if logging for Sysmon is misconfigured, the detection could be bypassed entirely. It assumes that the monitored endpoints have Sysmon logging enabled and configured properly at the time of execution.

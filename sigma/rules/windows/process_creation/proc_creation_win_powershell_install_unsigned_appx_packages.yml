  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects attempts to install unsigned AppX packages via PowerShell commands, specifically the use of `Add-AppxPackage` or its alias `Add-AppPackage`. The rule focuses on the invocation of PowerShell executable (`powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe`) with command-line parameters indicating the installation of AppX packages, particularly when the `-AllowUnsigned` flag is present. By monitoring the Windows process creation logs, this rule captures potentially malicious activity that could instigate threats such as unauthorized software installations or bypassing security measures. This behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Persistence** and technique of **T1197 
  - Bypass User Account Control**. The threat actor may use this technique to ensure they maintain control over a compromised system or evade detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR for any instances of `powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe` being executed alongside the suspicious command-line arguments that include `Add-AppxPackage` or `Add-AppPackage`.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command-line parameters associated with the detected process to determine if the `-AllowUnsigned` flag was utilized, which indicates an attempt to install unsigned packages.
  - **Review Affected Systems:** Identify and assess the systems from which this activity originated to understand the context, such as user permissions, and previous installation history.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check relevant logs (e.g., Security, Firewall, and Application) to see if there are any additional events that correlate with this activity, suggesting a broader malicious campaign or user behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized software installations that can compromise the integrity of systems. Monitoring for this suspicious behavior helps in detecting attempts to introduce non-compliant applications into the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the PowerShell execution policy is set to restrict running scripts, or if the commands are obfuscated in such a way that they do not match the specified command-line patterns. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate administrative tasks, particularly in environments where unsigned AppX usage for testing is common. Furthermore, an attacker might use other means to install packages without triggering this rule, such as using different tools or modifying standard command syntaxes to bypass detection mechanisms.

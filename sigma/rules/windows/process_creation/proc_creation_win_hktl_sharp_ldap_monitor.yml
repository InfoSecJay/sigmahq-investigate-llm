  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - SharpLDAPmonitor Execution" aims to detect the execution of the SharpLDAPmonitor, a tool that can monitor the creation, deletion, and changes to LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) objects. The detection mechanism looks for specific indicators that denote the invocation of this executable, either through direct execution (process creation) or via the command line. The rule hinges on examining process creation logs to identify the launch of `SharpLDAPmonitor.exe`, where it checks for criteria such as the executable's file name and its original file name. Additionally, it monitors command line parameters that include keywords associated with user credentials and domain controllers (e.g., `/user:`, `/pass:`, `/dcip:`). This aligns with the **MITRE ATT&CK** tactic of **Discovery** (ID: TA0007) and its techniques related to acquiring information about the target environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Utilize your EDR tools to investigate the process creation events related to `SharpLDAPmonitor.exe`. Note the user context and timestamp associated with the execution.
    
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Review command line parameters used during the execution of the tool. Assess if they include any suspicious or unauthorized access attempts involving user credentials or domain controllers.
    
  - **Correlate with LDAP Activity:** Query your log sources (e.g., Windows Security event logs) for any LDAP operations around the same time frame as the detected execution. Look for any anomalous creation, deletion, or manipulation of LDAP objects.
    
  - **Review Relevant Network Traffic:** Use NDR and NGFW logs to monitor any outbound connections made by the `SharpLDAPmonitor`. Investigate the domains and IPs being contacted to assess potential exfiltration or unauthorized communication.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been classified as medium severity due to the potential for misuse of the SharpLDAPmonitor tool, which can facilitate unauthorized monitoring of sensitive LDAP interactions. Timely investigation is essential to prevent possible credential harvesting or further exploitation of the network.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire in environments where SharpLDAPmonitor is a legitimate tool in use, leading to false negatives. Furthermore, if the executable is renamed or if command line flags are modified beyond what is specified in the rule, it could elude detection. An assumption is made that endpoint protections and monitoring solutions are operational and configured properly, as any disabled logging or misconfigurations could create blind spots.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Renamed Jusched.EXE Execution" is designed to detect the execution of a process associated with the Java Update Scheduler (Jusched.exe) when it has been renamed or falsely impersonated by an adversary. In this case, the rule looks specifically for the execution of processes that include the term "jusched.exe" in their file paths but do not match the legitimate Java Update Scheduler descriptions. This tactic aligns with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1036.003, which focuses on **masquerading**, as threat actors often rename legitimate applications to bypass security controls. The primary data sources for this detection include process creation logs from Windows, which provide crucial information on new processes being initiated, as well as the command-line parameters that may reveal the actual intent behind the execution.
  The detection rule utilizes the "Description" field of the process creation log to differentiate between legitimate executions of Jusched.exe and potentially malicious ones that have been renamed. By filtering processes that contain "jusched.exe" yet do not conform to expected valid descriptions, the rule helps identify suspicious behavior that may indicate a compromise or an attempt to evade defenses.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Ownership:** Use EDR tools to check the owner of the detected process and determine whether it was initiated by a legitimate user or an unauthorized account.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters used during the execution of the process, as they can provide insights into the behavior and intentions of the running process.
  - **Review Recent Changes in File System:** Analyze the file system for any recent changes that involve the tampering or renaming of eligible executables, especially those within the Java installation directory.
  - **Cross-Reference with Known Threat Intelligence:** Search the threat intelligence database or logs for any known indicators associated with the Cobalt group or similar threat actors to understand context and potential impact.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this detection rule is classified as high severity due to the potential risk posed by renamed executables. Detection of such behavior often indicates sophisticated adversary tactics aimed at evading traditional detection mechanisms, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the adversary employs alternate methods of evasion, such as using a different filename or using packing techniques to conceal the malicious payload. Additionally, if the legitimate software updates are being executed normally, this rule could produce false negatives. There is also an inherent assumption that all instances of the Java Update Scheduler will conform to the standard description, potentially allowing customized or localized versions to evade detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious instances of the Windows process creation activity where the command line includes the term 'whoami' as the first parameter, specifically when appended to an executable (.exe) file. The 'whoami' command is typically used to identify the current user context and can be leveraged by attackers to gain information about their operating environment, such as user privileges and group memberships. This behavior is often associated with privilege escalation tactics like those employed by EfsPotato, a known exploitation tool that may allow unauthorized users to escalate privileges by manipulating access tokens.
  The technical data sources involved in this detection include Windows Process Creation logs that capture detailed information about processes being executed on the system. This logging can provide insights into the command-line parameters supplied to processes, which are critical for identifying suspicious patterns like the misuse of the 'whoami' command. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the Discovery tactic (TA0007) and the technique for Credential Dumping (T1033), where adversaries seek to gather information about the system that could assist in further exploitation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Windows Security Event Logs for any entries that match the specific command line pattern (e.g., '.exe whoami') to identify the origin and context of the invocation.
    
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Use EDR tools to check for additional context or anomalies associated with the process identified in the alert, including parent-child relationships and time of execution.
    
  - **Check User Access Levels:** Validate the user account that triggered the alert by cross-referencing it with the user access levels in Active Directory or other identity management systems to assess if the command execution was legitimate or suspicious.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Investigate any related network connections in the Security logs or the network traffic captured by Proxy/NDR tools, focusing on unusual outbound connections that may be related to credential dumping activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity due to the potential for privilege escalation and information disclosure, both of which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. A 'whoami' command being used unexpectedly may indicate potential malicious behavior that requires immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where command-line logging is disabled or partially configured on systems, resulting in missed executions. Additionally, advanced adversaries may obfuscate their command lines or utilize PowerShell with similar intent, bypassing this specific rule. It's also possible for legitimate administrative tasks to trigger these alerts, thus creating false positives. Analysts should be aware of the context in which 'whoami' calls are made and understand that not all instances represent malicious activity.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting suspicious `rundll32.exe` activity focuses on identifying command-line arguments that include the invocation of `.sys` files. This detection is significant because `rundll32.exe` is often exploited by adversaries to execute malicious code, and using it to run `.sys` files can be indicative of stealthy malware operations, as was observed with the UNC2452 group. The rule captures event logs related to process creation, specifically targeting the command-line parameters associated with the execution of `rundll32.exe`. Relevant data sources include Windows Security Event Logs, specifically the Process Creation logs, which provide insights into command-line activity and help in tracing the execution path back to the source. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion and the technique T1218.011, which focuses on the misuse of native system tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your EDR system for any instances of `rundll32.exe` accompanied by `.sys` in the command-line arguments. Look for unusual parent processes and execution paths.
    
  - **Correlate with Sysmon Data:** Utilize Sysmon logs to identify additional indicators of compromise related to the execution of `rundll32.exe`, looking specifically for any subsequent files or registry modifications that occurred after the execution.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Investigate any outbound network connections made by processes related to `rundll32.exe` to detect unusual or unauthorized traffic patterns that may suggest data exfiltration or command and control activity.
  - **Review Security Solutions Alerts:** Check alerts from your antivirus or endpoint protection solutions for any detections related to `rundll32.exe` or suspicious actions tied to `.sys` file usage, as these may provide context or corroborating evidence of malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the known abuse of `rundll32.exe` by sophisticated threat actors, such as those in the UNC2452 group, which poses a significant risk to enterprise environments and could indicate an active compromise or targeted attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may generate false negatives if the command-line invocation of `rundll32.exe` is obfuscated or if the malware does not include `.sys` files in its parameters. Additionally, legitimate applications that utilize `rundll32.exe` for valid operations may lead to false positives. An assumption is that all process creation events are correctly logged, which may not hold true in environments with restrictive logging settings or when the Windows event log is cleared by an adversary. Therefore, analysts should remain vigilant and consider the broader context of system behavior when investigating alerts.

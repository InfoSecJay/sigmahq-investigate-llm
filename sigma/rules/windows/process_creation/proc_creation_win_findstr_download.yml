  Detects execution of "findstr" with specific flags and a remote share path. This specific set of CLI flags would allow "findstr" to download the content of the file located on the remote share as described in the LOLBAS entry.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where the `findstr` command is executed with parameters that suggest it is being used to download files from a remote share. The specific command-line flags `-v` and `-l`, paired with a remote share path (indicated by patterns such as `\\`), allow attackers to leverage `findstr` for data exfiltration or other malicious activities. The rule analyzes process creation logs where the command line includes `findstr.exe` and checks for the defined conditions to trigger an alert. This behavior is notably associated with MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Defense Evasion (T1218), Remote File Copy (T1564.004), and others related to command execution anomalies.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Examine the process creation logs for the user that executed the command to determine the context of the operation and any related activities.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze network connections initiated around the same time to identify any unusual outgoing or incoming traffic, especially to external destinations.
  - **Check File System Changes**: Investigate recent modifications in the filesystem, specifically focusing on any files within the remote paths referenced in the command to track potential data exfiltration.
  - **Assess User Behavior**: Evaluate the userâ€™s historical activity and any prior alerts to establish a baseline; look for patterns consistent with evasion techniques or unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level as it indicates potentially malicious behavior typical of data exfiltration attempts while executing a legitimate Windows utility, presenting a need for prompt investigation to confirm intent and mitigate associated risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the execution of `findstr` does not use specified parameters or if the command is run from a trusted script context that is often ignored in process monitoring. Additionally, if an adversary disguises their command under an apparent legitimate operation or modifies command parameters, the detection may fail. Furthermore, reliance on process creation logs alone could omit crucial telemetry from memory or other methods of execution, which some adversaries may use to evade detection.

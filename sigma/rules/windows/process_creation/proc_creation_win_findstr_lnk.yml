  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on monitoring the invocation of the `findstr` or `find.exe` processes to execute `.lnk` files, which can be a potential indicator of malicious activity, specifically in the context of the HHS redirect attack. The detection relies on process creation logs that capture details such as the command line arguments used when executing these processes. When an instance of `findstr.exe` or `find.exe` is triggered with the command line indicating it is acting upon a `.lnk` file, it is flagged for further investigation. This action could be an attempt to conceal malicious behaviors by leveraging legitimate system utilities, fitting under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1202) and the technique of Command and Control (T1036).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine Windows Event Logs for any instances of `findstr.exe` or `find.exe` being spawned. Note the parent process and command-line arguments for context.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Confirm the command-line execution includes a `.lnk` file. Assess whether the usage aligns with legitimate business processes or indicates potential malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to assess related activities on the endpoint around the time of the alert. Look for additional suspicious behaviors or anomalies that could indicate an active compromise.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Investigate any corresponding network connections or outbound traffic from the affected system shortly after the alert. This may provide insight into further malicious activities or data exfiltration relating to the `.lnk` file.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is marked as medium severity due to the potential of malicious intent hidden within common system utilities like `findstr`. Investigating these alerts is essential as they could signify evasion tactics employed by attackers to execute unauthorized actions under the guise of normal operations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes consistent usage patterns and does not account for legitimate instances of `findstr` being used for benign purposes with `.lnk` files. Additionally, if an adversary employs obfuscation or modifies the command to avoid the detection criteria (such as changing the filename or arguments), the rule may fail to trigger. It is critical for detection engineers to consider variations in how scripts or commands could be executed to mask potential threats.

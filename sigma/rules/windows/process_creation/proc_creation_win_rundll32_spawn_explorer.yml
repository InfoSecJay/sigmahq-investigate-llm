  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "RunDLL32 Spawning Explorer" is designed to identify malicious activity where the `RunDLL32.exe` process is used to spawn the `explorer.exe` process in an atypical manner. Typically, `RunDLL32.exe` facilitates the execution of exported functions from a dynamic link library (.DLL) file, which in this context, is commonly associated with the `shell32.dll` library utilizing the `Control_RunDLL` function. By monitoring the `Process Creation` logs, particularly `ParentImage` and `Image` for the respective executables, this rule targets a known technique used by malware, specifically the Gamarue variant, to manipulate system processes for evasion and persistence. 
  The technical data sources involved include Windows event logs that document process creation events where `RunDLL32.exe` is identified as the parent process and `explorer.exe` as the child process. The rule specifically filters out instances where the command line used by the parent includes `\shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL`, ensuring that only those executions that do not match this pattern are flagged. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of defense evasion (Tactic ID: TA0040) and the specific technique of "RunDLL" (Technique ID: T1218.011).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Windows Security logs for recent `Process Creation` events that include `RunDLL32.exe` as a parent and `explorer.exe` as a child process, focusing on any abnormal timings or user accounts.
  - **Analyze Parent Command Line:** Investigate the command line arguments of the `RunDLL32.exe` instances to establish context; look for command lines indicative of malicious intent or those that deviate from the expected use of the executable.
  - **Cross-reference with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze any related processes and their behaviors over time, checking for abnormal activity linked to the identified instances of `explorer.exe`.
  - **Check for Indicators of Compromise:** Use threat intelligence tools to search for known hashes or signatures associated with Gamarue or other similar threats, correlating this data with the identified processes across your environment.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it indicates a significant potential threat as this behavior is uncommon and often associated with malicious activities aimed at evading detection. Prompt investigation is crucial to minimize any potential impact on the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the `RunDLL32.exe` process is being executed in a context that allows it to spawn other processes; however, it may not detect all instances if the attacker employs techniques to obfuscate the command line or uses alternative methods to execute `explorer.exe`. Additionally, legitimate software that utilizes `RunDLL32.exe` improperly or non-malicious scripts might inadvertently trigger this rule, leading to false positives. Adversaries may also pivot to other processes or methods of establishing persistence that do not involve these specific executables.

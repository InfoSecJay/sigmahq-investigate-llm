  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the usage of the `FromBase64String` function within PowerShell command lines. This function is often used by attackers to decode base64 encoded strings, potentially indicative of an attempt to execute malicious commands or scripts. The presence of this function in a command line can signify an evasion tactic where attackers attempt to obfuscate their activities or payloads. 
  The rule specifically looks for processes that include the `FromBase64String` substring in their command line arguments. The primary data source for this detection is process creation logs on Windows systems, which contain detailed records of the commands executed, including any parameters passed to scripts. By correlating this behavior with other logs and security tools, analysts can better understand potential threats and take appropriate actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Analyze the process creation logs in your EDR solution to identify the specific PowerShell command line that triggered the alert, noting the timestamp and any associated user information.
  - Check for any additional logs related to network activity (NDR) to see if there are connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains at the time the command was executed.
  - Review endpoint logs (AV/NGFW) for any file downloads or web activity that may coincide with the execution of the encoded PowerShell command, as this could indicate a broader attack.
  - If available, provide context using cloud logs (AWS, GCP, Azure) to see if any cloud resources were manipulated around the same time, which could signify lateral movement or further compromise.

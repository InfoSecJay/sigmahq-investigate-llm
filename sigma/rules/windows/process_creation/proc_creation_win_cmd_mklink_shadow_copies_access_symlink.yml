  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the creation of symbolic links to Volume Shadow Copies using the `mklink` command, a potential indicator of credential dumping activities. Attackers may manipulate shadow copies to extract sensitive information from the system, such as hashes of user credentials or other sensitive data. The rule searches for Windows process creation logs that include the `mklink` command, specifically looking for command-line parameters indicating the creation of hard disk volume shadow copies. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics include Credential Access, specifically techniques T1003.002 (Credential Dumping: Local File System) and T1003.003 (Credential Dumping: Volume Shadow Copy).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Details:** Check the EDR for additional information about the process, including the user account executing the command and any parent processes that may indicate benign administrative activity or malicious intent.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the complete command-line arguments associated with the `mklink` execution in the Windows Event Logs; ensure the context justifies legitimate use.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Look for corresponding events in Sysmon logs related to file access, registry modifications, or suspicious network activity that could indicate data exfiltration or lateral movement following the symlink creation.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Check Windows Security logs for user login/logout patterns and any previous credential access attempts by the same user to determine if this activity could be part of a larger attack pattern.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity as the creation of symbolic links to Volume Shadow Copies can facilitate credential dumping, posing a significant risk to enterprise security.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate administrators are creating volume shadow copies for valid reasons, such as backup processes. Additionally, if an attacker uses alternative command utilities or scripts that do not invoke `mklink`, this rule will not trigger. Awareness of these gaps can help detection engineers enhance coverage by incorporating additional detections for similar activities or by refining the rule to reduce false positives.

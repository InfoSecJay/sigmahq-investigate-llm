  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule identifies the execution of `shell32.dll` through `rundll32.exe` in directories typically associated with user profiles, such as `%AppData%`, `%LocalAppData%`, and `%Temp%`. By monitoring process creation events, the rule captures the command line parameters used during the DLL execution, focusing on patterns indicative of misuse or exploitation in environments where `rundll32.exe` is employed to execute shell functions. This tactic may align with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Defense Evasion (T1218.011) and Execution. Adversaries may leverage such methods to run malicious code from less scrutinized locations on the file system, thus evading detection from standard security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Source:** Check the originating process details in your EDR to determine if `rundll32.exe` is spawned from a legitimate application or an unauthorized process execution.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line arguments captured in the alert to identify whether they reference known malicious payloads or anomalous file paths.
  - **Review File Locations:** Use Windows file system logs to assess the contents and legitimacy of the DLL being executed, especially from suspicious directories indicated in the alert.
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Investigate any associated network connections made by the `rundll32.exe` execution using NDR tools or firewall logs for signs of data exfiltration or communication with command and control servers. 
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a high severity due to the potential risk of adversaries executing code from evasion-friendly locations, indicative of malicious activity that can lead to further compromise of system integrity or data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments with strict application control policies or when the execution of `rundll32.exe` is part of legitimate applications. Additionally, similarly named files or benign installations inside these directories can lead to false negatives. Adversaries who obfuscate their activity can defeat the rule by renaming executables or using alternative execution methods that may not trigger the defined conditions.

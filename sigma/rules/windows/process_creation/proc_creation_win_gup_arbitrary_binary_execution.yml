  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious use of the Notepad++ updater (gup.exe) to execute arbitrary binaries. The rule specifically looks for instances where `gup.exe` is the parent process, and evaluates whether it is invoking other legitimate applications—specifically, `explorer.exe`—to execute certain commands or executables, in this case, `notepad++.exe`. By examining process creation logs, the rule tracks the execution flow and alerts on suspicious command-line arguments that may indicate an attempt to abuse the updater for executing harmful code. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic this rule addresses is "Execution," and more specifically the technique for launching malicious binaries using trusted applications, thereby enhancing the detection of lateral movement or initial compromise scenarios. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR Logs:** Use the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) to examine process creation logs for occurrences of `gup.exe` as a parent process. Filter results based on timestamps and user context relevant to the alert.
    
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters associated with instances of `explorer.exe` launched by `gup.exe`. Look for unusual paths or command parameters that deviate from typical usage patterns.
  - **Review Proxy Logs:** Check proxy logs for outbound connections initiated by `notepad++.exe`. Identify if any connections were made to known malicious URLs or IP addresses related to the execution context.
  - **Consult Windows Event Logs:** Review related Windows Security, System, and Application event logs for additional context on the process execution, such as logon events or system resource modifications that may have occurred during the timeframe of the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level because while it indicates potentially malicious behavior, further investigation is necessary to confirm actual exploitation or misuse of the Notepad++ updater, which could also result from legitimate usage scenarios.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `gup.exe` process is executed under a different or unmonitored parent process, or if attackers employ a custom updater not associated with Notepad++. Additionally, environments utilizing altered or custom configurations for Notepad++ may not trigger the alert if those parameters deviate from the specified `filters`. Engineers should also consider that adversaries may obfuscate command-line arguments or employ similar tools to evade detection.

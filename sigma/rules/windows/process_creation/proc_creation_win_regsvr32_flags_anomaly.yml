  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential command-line flag anomalies when using the `regsvr32` utility in a Windows environment. The primary focus is on the use of the `/i` flag without the `/n` flag, which should be an uncommon practice. The rule relies on process creation logs to capture when `regsvr32.exe` is executed with these specific command-line parameters. Such command-line anomalies could indicate attempts at evasion tactics, particularly in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework under the tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1218.010). When adversaries misuse legitimate system tools like `regsvr32`, they might aim to bypass security controls, which makes this detection valuable for maintaining a robust security posture.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the logs from the Windows Security Event Logs for the process creation event IDs related to `regsvr32.exe` to confirm the execution details and command-line parameters used.
  - **Utilize EDR Tools:** Leverage EDR solutions to analyze the behavior of the process during the time of execution. Look for signs of malicious activity, such as file modifications or network connections initiated by the process.
  - **Inspect Related Events:** Review associated logs for any suspicious activity or events that coincide with the execution of `regsvr32`, such as unusual registry changes or other processes spawned shortly after.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** If applicable, examine the network traffic related to the process execution using NDR tools, especially for any unusual outbound connections after the execution of the command.
  ### Prioritization
  In an enterprise environment, alerts for this rule are considered medium severity. This severity reflects the potential risk of defense evasion tactics that adversaries might employ using valid system binaries, warranting prompt investigation to rule out malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where the command-line syntax used by adversaries is structured differently, or when the `/i` flag is not included. False positives can occur due to legitimate administrative tasks or user errors in command syntax, as noted with potential administrator typos. Additionally, the rule assumes that detailed command-line logging is enabled within the environment, which may not always be the case.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Calculator Usage" detection rule is designed to identify anomalous executions of the Windows calculator application, `calc.exe`, particularly when it is invoked with unusual command line parameters or launched from unexpected directories. Normally, `calc.exe` is located in Windows system directories like `C:\Windows\System32`, `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`, or `C:\Windows\WinSxS`. This rule helps detect potential evasion techniques or proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits by flagging instances where `calc.exe` is executed from other directories, or when it includes suspicious command-line arguments. It utilizes Windows process creation logs as its primary data source to monitor for these specific behaviors.
  This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly focusing on the defenses evasion tactic (T1036), which encompasses techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. By identifying these atypical usages of system applications, the rule aids in highlighting potential malicious activities that could be an early indicator of a security incident.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs around the time of the alert for additional context on the execution of `calc.exe`, including the user context and parent processes.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command-line parameters passed to `calc.exe`. If parameters appear suspicious or unfamiliar, gather information about the source process to understand its origin and intent.
    
  - **Check Process Path:** Look into the execution path of `calc.exe`. If it is not running from a known safe directory, this can indicate the use of a compromised or altered version, warranting further investigation into system integrity.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Tools:** Use SIEM and other security tools to correlate the occurrence of this alert with other events, such as unusual network connections or lateral movement attempts that might indicate wider compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for `calc.exe` to be utilized as a staging point for more malicious activities, this alert is categorized as high severity. Although `calc.exe` itself is a benign application, its misuse can signal advanced infiltration techniques that require immediate attention.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One limitation of this rule is that it may not trigger for legitimate uses of `calc.exe` followed by unusual command-line parameters in trusted environments where such usage occurs. Additionally, if attackers rename or mask their tools as `calc.exe`, this rule may fail to detect them entirely. Analysts should understand that obfuscation tactics commonly employed by adversaries may circumvent detection, warranting the need for additional layers of monitoring.

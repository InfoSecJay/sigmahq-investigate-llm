  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for renamed "NirCmd.exe" execution is designed to identify instances where a potentially malicious actor executes a renamed version of the legitimate NirCmd utility, which is a command-line tool from NirSoft capable of executing various system commands. This rule works by examining the process creation logs to look for processes where the original file name contains "NirCmd.exe" but the actual image has been renamed, specifically checking for renames to "nircmd.exe" or "nircmdc.exe". By leveraging the PE (Portable Executable) metadata fields, the detection mechanism ensures that any tampering with the executable name, which is common in evading security measures, does not go unnoticed. 
  This rule directly correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059) and Defense Evasion (T1202), which highlight how adversaries attempt to manipulate command-line interfaces and execute code with deceptive filenames to evade detection. Given the legitimacy of NirCmd.exe, this detection is critical for spotting potential use in malicious campaigns where tools like "NirCmd" may be leveraged for reconnaissance or payload delivery, specifically in targeted attacks as seen in the Mint Sandstorm campaign.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Query the EDR for process creation events around the time of the alert to investigate if the renamed "NirCmd" process corresponds with unexpected behavior or unauthorized commands.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters passed to the identified process to determine whether they align with known benign usage or exhibit signs of suspicious activity.
  - **Check for Malware Indicators:** Utilize antivirus and endpoint detection tools to check if the renamed executable is known for malicious activity, including performing hashes or scanning for similar filename obfuscations.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Investigate any network connections or DNS queries made by the renamed process via NDR and proxy logs to identify potential communication with command and control servers or other malicious infrastructure.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential use of a legitimate tool with malicious intent, particularly in targeting high-profile individuals. Any execution of renamed system utilities warrants immediate investigation to assess the potential risk to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in cases where the attacker utilizes a different renaming convention that does not match the specified "nircmd.exe" or "nircmdc.exe" patterns. Additionally, if the legitimate NirCmd.exe has not been modified or if an alternate method of execution is employed (such as running from a network share), the rule will not trigger. Furthermore, it assumes that Sysmon is properly configured to capture all process creation events, and any gaps in logging or EDR visibility may lead to missed detections.

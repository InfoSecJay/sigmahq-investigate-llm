  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed Sysinternals Sdelete Execution" rule aims to detect the execution of the Sysinternals tool Sdelete when it has been renamed, which is an atypical practice for administrative tasks. Sdelete is a specialized utility designed for secure file deletion, and it is crucial for system administrators to maintain a standard naming convention to ensure security and accountability. The detection mechanism focuses on process creation logs, particularly assessing the `OriginalFileName` field to identify instances where Sdelete (original name) is used, while simultaneously filtering out typical instances that match its renamed variants (e.g., `sdelete.exe` and `sdelete64.exe`). This rule relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1485, which covers the impact of data destruction on organizational stability.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine process creation events in the EDR for instances where Sdelete is executed with a renamed file name, focusing on the `CommandLine` for any unusual parameters.
  - **Cross-reference Parent Process:** Investigate the parent processes of the detected Sdelete launches to evaluate whether the execution originated from a legitimate administrative application or if it might indicate malicious activity.
  - **Check User Context:** Determine the user context under which the Sdelete was executed to distinguish between valid administration actions and potential malicious deletions by unauthorized users.
  - **Correlate Additional Logs:** Cross-reference proxy and VPN logs to trace any network activity surrounding the time of execution, looking for exfiltration or other suspicious behaviors.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a high severity level due to the potential for severe impact on data integrity and availability, especially since instances of renamed execution may indicate misuse of administrative privileges or malicious actors attempting to obscure their activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger when Sdelete is executed under its original name or by systems where normal logging practices are not enforced. There's also an assumption that the tool is deployed across the network, as environments without Sdelete would neither log nor generate alerts for its activity. Additionally, skilled adversaries may employ renaming or obfuscation techniques that bypass this detection.

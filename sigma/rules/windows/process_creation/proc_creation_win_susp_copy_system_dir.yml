description: |
  Detects a suspicious copy operation that tries to copy a program from system (System32, SysWOW64, WinSxS) directories to another on disk.
  Often used to move LOLBINs such as 'certutil' or 'desktopimgdownldr' to a different location with a different name in order to bypass detections based on locations.

  ### Technical Context
  This rule is designed to detect suspicious copy operations that transfer files from critical Windows system directories (e.g., System32, SysWOW64, WinSxS) to another location on disk. Attackers often exploit these directories to utilize legitimate binaries (often referred to as Living-Off-the-Land Binaries or LOLBINS) such as 'certutil' or 'desktopimgdownldr' in an attempt to disguise malicious activity. The rule examines process creation logs, specifically focusing on command-line parameters associated with file copying commands executed via cmd.exe, PowerShell (powershell.exe), or other utilities such as robocopy.exe and xcopy.exe. By monitoring instances where files are copied from these sensitive directories, the rule can identify potential evasion techniques that adversaries may employ to bypass security measures. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1036.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts for additional context around the process creation event tied to the suspicious copy operation, focusing on the associated user and time stamps.
  - **Analyze Process Trees:** Use EDR capabilities to inspect the process tree leading to the event and identify parent processes or scripts that initiated the copy command for further investigation.
  - **Correlate Against Known LOLBINS:** Research the specific files involved in the copy operation against a list of known LOLBINS to ascertain if theyâ€™ve been used in previous attacks or if they pose a threat in your environment.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Look at user activity logs, including Windows Security event logs, to establish whether the user performing the copy operation has legitimate reasons for accessing sensitive directories, matching their privileges against their actions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the implication of potential unauthorized file manipulation from critical system directories, which can indicate preparation for further attacks. Prompt investigation is crucial to mitigate risks and respond effectively to any discovered malicious intent.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are inherent assumptions in this rule, primarily that it is dependent on the monitoring of process creation events across the relevant executables. This rule may not fire if the adversary directly executes other methods (such as modifying files without using common copy commands), or if administrative scripts legitimately call these commands. Additionally, the rule may be bypassed by malware that obfuscates commands or utilizes alternative copying methods not covered by the defined selections.

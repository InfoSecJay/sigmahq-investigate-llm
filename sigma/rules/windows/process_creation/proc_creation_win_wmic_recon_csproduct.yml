  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the execution of `wmic.exe` with the command-line argument `csproduct`, which can be used by attackers to gather detailed information about hardware components, including models and vendors. The Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility allows for querying system information, providing adversaries with insights about the target environment, possibly aiding in further attacks or lateral movement. The rule leverages process creation logs as a data source, specifically looking for instances where `wmic.exe` is run with `csproduct` as part of its command line. This behavior is indicative of the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation), which falls under the execution tactic, highlighting the potential for reconnaissance activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process**: Use EDR tools to confirm the process creation event for `wmic.exe`, including the timestamp, user context, and related parent processes to understand the execution context.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments**: Review the command-line arguments in the relevant logs to establish whether the `csproduct` flag was indeed used and assess any other commands that might have been executed in conjunction.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Check firewall and proxy logs to identify any outbound connections initiated by the system around the same time to see if there was data exfiltration following the reconnaissance query.
  - **Review User Activity**: Analyze Windows Security logs to determine if any unusual account activity or logins coincided with the time the command was executed, indicating possible misuse of credentials.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity because while the use of `wmic.exe` with `csproduct` is not inherently malicious, it can indicate preparatory steps taken by an adversary for further exploitative actions in the environment, necessitating further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if attackers obfuscate their usage of `wmic.exe` through alternative means such as renaming the binary or using encoded command-line arguments. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities may generate false positives, particularly in environments where hardware inquiries are routine. Furthermore, if monitoring on process creation events is poorly configured or if `wmic.exe` has been disabled on a system, this could result in missed detections.

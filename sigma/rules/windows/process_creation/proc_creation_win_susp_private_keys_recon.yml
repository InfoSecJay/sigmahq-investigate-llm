  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Private Keys Reconnaissance Via CommandLine Tools" is designed to identify attempts by adversaries to search for private key certificate files on Windows systems. This type of reconnaissance activity is indicative of credential access tactics, specifically aiming to locate insecurely stored credentials. The rule operates by monitoring process creation events, focusing on command-line tools commonly used for file searching, such as `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`, along with the `findstr.exe` utility. 
  The rule checks for specific patterns in the command-line arguments that suggest the user is looking for files associated with private keys, such as those with extensions like `.key`, `.pem`, or `.p12`. It leverages Windows event logs to capture this activity, specifically focusing on process creation logs, which provide insight into what commands are being executed and the contexts in which they are run. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1552.004, which addresses the reconnaissance of credential and key files.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to search for `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `findstr.exe` processes that match the detection criteria mentioned in the rule. Pay particular attention to the command-line parameters that reference private key file extensions.
    
  - **Correlate with User Behavior:** Investigate the context of the detected command execution by reviewing the user account activity in Security logs. Look for any abnormal behavior or escalated privileges that may suggest malicious intent.
    
  - **Check for Unusual File Access:** Use the file auditing capabilities of the file system (if enabled) to identify if there have been access attempts to sensitive private key files in conjunction with the detected command activities.
    
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** If available, examine network logs for unusual or unauthorized connections that may correlate with the timing of the detected reconnaissance actions to see if data exfiltration could be involved.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level because successful reconnaissance for private keys can lead to serious credential theft and enable further exploitation of sensitive resources within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire in situations where the adversary uses custom or less common command-line tools that do not match the specified criteria. Additionally, if process creation logging is not enabled or has gaps, legitimate reconnaissance activities by security personnel might be misidentified as adversarial behavior. It's assumed that users will execute the commands in the expected format; if they obfuscate command syntax or use direct API calls, the rule may fail to trigger.

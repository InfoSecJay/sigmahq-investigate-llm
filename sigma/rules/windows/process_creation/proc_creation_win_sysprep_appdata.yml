  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying suspicious usage of the Windows Sysprep tool, specifically when it is executed with a target in the AppData folder. Sysprep, a legitimate tool used for preparing Windows installations for duplication, is often exploited by attackers to execute malicious payloads or for persistence. By analyzing the process creation logs for instances where the Sysprep executable (`sysprep.exe`) is called with command-line parameters that reference the AppData directory, this rule helps uncover potentially malicious activities consistent with the techniques identified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the tactic of Execution (T1059).
  The key data sources for this detection include Windows process creation logs, which capture details about the executable that was run, including its command-line arguments. Specifically, the rule looks for instances where the process `sysprep.exe` is initiated and includes a command line pointing to a path within the AppData folder. The potential use of such a technique has been highlighted in threat intelligence reports, linking it to the Trojan Syndicasec campaign targeting satellite telecommunications defense sectors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Details:** Examine Windows Process Creation logs to identify the user and context under which `sysprep.exe` was executed to determine if it aligns with known administrative usage.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Use EDR tools to analyze any related alerts or events around the time of the `sysprep.exe` execution to ascertain potential malicious behavior or lateral movement activities.
  - **Inspect AppData Content:** Check the contents of the AppData folder that was specified in the command line for any unusual or suspicious files that could indicate a payload or script execution.
  - **Evaluate Network Connections:** Investigate any associated network connections made by the process during its execution, as they may reveal command and control (C2) communications or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity, as the execution of `sysprep.exe` with AppData as a target is not a common administrative practice and could signify an attempt to exploit the Windows environment. Quick action is warranted to determine the legitimacy of the execution.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  One recognized blind spot is that legitimate administrative scripts or maintenance tasks might generate false positives, especially in environments where system administrators routinely use Sysprep for deployment purposes. Additionally, if attackers employ obfuscation techniques or rename malicious files to credible names, the rule may fail to trigger. It is also assumed that the telemetry from process creation logs is being accurately collected and monitored, which is vital for the effectiveness of this detection.

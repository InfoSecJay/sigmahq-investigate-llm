  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Debugger Registration Cmdline" rule is designed to detect the unauthorized modification of executable files for accessibility features on Windows systems. Specifically, it looks for command-line arguments that indicate the registration of a debugger for core accessibility applications, such as Sticky Keys (sethc.exe), Utility Manager (utilman.exe), and others. This functionality can be exploited by adversaries to gain persistent, elevated access to the system or to execute malicious code at the logon screen, effectively creating backdoors. The rule leverages process creation logs, specifically focusing on command line parameters that are atypical for legitimate system operations. This threat aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Persistence and Privilege Escalation, particularly under technique T1546.008: "Event Triggered Execution."
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR or Sysmon logs to identify events related to `sethc.exe`, `utilman.exe`, and other specified binaries. Verify the command-line parameters associated with any suspicious process creation events.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Check Windows Security logs to analyze logon events and correlate them with the suspicious debugger registration times. Look for any anomalies, such as logins occurring shortly before or after the suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Investigate the specific command-line parameters passed at the time of the debugger registration. Evaluate whether they indicate potential misuse of the registered debuggers.
  - **Conduct Malware Scans**: Utilize your AV or endpoint security tools to perform a thorough scan on the system where the suspicious activity was reported, ensuring that no remnants of malware are present that could misuse the debugger registration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for an attacker to gain persistent elevated access through the misuse of built-in accessibility tools, which can lead to significant breaches of system integrity and confidentiality.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the attacker uses alternative methods to manipulate executable files without invoking the command line directly. Additionally, if legitimate administrative activity occurs that involves debugger registration for these executables, it could generate false positives. Assumptions include that standard process creation logging is enabled and that no advanced evasion techniques are utilized by the adversary to obscure their actions.

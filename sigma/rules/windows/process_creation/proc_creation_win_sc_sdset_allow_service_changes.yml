  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious modifications to the Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs) of Windows services using the `sc.exe` command. When an attacker alters a security descriptor to grant access to a service for a suspicious trustee, they may bypass established access controls. The rule monitors process creation events for instances of `sc.exe`, specifically when it is used with the `sdset` command to change service permissions. The rule looks for command-line parameters that indicate the assignment of broad permissions, such as allowing access to interactively logged-on users and built-in administrators, which could signify an attempt to gain persistence or unauthorized control over a service. This behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1543.003 (Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service), which highlights the risk of service configuration manipulation as a method of persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use your EDR tool to examine recent process creation logs for occurrences of `sc.exe` invoked with the `sdset` command and parse the associated command line for suspicious parameters.
    
  - **Confirm Security Descriptor Changes**: Cross-reference the identified DACL changes with the expected service configurations by analyzing Security and System event logs using Windows Event Viewer.
  - **Identify Trustee Accounts**: Determine the identity of the trustee (user or group) to whom access was granted by reviewing the command line arguments for indications of unauthorized or suspicious accounts.
  - **Assess Service Permissions**: Check the permissions of the affected services in the Services management console (`services.msc`) or through PowerShell commands, ensuring they align with organizational security policies.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity because unauthorized modification of service access can lead to significant security risks, including the potential for privilege escalation or persistent malware installation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses direct API calls or other means to modify service permissions that do not involve `sc.exe`. Additionally, if the `sc.exe` with altered command-line parameters is executed in legitimate contexts, it may lead to false negatives. The assumption is that all DACL changes will be captured; however, misconfigured logging settings might prevent visibility into such alterations.

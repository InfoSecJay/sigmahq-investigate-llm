  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious usage of the `rundll32.exe` process, specifically when invoked with command-line parameters that indicate it is executing inline VBScript. The rule watches for specific keywords in the command line, such as `'Execute'`, `'RegRead'`, and `'window.close'`, which are often utilized by adversaries to execute scripts as part of a malware deployment strategy. This type of behavior has been notably associated with advanced persistent threats like UNC2452, which are known for their sophisticated evasion techniques. The relevant data source for this detection is Windows process creation logs, which record the details of processes initiated on the system, including command-line arguments. By monitoring these logs through Sysmon, SOC analysts can identify attempts to bypass security measures through script execution using `rundll32.exe`, aligning the detection with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055, which pertains to process injection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine Windows process creation logs in Sysmon to identify instances of `rundll32.exe` execution that match the criteria specified in the rule.
  - **Check for Parent Process:** Investigate the parent process of the detected `rundll32.exe` instances to determine if they are invoked by legitimate applications or if they are spawned by suspicious processes.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Inspect the command-line parameters utilized by `rundll32.exe` to confirm the presence of keywords like 'Execute', 'RegRead', or 'window.close', which may indicate potentially harmful activity.
  - **Correlate with EDR and AV Logs:** Cross-reference the findings with EDR alerts and AV logs to identify any additional indicators of compromise or other associated malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to the potential implications of script execution via `rundll32.exe`, which can serve as a mechanism for adversaries to exfiltrate data, move laterally, or establish persistence within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious actors modify the command-line parameters to evade detection or if they utilize alternative tools capable of executing VBScript without utilizing `rundll32.exe`. The rule relies heavily on accurate command-line logging; any misconfiguration in Sysmon could lead to missed detections. Additionally, false positives are possible if legitimate applications trigger similar command-line signatures.

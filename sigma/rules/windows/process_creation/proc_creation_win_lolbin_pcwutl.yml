  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious code execution that utilizes the `pcwutl.dll` library, specifically through the `LaunchApplication` function. By monitoring Windows process creation logs, the rule focuses on instances where `rundll32.exe` is invoked with command-line arguments referencing `pcwutl`. The underlying idea is that attackers may leverage the legitimate functionality provided by `pcwutl.dll` for defensive evasion or as part of a larger attack strategy. Investigation can be further supported by analyzing how commonly this library is used in support of legitimate applications, aiding in distinguishing between benign and suspicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Utilize EDR tools to review recent process creation logs and confirm instances of `rundll32.exe` invoking `pcwutl.dll` with the `LaunchApplication` parameter.
  - Analyze command-line parameters associated with the detected processes to determine if they are consistent with known safe operations or indicative of potential malicious activity.
  - Check for any unusual network connections or file activities stemming from the process, as this could signify an exploitation attempt or data exfiltration.
  - Review related logs from your SIEM, NDR, and NGFW for any network traffic or behaviors that correlate with the execution of `pcwutl.dll`, helping to contextualize the alert within broader observed activity.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify the unauthorized execution of `ldifde.exe`, a tool commonly used to export Active Directory (AD) structures in Windows environments. The rule works by monitoring process creation events specifically looking for instances where `ldifde.exe` is executed with certain command-line parameters indicative of export attempts, such as `-f`, but excludes instances where it is run with the `-i` (import) option. The data sources involved primarily include Windows Security and Sysmon logs, which capture detailed information about the process execution, including the command-line arguments provided during the invocation. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Exfiltration** (ATT&CK ID: T1041), as it can be used by threat actors to gather and extract sensitive information from the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:** Look for the `ldifde.exe` process in EDR logs, paying particular attention to its command-line arguments and the user context in which it was executed.
  - **Review AD Access Logs:** Consult Active Directory logs for any unusual access patterns or abnormal activity related to the accounts that executed the command.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to identify any outbound communications that may correlate with the timing of the `ldifde.exe` execution, which could indicate exfiltration of data.
  - **Validate Context of Use:** Verify whether the usage of `ldifde.exe` aligns with the normal operational practices of the organization to identify potential misuse or malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been assigned a medium severity due to the sensitive nature of Active Directory data that could be exposed and exploited if accessed by unauthorized personnel.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire in environments where the use of `ldifde.exe` is a common and legitimate practice, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an attacker uses obfuscation techniques or executes the commands under a process that is whitelisted, detection might be bypassed. This rule assumes that Sysmon is properly configured and running on endpoints to capture the necessary process creation events.

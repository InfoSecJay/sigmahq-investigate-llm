  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies malicious use of `devinit.exe`, a legitimate Windows component that can be exploited as a Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBIN) to download arbitrary MSI packages. The rule specifically looks for the combination of command-line flags associated with the installation of an MSI file via an HTTP link, which is an atypical behavior for this executable in a normal operating environment. It relies on process creation logs to capture the command-line parameters used to execute `devinit.exe`. When matched against the specified criteria, this activity may suggest an attempt to bypass security controls and execute arbitrary code within the system. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Execution (T1218) and Defense Evasion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Context:** Review the `process_creation` logs in your EDR solution for the occurrence of `devinit.exe` and analyze parent processes to understand the execution chain.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments:** Check the complete command line used for the execution of `devinit.exe` to confirm the presence of both `-t msi-install` and `-i http` parameters.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize network logging (NDR/NGFW) to trace any outgoing connections to unusual or unauthorized domains that were requested during the time of the detected event.
  - **Check MSI File Integrity:** If an MSI was downloaded, analyze its hash against known malicious signatures using threat intelligence feeds to assess the risk.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity because while the use of `devinit.exe` for downloading MSIs indicates potential malicious intent, it can also be part of legitimate software deployment processes. Contextual analysis of the environment is necessary to determine any immediate threat.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `devinit.exe` is used with different parameters or if the MSI installation is done through alternative methods. Additionally, if the executable is executed in a manner that obfuscates command-line parameters (e.g., through script-driven invocation or manipulation), detection may fail. It assumes `devinit.exe` is not whitelisted or deemed safe for other automated processes in your environment, and that no other benign use of the command-line flags is present.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - WinRM Access Via Evil-WinRM" is designed to detect potential lateral movement activities using the Evil-WinRM tool, which enables adversaries to exploit valid accounts to gain remote access to Windows systems. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the executed image ends with `ruby.exe`â€”the binary used by Evil-WinRM. It also inspects the command-line parameters for flags indicative of a WinRM session, specifically those containing `-i` (indicating an interactive session), `-u` (for specifying a username), and `-p` (for supplying a password). This detection relies on Windows process creation logs from Sysmon, which provide insight into how processes are initiated on Windows systems.
  The rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for "Lateral Movement" (ID: T1021.006), where adversaries may leverage remote management protocols such as WinRM to extend their reach within an enterprise environment. By monitoring specific command-line arguments associated with known malicious tools, incident responders can identify and investigate unauthorized access attempts that may indicate credential theft or misuse.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use Sysmon or Windows Security logs to check for instances of `ruby.exe` running along with relevant command-line parameters that indicate potential misuse of Evil-WinRM.
  - **Analyze User Accounts**: Investigate the user accounts associated with the suspicious `ruby.exe` processes to determine if they are valid accounts or if there has been credential compromise.
  - **Check Network Connections**: Utilize your EDR or NDR tools to examine network traffic for connections to ports commonly used by WinRM (e.g., 5985, 5986), confirming whether persistent connections coincide with the activity.
  - **Investigate Presence of Evil-WinRM**: Search for any installations or artifacts related to Evil-WinRM on the affected systems to assess if the tool was deliberately deployed by an adversary.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity as it may indicate an active, unauthorized attempt to access servers using valid credentials. Prompt investigation is necessary to understand the scope of the incident and mitigate any potential damage.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is important to note that this rule may not trigger if the attacker modifies the command-line arguments or executes Evil-WinRM in a way that does not conform to the specified patterns. Additionally, environments with limited visibility into Sysmon logs or those without Sysmon deployed may fail to capture this activity. This can also occur if alternative methods or tools are employed by adversaries to gain remote access, bypassing the detection criteria set by this rule.

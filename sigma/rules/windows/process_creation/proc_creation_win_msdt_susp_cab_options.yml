  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious execution of `msdt.exe` (Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool) using the `-cab` command-line flag, which is associated with `.diagcab` files that may be exploited via CVE-2022-30190. Attackers may use this vulnerability to execute payloads packaged within a diagnostic cabinet file, evading traditional detection methods. The rule leverages process creation logs from Windows to look for instances where `msdt.exe` is executed with the specific command line parameter indicating a cabinet file execution. The detection is informed by the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1202), underscoring the method employed by adversaries to bypass security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine EDR Data:** Review the endpoint data for processes related to `msdt.exe` execution, focusing specifically on process creation logs to verify the command-line parameters used during execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate any instances where `msdt.exe` was initiated with the `-cab` flag and cross-reference these events against known trusted applications to identify potential false positives.
  - **Inspect File Behavior:** Utilize file monitoring tools to analyze the behavior of any `.diagcab` files executed on the endpoints, checking for any unusual activities or connections that could indicate compromise.
  - **Assess Network Traffic:** Review network logs for any connections spawned during the execution of `msdt.exe`, particularly those that may correspond to suspicious domains or IP addresses commonly linked with exploitation.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is treated with medium severity due to the association of `msdt.exe` with a known vulnerability that could lead to successful exploitation, potentially jeopardizing sensitive corporate assets and data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule relies on legitimate usage patterns for `msdt.exe`, which may cause false positives in environments where `.diagcab` files are utilized for standard troubleshooting. Additionally, the condition may not fire if attackers use obfuscated command-line parameters or if `msdt.exe` is executed without the `-cab` flag. It is crucial for detection engineers to consider the adversary's capability to mask their use of such programs, potentially using alternative arguments or methods, thereby bypassing this specific detection mechanism.

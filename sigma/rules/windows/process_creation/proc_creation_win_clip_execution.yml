  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Data Copied To Clipboard Via Clip.EXE" aims to detect the execution of `clip.exe`, a native Windows utility that allows users to copy data into the clipboard from command-line inputs. Adversaries may exploit this functionality to exfiltrate sensitive data or gather information from user sessions by copying text, command outputs, or other data types into the clipboard. The rule operates by monitoring process creation events, specifically looking for instances where the executable is runâ€”indicated by either its image path ending in `\clip.exe` or having the original filename as `clip.exe`. The detection directly relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Collection" tactic (T1115) pertaining to data retrieval operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review process creation logs from Sysmon or Windows Event Logs to identify when and where `clip.exe` was executed, including the associated user and parent process.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Cross-reference the timestamp of the clip.exe execution with user activity logs to determine if the execution was legitimate or potentially malicious.
  - **Review Clipboard Contents:** If possible, investigate what data was copied to the clipboard during the time frame of interest, as this can offer insights into the nature of the activity.
  - **Assess Notification from Related Tools:** Utilize EDR solutions to see if there are alerts related to suspicious file activity or potential data exfiltration efforts coinciding with the execution of `clip.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as low severity due to the legitimate use of `clip.exe` for innocuous purposes, but it should still be investigated, particularly in cases where the execution is unaccompanied by expected user activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection relies on standard process creation telemetry, which may not capture all instances of clipboard misuse, particularly if attackers employ alternative methods to access clipboard contents or obfuscate their activities. Additionally, if users frequently utilize `clip.exe` legitimately, there may be numerous false positives; thus, context around user actions is essential. Moreover, it does not account for other ways data could be copied or exfiltrated, such as directly through other applications or over the network.

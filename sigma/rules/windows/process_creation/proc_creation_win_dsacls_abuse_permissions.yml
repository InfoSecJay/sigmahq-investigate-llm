  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potentially Over Permissive Permissions Granted Using Dsacls.EXE" targets potential security risks that arise when the `dsacls.exe` tool is used to provide excessive permissions within a Windows environment. The `dsacls.exe` command-line utility is a part of the Active Directory Domain Services tools, allowing administrators to view and modify the security descriptor of Active Directory objects. This rule specifically looks for indications of over-permissive access being granted, identifiable by specific command-line parameters associated with the execution of `dsacls.exe`. 
  The technical data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs from Windows, specifically focusing on entries related to the execution of `dsacls.exe`. The detection criteria include checking the process's command line for key flags that denote permission modifications, such as `/G` followed by potential permission abbreviations like `GR`, `GE`, `GW`, `GA`, `WP`, and `WD`. By monitoring these specific changes in Active Directory permissions, the detection rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Defense Evasion" and the technique "T1218", which focuses on the use of system tools to evade security controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Execution Context:** Review EDR logs to confirm the execution of `dsacls.exe` and check user permissions for the accounts that executed the command. Ensure to look for unusual user behavior or accounts that should not be making such changes.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to examine the command-line arguments used with `dsacls.exe`. Identify whether the permissions granted were appropriate for the user or object in question.
  - **Check Active Directory Changes:** Query Active Directory logs to audit any recent changes in permissions on sensitive objects. Investigate the implications of these changes on the overall security configuration of the network.
  - **Engage with Administrators:** If legitimate changes are identified, verify with system administrators to confirm whether the changes were planned or necessary. Assess the risk associated with any granted permissions that appear excessive.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential risk of unauthorized access or data exposure resulting from the granting of excessive permissions. In an enterprise environment, such incidents can often lead to significant breaches if not promptly addressed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that `dsacls.exe` is used in a Windows environment, and may not fire if the command is executed through proxy tools or scripts that obfuscate command-line usage. Additionally, the rule could produce false positives from legitimate administrative activities, which should be accounted for during investigation. There might also be scenarios where permission changes are administered through other means not captured by this detection, limiting the visibility of such actions to analysts.

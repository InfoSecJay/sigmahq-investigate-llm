  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potential credential dumping attempts that leverage new network providers in a Windows environment. Specifically, it looks for process creation events where the command line contains paths indicative of network provider services. By monitoring these command lines, the rule aims to catch suspicious activities reminiscent of utility tools like NPPSpy, which can manipulate network provider settings to access clear-text credentials. The primary data sources utilized in this detection are Windows Security event logs, specifically those related to process creation. This rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Credential Access" and the technique "T1003: Credential Dumping".
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Security event logs for process creation events that match the rule's conditions and correlate timestamps with related security alerts.
  - **Examine Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command line arguments of the identified processes for any suspicious or anomalous patterns that deviate from typical legitimate network provider activity.
  - **Assess EDR Alerts:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to gain deeper insights into the behavior of the flagged processes, including memory analysis and network activity during their runtime.
  - **Cross-Reference with Blessing Lists:** If filtering has been applied based on known legitimate network providers, compare flagged activities with established approval lists to rule out false positives.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is prioritized as high severity due to the potential risk of credential theft, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data within the enterprise. Prompt investigation is critical to mitigating any associated threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an attacker uses less common or custom-built network provider services not included in the paths monitored. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions or configuration changes by IT staff could inadvertently generate alerts, leading to false positives. It's assumed that all network providers in the environment are accurately accounted for and that no legitimate software conflicts with the detection mechanism.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious process creation events executed via `WMIC.EXE` (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-Line). When malware or an attacker attempts to execute arbitrary commands, they may leverage `WMIC.EXE` to facilitate covert command execution, particularly through the usage of `process call create` with known suspicious binaries such as `rundll32.exe` and `regsvr32.exe`. The technical data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs and command line parameters from Windows security telemetry. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique "T1047 
  - Windows Management Instrumentation".
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Events**: Use your EDR solution to correlate correlated alerts with process creation events for `WMIC.EXE` to gather detailed process execution behavior and parent-child relationships.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments**: Examine the command-line parameters associated with the detected `WMIC.EXE` process to identify any suspicious litany of commands or executable paths that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Check System Logs**: Investigate related Windows Security and System logs for abnormal or unauthorized access patterns that may have led to the `WMIC.EXE` execution.
  - **Threat Intelligence Research**: Consult threat intelligence sources to verify if the detected binaries or command patterns correlate with known malicious entities or campaigns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is categorized as high due to the likelihood of malicious activity exploiting legitimate Windows tools for lateral movement or execution of payloads, making it imperative for SOC teams to respond promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Detection may be limited if attackers employ obfuscation techniques or use non-standard command syntax with `WMIC`, which may not match the predefined suspicious patterns. Additionally, environments that restrict the usage of `WMIC.EXE` may not generate this alert, potentially allowing malicious actors to circumvent detection. Regular updates to the list of suspicious commands and binaries are essential, as threat behavior evolves rapidly.

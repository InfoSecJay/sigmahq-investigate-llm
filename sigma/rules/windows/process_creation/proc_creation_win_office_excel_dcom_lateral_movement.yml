  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential lateral movement within a Windows environment by monitoring for suspicious child processes spawned by Excel (excel.exe) through the use of the "ActivateMicrosoftApp" DCOM object. When Excel initiates a process like foxprow.exe, schdplus.exe, or winproj.exe, it may indicate malicious activity, as these processes are not typically associated with standard operations involving Excel. The rule focuses on events logged in the Windows process creation logs, specifically looking for the parent-child relationships in the process tree. This behavior is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1021.003, which pertains to application layer remote services, suggesting that an adversary may be leveraging this mechanism to execute commands or programs on a remote machine.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your Windows EDR for entries that show excel.exe as the parent process followed by any of the identified child processes (foxprow.exe, schdplus.exe, or winproj.exe). Focus on timestamps to determine the timing and possible intention behind these actions.
    
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize your network detection tools to analyze if there are any outbound connections initiated by the identified child processes. This can provide insights into potential data exfiltration or communication with command and control servers.
    
  - **Check User Context and Permissions:** Investigate the user account that initiated the Excel process. Ensure that there are no indications of credential theft or that the account has not been unusually escalated in privileges for the action being performed.
    
  - **Examine Event Logs for Anomalies:** Query the Windows Event Logs (Security, Application, and System) for any anomalies around the same time that may correlate with the spawning of the child processes. Look for events that might indicate prior lateral movement or exploitation attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, the detection of suspicious child processes from Excel should be treated with urgency, as it may indicate an active lateral movement attempt by an adversary, posing significant risk to the security of the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the malicious child processes are named differently or if Excel is not the legitimate parent process. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may mask their process names or use legitimate processes as decoys, evading this rule. There’s an assumption that all relevant telemetry is correctly configured and collected from endpoints, so any gaps in logging could prevent detection. It’s crucial for the detection engineering team to ensure comprehensive coverage and to continuously update the rule as new threat intelligence emerges.

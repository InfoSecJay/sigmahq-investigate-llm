  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Enumeration for 3rd Party Creds From CLI" aims to detect suspicious command line activity that queries specific registry keys known to store user credentials for various third-party applications. These keys are often targeted by attackers seeking sensitive information to facilitate further exploitation or lateral movement within a network. The rule identifies processes that include certain paths related to software such as PuTTY, MobaXterm, and others in their command line. It primarily utilizes Windows process creation logs as the data source, specifically analyzing the `CommandLine` field to match against a set of defined registry paths.
  By referencing the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this detection falls under the "Credential Access" tactic (T1552.002). Investigators should recognize the context of credential harvesting techniques and the potential implications of such activities, especially in environments where sensitive information might be stored or transmitted.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Investigate related process details in the EDR for the identified process, examining the parent process and any associated user accounts to understand the context of the activity.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Retrieve the complete command line arguments from the process creation logs to identify any additional suspicious parameters that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Examine Registry Access Logs:** If available, corroborate the alert with Windows Security logs to find any direct access to the queried registry keys, enhancing the context around the alert.
  - **Assess User Context:** Determine the privileges of the user associated with the alert, as elevated privileges may indicate a higher risk scenario where sensitive information could be more easily exploited.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized with medium severity as the detection of registry queries for potential credential enumeration indicates possible credential theft activities. This could lead to serious security incidents if not addressed promptly, making it crucial for the SOC to initiate a thorough investigation to prevent any potential data breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious actor employs techniques to obfuscate command line calls or if the software querying the registry keys is not widely used in the environment, leading to false negatives. Furthermore, in environments where registry keys are subject to benign queries, there is a risk of false positives. It assumes that the relevant telemetry is properly configured and logged; hence, any gaps in logging settings could prevent the detection from activating altogether.

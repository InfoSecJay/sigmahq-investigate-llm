  Detects when a program changes the default file association of any extension to an executable.
  When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility. Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential malicious behavior where an executable file is set as the default program for a file extension, which could indicate an attempt to gain persistence or facilitate malware execution. Specifically, the rule looks for processes that utilize `cmd.exe` to issue the `assoc` command, which modifies file associations in the Windows Registry. By analyzing process creation logs, including details of the command line arguments used, this rule can pinpoint when a file association is changed to execute an arbitrary executable when files with a specific extension are opened, pointing to possible misuse of file association settings as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Persistence (T1546.001).
  The rule leverages Windows Event Logs, particularly focusing on process creation events (e.g., the execution of `cmd.exe`), and related information about command-line parameters passed to it. By triggering on specific command-line usage patterns that change the default application for an extension to an executable, the rule aims to catch suspicious configurations that can facilitate persistence for malicious actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the EDR tool for details on the execution of `cmd.exe`. Pay particular attention to parent-child relationships in the process tree to determine the source of the command.
    
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line arguments associated with the detected instance of `cmd.exe`. Check for the presence of the `assoc` command and any specified extensions to ascertain which file associations were altered.
  - **Inspect Windows Registry Changes:** Utilize the Windows Registry to look for changes in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT or HKEY_CURRENT_USER sections that correspond with the altered file extension. Confirm that the new executable associated with the file type is not a legitimate application.
  - **Cross-Reference Alerts:** Investigate any concurrent alerts or suspicious activities, such as file downloads or installations, that might correlate with the timing of the `assoc` command execution. This context could indicate an underlying threat or coordinated attack.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high-severity due to the potential for significant impact on system security. Changing file associations to execute arbitrary executables can lead to malware execution and persistent threats, making it crucial for timely investigation and response.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the use of `cmd.exe` as a mechanism to change file associations will occur without disguise, such as through obfuscation, which may allow an adversary to bypass detection. Additionally, if a legitimate application utilizes `assoc` for benign purposes (e.g., system administration tasks), it may lead to false positives. The rule may fail to fire in scenarios where file associations are altered using methods that do not involve `cmd.exe`, such as through direct Registry modifications by malicious software.

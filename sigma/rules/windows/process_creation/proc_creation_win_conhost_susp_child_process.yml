  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Uncommon Child Process Of Conhost.EXE" is designed to detect unusual child processes that are spawned by the Windows Console Host (conhost.exe). The rule primarily monitors process creation events where the parent process is conhost.exe, which is commonly used by various legitimate applications to handle console I/O. However, adversaries exploit conhost.exe as a living-off-the-land binary (LOLBIN) to facilitate malicious activities such as process injection, masking their actions by blending in with normal system processes. The rule inspects the `ParentImage` field for indications of conhost.exe and checks other criteria to differentiate between legitimate usage and potential malicious activity. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic is Defense Evasion (T1202), as this technique typically aims at avoiding detection by leveraging inherent system functionalities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs for instances where conhost.exe is listed as the parent process, focusing on the child process's Image and Command Line fields.
  - **Analyze Child Process Behavior:** Investigate the behavior of detected child processes, concentrating on their execution context, unique command-line arguments, and any network activity that may indicate nefarious actions.
  - **Correlate with Endpoint Data:** Check for related telemetry such as Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs, particularly for any unusual activities around the time the detected processes were created.
  - **Consult the Contextual History:** Look into the alert context for prior occurrences of conhost.exe being involved in earlier alerts, as well as user and system activity logs to identify potentially anomalous patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  An alert triggered by this rule should be treated with medium severity, as while unusual child processes may signify potential threats, they might also result from benign use cases of conhost.exe in legitimate applications.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in scenarios where attackers implement conflation techniques that disguise malicious processes as standard system processes. Furthermore, it assumes that conhost.exe will not launch in atypical contexts or under valid usages that are heavily atypical for a given environment. The presence of other monitoring tools or system configurations may also suppress the visibility of these activities, potentially leading to missed detections.

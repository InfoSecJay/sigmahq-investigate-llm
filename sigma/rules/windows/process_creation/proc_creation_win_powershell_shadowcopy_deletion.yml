  # Deletion of Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell
  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets the deletion of Windows Volume Shadow Copies, a technique often used by ransomware families like Sodinokibi/REvil to hinder recovery efforts. The rule operates by monitoring process creation events, specifically focusing on command line arguments indicative of malicious activity. Key terms searched include `Get-WmiObject`, `Get-CimInstance`, and `Win32_ShadowCopy`, which are typical commands used within PowerShell scripts to interact with Volume Shadow Copies. By assessing the command line execution for deletive actions (e.g., `.Delete()` or `Remove-WmiObject`), the rule aims to identify nefarious attempts to manipulate these system resources. This technique relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Impact tactic (ATT&CK ID T1490).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Windows Security Event Logs for process creation events that match the identified command-line parameters, paying close attention to unusual parent processes.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Use your EDR tool to track any associated alerts that may indicate lateral movement or persistence mechanisms related to the identified command.
  - **Check for Ransomware Indicators:** Investigate the environment for any signs of ransomware activity, such as abnormal file access patterns or encryption behaviors following the alert.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Inspect network traffic logs for any outgoing connections from the affected host that may point to command and control (C2) servers or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level assigned to this alert, it indicates a strong possibility of ransomware activity which can severely compromise data integrity and availability in the enterprise environment. Prompt investigation is vital to mitigate potential impacts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where the attackers obfuscate command-line arguments or utilize alternative methods for deleting shadow copies beyond those detected. Additionally, if an adversary has legitimate administrative access, the visibility into their activities could be limited. Furthermore, the rule relies on the presence of WMI events and PowerShell scripting; if these components are disabled or heavily restricted in your environment, the capability to detect such deletions may be compromised.

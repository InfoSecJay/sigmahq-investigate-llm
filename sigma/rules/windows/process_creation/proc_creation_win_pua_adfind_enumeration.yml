  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activity that involves the enumeration of Active Directory (AD) using the command-line tool AdFind.EXE. It looks for specific command-line arguments passed to the process, highlighting potential reconnaissance activities by malicious actors. Active Directory enumeration can provide attackers with valuable information about the structure and security of an organization's environment, making it a critical focus for detection efforts. The rule specifically monitors for command-line flags associated with listing password policies, AD administrators, and Exchange AD objects. The main technical data sources involved in this detection include Windows Process Creation logs, which capture the command-line parameters and behavior of processes initiated on the system. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Discovery" and the technique of "Active Directory Enumeration" (T1087.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check for the invocation of AdFind.EXE within the Windows Process Creation logs, focusing on the timestamps of the alerts to correlate with other system activities.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the full command-line used with AdFind.EXE to understand the specific enumeration actions taken. Pay special attention to the presence of sensitive flags like '-sc admincountdmp' and '-sc exchaddresses'.
  - **Cross-Reference with Authorized Activities:** Consult the change management records or authorized administrative tasks to identify if the activity was legitimate or part of scheduled maintenance. This can often help attribute the activity to known personnel.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Utilize EDR and security logs to look for lateral movement or other suspicious activities that may accompany the AdFind command execution, such as unusual network connections or abnormal authentication attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high sensitivity of Active Directory information, any alert triggered by this rule should be prioritized as high severity. Enumeration activities can expose critical account details and vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in cases where authorized personnel conduct legitimate Active Directory queries, leading to potential false positives. Moreover, if an adversary uses obfuscated command-line arguments or a different enumeration tool altogether, the rule may fail to detect the activity. Assumptions include that the logging level is appropriately set to capture all relevant process creation events and that AdFind.EXE is not renamed or executed in a non-standard manner. It is essential for detection engineers to continuously evaluate and update the rule to account for evasion techniques commonly employed by attackers.

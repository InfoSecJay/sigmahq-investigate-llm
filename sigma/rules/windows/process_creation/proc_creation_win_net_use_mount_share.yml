  ### Technical Context
  The "Windows Share Mount Via Net.EXE" Sigma rule is designed to detect the use of the `net.exe` utility for mounting network shares. This behavior can be associated with lateral movement techniques used by attackers, specifically under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1021.002. The rule monitors process creation events for the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe`, focusing on the command-line parameters that indicate mounting actions, such as "use" and the presence of network paths (e.g., `\\server\share`). The telemetry gathered primarily comes from Windows process creation logs, which include details about the executed binary and the command-line arguments that can indicate potential misuse or attack scenarios.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use your EDR to analyze process creation logs that triggered this alert. Focus on the timestamps, user accounts, and process trees leading up to the execution of `net.exe`.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Check the command-line arguments associated with the `net.exe` execution. Pay close attention to the structure of the share paths and evaluate if they correspond to legitimate organizational share locations.
  - **Correlate with Identity Logs**: Cross-reference the alert with user logs, including VPN and Proxy logs, to determine if the user had legitimate access to the target share. Investigate any unusual login patterns or geographic anomalies.
  - **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior**: In the context of the incident, examine adjacent systems for similar activity, and assess if further lateral movement occurred. This includes checking for unauthorized changes or other unusual processes initiated by the same user or system.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is deemed low, but it should not be ignored, as it may signal administrative actions as well as potential unauthorized access attempts. Responders should weigh the context and environment before dismissing alerts of this nature.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where the legitimate use of `net.exe` is common, particularly among administrative tasks or during scheduled maintenance scripts. Additionally, if an adversary uses alternative methods to mount shares (for instance, using PowerShell or other proprietary tools), the detection may fail to capture such activities. It's essential for teams to understand the operational context to differentiate between legitimate administrative use and potential malicious activity.

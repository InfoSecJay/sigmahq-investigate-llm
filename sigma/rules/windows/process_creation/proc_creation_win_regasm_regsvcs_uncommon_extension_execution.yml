  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially suspicious executions of the .NET utilities Regasm.exe and Regsvcs.exe when they are invoked with uncommon file extensions. Regasm (Assembly Registration Tool) and Regsvcs (Service Registration Tool) are legitimate Windows tools used primarily for COM object registration. However, malicious actors can exploit these utilities for evasion tactics, particularly by masking malicious activity under unusual file extensions like .dat or .jpeg. The rule analyzes process creation logs, specifically focusing on the Image path and CommandLine parameters to identify such behaviors. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of Defense Evasion, specifically technique T1218.009.
  The monitoring is performed through event logs capturing process creation activities in a Windows environment, with special attention given to fields such as Image and CommandLine to reveal potentially abnormal usage patterns.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation logs in your EDR solution to locate executions of Regasm.exe or Regsvcs.exe, paying close attention to the associated command-line arguments and file paths.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters used during the invocation, especially for any uncommon file extensions that indicate potential malicious intentions.
  - **Validate File Extensions:** Use your EDR or a file integrity monitoring tool to examine the context of the files with uncommon extensions to verify their legitimacy and understand their purpose in relation to the executed commands.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Look at the related network activity via NDR or NGFW logs to see if unusual outbound connections correlate with the detected execution, potentially indicating data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for misuse of legitimate tools for malicious activities. In environments where Regasm or Regsvcs are not commonly used, this behavior should be treated as a higher priority for investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire for several reasons: 
  - If the execution of Regasm and Regsvcs occurs with common file extensions or in a legitimate context, it will go undetected.
  - If source logging is incomplete or if the utilities are executed in a heavily obfuscated manner, the necessary signatures may not trigger the alert.
  - The detection relies on process creation logs, which may be disabled or insufficiently detailed on certain systems. It's assumed that such utilities are used sparingly in the environment.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of Certipy, a tool commonly used for enumerating and exploiting vulnerabilities in Active Directory Certificate Services. The rule focuses on identifying specific characteristics of the Certipy executable, including its metadata attributes such as the image name and original file name. Additionally, it monitors command-line arguments that are inherently linked to various operations performed by Certipy, such as account enumeration and certificate forging. By analyzing process creation logs, the rule can identify malicious activity potentially indicative of unauthorized attempts to access or manipulate sensitive certificate information within an organization's infrastructure. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Discovery (T1016), Credential Access (T1649), and is primarily relevant in enterprise environments where Active Directory services are critical.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Use EDR tools to search for any execution of `Certipy.exe` on the endpoint. Check the source of the execution to identify whether it came from known or trusted processes.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line arguments associated with the process creation to determine if they are typical for legitimate operations or if they suggest malicious intent (e.g., use of flags like `-ca-pfx` or `-vulnerable`).
  - **Examine System Activity:** Inspect related logs from the Windows Security and System logs for any unusual authentication activities or access to sensitive resources around the time of Certipy execution.
  - **Conduct Network Analysis:** Utilize network detection tools to monitor outgoing traffic that corresponds with Certipy operations, especially for any attempts to connect to known Active Directory servers or other suspicious endpoints.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been classified as high severity due to the potential for substantial impact if Certipy is employed maliciously, including unauthorized access to critical systems and data compromise within the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that Certipy is being executed in a straightforward manner, directly from a command-line interface. It may not fire if the tool is executed with different names or from non-standard locations, or if obfuscation techniques are employed by adversaries. Additionally, logs may not capture transient events or operations within containerized or virtualized environments, leading to missed detections.

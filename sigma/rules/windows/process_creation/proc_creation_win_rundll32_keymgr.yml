  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Key Manager Access" detection rule aims to identify unauthorized access and usage of the Stored User Names and Passwords dialog in Windows, commonly referred to as Key Manager. This tool is typically utilized for retrieving saved credentials, making it a prime target for threat actors attempting to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. The detection mechanism analyzes process creation logs to monitor instances where the Rundll32.exe process is executed with specific command-line parameters indicative of Key Manager activity. In particular, the rule looks for instances of the 'keymgr.dll' being invoked with the command 'KRShowKeyMgr,' which could signify malicious intent if executed in an unexpected context. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Credential Access tactic and the specific technique T1555.004, which focuses on credentials stored and accessed through Windows utilities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Investigate Windows Event Logs for process creation entries to identify the execution context of Rundll32.exe when the 'keymgr' and 'KRShowKeyMgr' parameters are present.
  - **Analyze User Activity**: Check associated user accounts and their recent logins or activities to determine if the access aligns with standard operational behavior or indicates anomalous activity.
  - **Inspect for Compromise Indicators**: Utilize EDR tools to look for other signs of compromise on the system, including unusual network connections and the execution of other processes that may indicate lateral movement or credential harvesting.
  - **Validate the Context of Access**: Cross-reference with documented administrative activities to confirm whether legitimate use of Key Manager occurred, ensuring that the alert isn't a false positive.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential risk of credential theft that could lead to unauthorized access and further exploitation within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in situations where the Rundll32.exe process is executed with obfuscated or alternative command-line parameters. Additionally, if attackers have administrative privileges, they may be able to perform such actions without being detected, particularly if they execute credential access utilities in contexts that would generally be considered legitimate. It is also assumed that the typical administrative use cases are adequately documented; thus any deviations should be thoroughly investigated.

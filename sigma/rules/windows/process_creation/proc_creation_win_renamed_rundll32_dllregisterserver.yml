description: Detects when 'DllRegisterServer' is called in the commandline and the
  image is not rundll32. This could mean that the 'rundll32' utility has been renamed

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially suspicious executions of the Windows utility `rundll32.exe`. It specifically looks for instances where the command line includes the parameter 'DllRegisterServer', indicating that a DLL is being registered, but the process image is not the legitimate `rundll32.exe`. This behavior may suggest that an adversary is attempting to evade detection by renaming the legitimate rundll32 utility, thereby facilitating malicious activities while blending in with normal system operations. The primary technical data sources utilized in this detection include process creation logs, specifically focusing on command-line parameters and image names. This rule relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution, particularly the technique for executing commands and scripts on a target system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Integrity:** Check the process's image path in the EDR to confirm whether it is indeed a renamed rundll32 or another legitimate process. Look for discrepancies in file sizes or digital signatures.
  - **Examine Command Line Arguments:** Utilize Sysmon logs to analyze the full command line used at execution to determine if any other suspicious arguments or patterns accompany the 'DllRegisterServer' invocation.
  - **Correlate with Historical Data:** Review historical process execution logs within SIEM for previous instances of the same image name or command line. Look for patterns or anomalies that may indicate ongoing malicious behavior.
  - **Network Activity Analysis:** Investigate any network connections made by the process through logs in NDR or firewall systems to determine if there are any outbound connections to known malicious domains or IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity as it indicates a potential compromise method used by adversaries to execute malicious code while masquerading as a legitimate system utility, which could lead to further exploitation of the target environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the adversary uses a different method of execution that does not involve 'DllRegisterServer' in the command line or if they use a different utility altogether to achieve similar ends. Additionally, if the legitimate `rundll32.exe` is manipulated or hijacked, the detection could rise in false negatives. It is assumed that the enterprise environment maintains regular monitoring of critical systems, but any lapse in logging or oversight on control measures may hinder detection.

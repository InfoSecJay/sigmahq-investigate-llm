  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed Remote Utilities RAT (RURAT) Execution" rule is designed to detect the execution of the Remote Utilities remote access tool (RAT), which can be used by threat actors for malicious purposes. This rule specifically looks for process creation events where the Product field matches 'Remote Utilities,' indicating that the software may be in use. However, it also applies a filter to identify cases where the executable names end with `\rutserv.exe` or `\rfusclient.exe`. If either of these executables is found but the product name does match 'Remote Utilities,' the rule generates an alert. The detection leverages Windows process creation logs to monitor when malicious or unauthorized versions of this tool are executed, responding to relevant tactics identified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under defense evasion (TA0005), command and control (TA0011), and discovery (TA0007).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Process Review:** Verify the listed processes in the alert against known legitimate executables. Utilize EDR tools to trace the execution path of the detected processes and confirm their legitimacy.
  - **Command-Line Analysis:** Examine the command-line parameters associated with the flagged processes to identify any indications of suspicious arguments or behaviors that could indicate nefarious intent.
  - **Network Traffic Inspection:** Analyze network connections related to the detected processes using NDR logs to identify any outbound traffic to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  - **Historical Context Check:** Review corresponding historical logs on activity prior to the alert. Check for unusual login times or other anomalous user behavior in conjunction with the identified process execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risk posed by Remote Utilities being exploited as a RAT. Given the tool's significant capabilities for remote access and control, unauthorized use could lead to severe data breaches or system compromises.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the Remote Utilities software would correctly report its Product field in the logs. However, it may not fire if the software is obfuscated, renamed, or if other legitimate applications mimic this behavior. Additionally, if threat actors modify the Product field or manipulate how the executable is launched, it may evade detection by this rule. Analysts should remain aware that legitimate uses of Remote Utilities, such as for remote support, could generate false positives. Continuous updates to detection rules and software whitelisting may be required for effective monitoring.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious modifications to the Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) of Windows services using the PowerShell cmdlet `Set-Service`. The rule primarily focuses on the command-line parameters associated with the execution of PowerShell (specifically pwsh.exe) and looks for specific flags that alter the security descriptor of services. When an attacker uses this cmdlet with the `-SecurityDescriptorSddl` flag, they can change permissions in a way that may allow them to hide services or prevent those services from being stopped, thus establishing persistence on the compromised system. This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Persistence (T1543.003), indicating an effort to maintain access to a system without detection. Key data sources include process creation logs and command-line activity captured through System and Security logs, particularly focusing on the execution of PowerShell commands.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Recent Process Creations:** Review the process creation logs in EDR to identify any recent instances of PowerShell (`pwsh.exe`) executing with the `Set-Service` command and the associated parameters.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Extract and analyze the full command-line arguments for the PowerShell processes identified, paying special attention to any modifications involving the DACL with `-SecurityDescriptorSddl`.
  - **Investigate Service Status:** Use Windows services management tools or commands to check the status and DACL settings of services that have been modified as indicated by the alert, looking for suspicious entries.
  - **Review for Other Indicators:** Search for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) or related suspicious activities in the logs, such as anomalous user behavior or concurrent malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the significant risk posed by unauthorized modifications to service DACLs. Such changes can enable persistent access for attackers, allowing them to evade detection and maintain control over affected systems.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  Certain scenarios may lead to this rule not firing, such as:
  - The use of non-PowerShell methods to modify service DACLs, which would bypass this detection.
  - If an attacker is running PowerShell in a more stealthy manner, possibly obfuscating the command-line arguments, the rule might fail to detect the activity.
  - The rule assumes that the system has PowerShell 7 (or later) available since the specific SDDL flag is not present in earlier versions, which limits its applicability in environments with legacy PowerShell versions.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Execution Of Non-Existing File" aims to detect process creation events where the specified image path is incomplete or malformed, particularly when it doesn’t include a full, absolute path. Malicious actors can leverage techniques like process ghosting, which involves manipulating running processes to hide the actual command being executed. This rule examines process creation logs—specifically, looking for events where the `Image` field fails to include an absolute path and isn’t part of a defined set of known benign processes. This correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion and more specifically the technique for process masquerading. By identifying these irregularities, it allows SOC analysts to notice potentially evasive behavior from threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use the EDR to filter for recent process creation events linked to the alert and look for any instances where the `Image` field lacks a full path. 
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Examine the command-line parameters for the suspicious processes to ascertain if any unusual arguments were provided that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Cross-Reference Known Processes:** Compare the identified processes against known benign processes and applications within the organization to evaluate potential false positives.
  - **Evaluate Network Connections:** Use network monitoring tools to check if the suspicious processes are attempting outgoing connections, which might suggest command and control interactions or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule is assigned a high severity due to the risk associated with processes executing without a valid image path, which may indicate an attempt to evade detection by security controls. The absence of a legitimate executable path further raises concerns about the integrity of the system and potential compromises.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  It is assumed that not all methods of evasion will be detectable using this rule; for instance, more sophisticated threats may be able to execute through correctly named processes or utilize valid paths, thereby evading detection. Furthermore, if an attacker utilizes a legitimate application to create a malicious process, the rule may not trigger. Finally, environments with custom process paths or certain applications that utilize unconventional launching methods may hinder the rule's effectiveness.

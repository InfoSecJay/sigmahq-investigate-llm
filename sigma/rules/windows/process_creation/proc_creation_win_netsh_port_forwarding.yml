  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of `netsh.exe` commands that create new port forwarding rules via the PortProxy feature in Windows. By monitoring process creation events for `netsh.exe`, the rule looks for specific command-line patterns indicating the addition of port forwarding rules, which may signal attempts at lateral movement, command-and-control, or other malicious activities. The relevant technical data sources include the process creation logs, specifically looking for the presence of `netsh.exe` in the process image path and specific keywords in the command-line parameters such as `interface`, `portproxy`, `add`, `connectp`, and `listena`. This rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of lateral movement (T1090), defense evasion, and command and control.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the EDR tool to confirm the execution of `netsh.exe` and examine the parent process ID to establish context around how this command was launched.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Inspect the command-line parameters associated with the `netsh.exe` process to determine the exact port forwarding rules being added and assess their legitimacy.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Use network monitoring tools or logs to observe any active connections that correspond to the newly created port forwarding rules, especially focusing on any unexpected external endpoints.
  - **Review User Context:** Investigate the user account that executed the command by cross-referencing with authentication logs to ensure that it is consistent with legitimate administrative activity or authorized usage.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert holds a medium severity level because while it can indicate legitimate administrative tasks, it may also reveal attempts to create unauthorized network tunnels, which can facilitate lateral movement or command and control operations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire for legitimate administrative actions that are appropriate in certain contexts, such as authorized users setting up WSL2 network bridges or similar configurations. Additionally, if adversaries manipulate the command-line to evade detection, such as using obfuscation techniques or alternate tools, the rule may also fail to trigger. Analysts should be aware that network configurations can vary widely, leading to potential false negatives in environments where such operations are common.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious execution of the `rundll32.exe` process with the `oledb32.dll` library to open Universal Data Link (UDL) files. Often employed by threat actors as a phishing method, this technique can enable the capture of sensitive credentials and data. The rule specifically looks for instances where `rundll32.exe` is initiated by the `explorer.exe` process and attempts to command the loading of `oledb32.dll` with parameters that indicate a file located in a userâ€™s Downloads directory ending with the `.udl` extension. By monitoring the command line syntax for such executions, this rule aims to flag potentially unauthorized access attempts that leverage benign-looking file types for malicious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review EDR logs to trace the execution path of `rundll32.exe` and check for any related processes that were spawned from `explorer.exe`.
  - Use the SIEM to examine alerts for additional context surrounding the execution, such as user accounts involved and the timeline of events leading to the execution.
  - Query proxy logs to identify any outgoing network connections initiated by the process, which may reveal data exfiltration attempts related to the UDL exploitation.
  - Analyze the content of the detected UDL file to determine whether it contains suspicious elements or links that could compromise sensitive information or systems.

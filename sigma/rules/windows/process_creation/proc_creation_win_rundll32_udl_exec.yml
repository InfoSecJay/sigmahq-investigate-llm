  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on monitoring the execution of `rundll32.exe`, specifically when it calls the `oledb32.dll` library to open a UDL (Universal Data Link) file. The use of `rundll32.exe` in this context can indicate potential malicious activity, where threat actors may exploit this technique as a phishing vector to capture sensitive information such as authentication credentials. The rule captures relevant data from process creation logs on Windows systems, examining the command line arguments, parent process (specifically `explorer.exe`), and file paths associated with the execution. By analyzing these elements, the rule aims to detect suspicious behavior that aligns with MITRE ATT&CK techniques, particularly T1218.011 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution) and T1071 (Application Layer Protocol).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs in your EDR solution to identify instances of `rundll32.exe` being executed with the specified command-line parameters, including the use of `oledb32.dll`.
  - **Examine Parent Processes:** Review the parent processes of the detected `rundll32.exe` executions to confirm they are initiated by `explorer.exe`. Look for any anomalies in the parent-child relationships that may suggest tampering or unusual activity.
  - **Analyze UDL File Usage:** Search for the UDL files accessed in the command-line parameters, particularly those located in user download directories. Validate the legitimacy of these files and their intended use cases.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize network detection tools to analyze outbound connections associated with `rundll32.exe` executions. Pay attention to any connections that appear unusual or are directed towards suspicious domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for threat actors to misuse benign tools like `rundll32.exe` for malicious purposes, particularly in capturing sensitive data. Prompt investigation is essential as it may indicate the early stages of an attack vectors that could lead to further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments where `rundll32.exe` is legitimately used to access UDL files, such as in development and administrative tasks. Analysts should consider that threat actors may use obfuscation techniques or rename executables to bypass this detection. Additionally, if users regularly download UDL files for legitimate purposes without raising security flags, the detection might generate false positives. It's important to validate the context around each alert to reduce unnecessary investigations.

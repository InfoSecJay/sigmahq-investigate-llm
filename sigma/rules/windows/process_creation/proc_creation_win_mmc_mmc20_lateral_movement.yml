  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "MMC20 Lateral Movement" is designed to detect potential lateral movement activity utilizing the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) through the component object model (COM). The rule specifically monitors instances where the `mmc.exe` process is spawned by `svchost.exe`, particularly when the command line arguments include "-Embedding". This behavior is indicative of an attacker leveraging legitimate system processes to execute malicious commands without raising immediate red flags. The process creation logs from Windows will be the primary source for this detection, examining the parent-child relationships between processes based on command-line parameters. In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this behavior connects to the "Execution" tactic and the technique T1021.003, which focuses on remote services for lateral movement.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Tree**: Use EDR tools to analyze the process tree and verify if `mmc.exe` was started correctly by `svchost.exe`. Look for unusual parent-child relationships involving these processes.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments**: Inspect the command-line parameters associated with the detected `mmc.exe` execution. Confirm that "-Embedding" is present and investigate any additional parameters for malicious behavior.
  - **Analyze Event Logs**: Query Windows Security and Sysmon logs for any related events that coincide with the timestamps of the suspicious process creation. Look for any authentication attempts or unusual activity around the same time.
  - **Correlate with Network Activities**: Utilize network detection tools to understand if there were any unusual external or internal network calls made during or after the execution of `mmc.exe`. Check for unexpected communication patterns that may suggest lateral movement.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to its potential indication of lateral movement, a critical pivot point for attackers attempting to move deeper into the network and access sensitive resources.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that `mmc.exe` is being executed in a manner typical of lateral movement tactics. It may not fire in environments where legitimate administrative tasks are frequently performed using MMC. Additionally, the rule may fail to detect sophisticated evasion techniques, such as the use of encrypted command lines or process hollowing, that adversaries could employ to conceal their activities.

title: Sensitive File Dump Via Wbadmin.EXE
id: 8b93a509-1cb8-42e1-97aa-ee24224cdc15
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the dump of highly sensitive files such as "NTDS.DIT" and "SECURITY" hive.
  Attackers can leverage the "wbadmin" utility in order to dump sensitive files that might contain credential or sensitive information.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Sensitive File Dump Via Wbadmin.EXE" detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activity where an attacker uses the Windows Backup Utility (wbadmin.exe) to extract sensitive files, such as the NTDS.DIT file and the SECURITY hive, which could contain sensitive credentials or configurations. This attack falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access (T1003.003), where adversaries may seek to obtain user credentials or system configurations to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. The rule primarily analyzes the process creation logs to detect specific command-line arguments that suggest an attempt to create backups of sensitive system files. By monitoring the conditions under which wbadmin operates, the rule provides SOC analysts with essential context to investigate unauthorized attempts to access critical system files.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine logs for any instances of wbadmin.exe executing with command-line arguments related to 'start backup'. Focus on unusual execution patterns or timings that deviate from normal administrative activity.
    
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check the user account associated with the command execution. Verify if the account has legitimate administrative privileges and whether the execution was expected during the observed timeframe.
  - **Utilize EDR Capabilities:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to investigate the behavior of the wbadmin.exe process. Look for any parent processes that might indicate malicious activity, or any attempts to establish persistence.
  - **Analyze Backup Operations:** Inspect any backup operations conducted by wbadmin.exe in the context of your organization's policies. Ensure that any legitimate operations are documented and cross-reference them with potential false positive alerts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to the potential catastrophic consequences of unauthorized access to sensitive files, which could lead to credential theft or system compromise in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One major blind spot of this rule is the possibility of legitimate administrative users performing backups, which could trigger false positives. The rule assumes that all executions of wbadmin.exe need to be scrutinized unless pre-approved. Additionally, if an adversary removes or renames wbadmin.exe or leverages a different method or tool to extract sensitive files, the detection may fail. Understanding these variables can help detection engineers assess the effectiveness and limitations of the rule in real-world scenarios.

  Detects execution of "tar.exe" in order to create a compressed file.
  Adversaries may abuse various utilities to compress or encrypt data before exfiltration.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of `tar.exe`, specifically when it is used to create a compressed file during potential malicious activity. The detection is focused on process creation logs from Windows, analyzing indicators such as the image path and command-line arguments. Adversaries often utilize standard utilities like `tar.exe` to compress or encrypt sensitive data prior to exfiltration, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for Collection (T1560) and Exfiltration (T1560.001). By capturing process creation events with specific parameters, this rule aims to identify instances where adversaries may be employing `tar.exe` as part of their data exfiltration techniques.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR for `tar.exe` instances, including timestamps, user accounts, and parent processes to identify any suspicious activity leading to its execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters used with `tar.exe`, focusing on flags like `-c`, `-r`, and `-u`, which indicate file creation and modification actions that could signify malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use network traffic logs to determine if any outbound connections were made following the execution of `tar.exe`, indicating potential data exfiltration efforts.
  - **Review File System Changes:** Check Windows file system logs for the creation or modification of files in proximity to the execution of `tar.exe`, especially any unexpected or unauthorized file paths.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a low severity level because while the execution of `tar.exe` may indicate benign activity in many contexts, it can also signify potential malicious actions depending on the circumstances and users involved. Analysts should prioritize alerts based on additional context and indicators of compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if adversaries use a different compression utility or if `tar.exe` is executed with benign command-line parameters by authorized users or applications. Additionally, legitimate backups or system administration tasks could create false positives. It's essential to note that skilled adversaries may modify command-line arguments to evade detection, and therefore reliance solely on this rule may result in undetected malicious activity.

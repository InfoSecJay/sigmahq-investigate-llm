status: test
description: |
  Detects uncommon child processes spawning from "sigverif.exe", which could indicate potential abuse of the latter as a living of the land binary in order to proxy execution.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies uncommon child processes that are spawned from "sigverif.exe", a legitimate Microsoft tool that verifies digital signatures on Windows files. The rule targets process creation events (monitored via Windows Sysmon logs), specifically looking for any child processes initiated by "sigverif.exe" as a parent. The behavior of concern is that threat actors may misuse "sigverif.exe" as a "living off the land" binary to evade standard security controls and proxy execution of malicious activities. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1216 (Script Proxying) under the defense evasion tactic, as it leverages legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review Sysmon logs for any unusual child processes spawned by "sigverif.exe." Pay attention to command-line arguments that could indicate suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Parent-Child Process Relationships:** Use EDR tools to visualize the process tree, determining if the triggered alert involves known malicious processes or benign tools being misused.
  - **Check for Known Signatures:** Verify if the child processes match known malicious signatures via your enterprise AV or threat intelligence capabilities across environment endpoints.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Look into user accounts that initiated "sigverif.exe" to ascertain if they follow standard operating procedures or exhibit anomalous behavior relative to typical work patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule should be considered medium severity. This is due to the risk posed by the potential misuse of a legitimate executable that may facilitate other malicious actions while easing detection by conventional security monitoring systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if "sigverif.exe" is not present on a system or if the child processes created do not match the specific conditions of the rule. It operates under the assumption that the monitoring for process creation using Sysmon is fully operational and logs are intact. Threat actors may also attempt to evade detection by modifying the signature of child processes or by using alternative execution methods that do not involve "sigverif.exe".

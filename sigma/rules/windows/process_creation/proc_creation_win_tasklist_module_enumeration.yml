title: Loaded Module Enumeration Via Tasklist.EXE
id: 34275eb8-fa19-436b-b959-3d9ecd53fa1f
status: test
description: |
  Detects the enumeration of a specific DLL or EXE being used by a binary via "tasklist.exe".
  This is often used by attackers in order to find the specific process identifier (PID) that is using the DLL in question.
  In order to dump the process memory or perform other nefarious actions.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Loaded Module Enumeration Via Tasklist.EXE" is designed to detect when an attacker uses the `tasklist.exe` utility to enumerate loaded modules within processes on a Windows system. This activity is often carried out by malicious actors to identify specific process identifiers (PIDs) associated with a DLL or executable, such as `rdpcorets.dll`, which could subsequently be targeted for memory dumping or other exploitation techniques. The rule analyzes the process creation logs, focusing on the use of `tasklist.exe`. It looks for command-line arguments that indicate the enumeration of modules, specifically monitoring for the presence of the `-m` flag which denotes the request for module information. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Credential Access" (T1003), which encompasses techniques for obtaining sensitive information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Windows Event Logs for entries related to `tasklist.exe`. Investigate the command-line arguments to confirm if the `-m` switch was used alongside references to `rdpcorets.dll`.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to review the behavior and activities of processes that were active around the same time as the detected execution of `tasklist.exe`. Look for any unusual process interactions or memory access.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Analyze firewall and proxy logs to see if there were any outbound connections or suspicious activities that begin around the time of the `tasklist.exe` execution. This could indicate further malicious actions post-enumeration.
  - **Examine User Activity:** Identify the user account that executed the `tasklist.exe` command. Verify whether this user has legitimate reasons for running this command or if their activity appears out of norm for their role within the organization.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert indicates a potential technique used by attackers to prepare for further exploitation, it is considered medium severity. Timely investigation is essential to understand the context and intent of the activity, as it may lead to credential compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Detection may not trigger under the following circumstances: if the process name is obfuscated, if attackers utilize alternative methods for module enumeration (e.g., PowerShell scripts), or if `tasklist.exe` is modified or executed in an unusual manner that bypasses standard logging. Additionally, it assumes that monitoring for process creation on the endpoints is enabled and functioning correctly. Analysts should consider that not all legitimate uses of `tasklist.exe` may be malicious, and further context is necessary to draw conclusions.

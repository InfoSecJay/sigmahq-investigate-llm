  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potentially malicious activity associated with the use of `sqlcmd.exe`, a command-line utility for SQL Server. Specifically, it aims to identify attempts to dump database credentials from the "VeeamBackup" database through SQL queries that include the keywords 'SELECT', 'TOP', and target the `dbo.Credentials` table. The primary data sources utilized in this detection are the process creation logs from Windows, particularly watching the command-line parameters executed by `sqlcmd.exe`. By flagging such activity, this rule helps organizations detect a method that could be employed by adversaries to harvest sensitive credentials, correlating with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1005 (Data from Local System).
  ### Investigation Steps  
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Examine the Windows process creation logs for instances of `sqlcmd.exe` execution that match the identified command-line parameters. Pay special attention to the parent process to understand the context of execution.
  - **Check for Anomalous Patterns:** Investigate if the timing or frequency of the detected events aligns with normal user behavior or scheduled tasks for database access. Compare against established baselines to flag potential suspicious activity.
  - **Validate User Accounts:** Identify the user account associated with the command execution and review their permissions and roles in relation to the VeeamBackup database. Ensure that they should have access to query sensitive data like credentials.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Tools:** Utilize EDR tools to check for additional malicious indicators on the host where the command was executed. Look for related alerts in AV, proxy logs, or unusual network connections post-event.
  ### Prioritization
  An alert from this rule is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of credential exposure, which can significantly compromise database security and lead to further exploitation within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire if the usage of `sqlcmd.exe` is masked by an approved application or a script with elevated permissions. It assumes that adequate logging is enabled on the Windows environment to capture detailed command-line arguments. Additionally, users with legitimate needs or processes that utilize similar command-line patterns may result in false positives, making it essential to adaptively refine detection thresholds.

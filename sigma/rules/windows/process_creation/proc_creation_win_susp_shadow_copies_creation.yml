  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies activities related to the creation of shadow copies in a Windows environment using various operating system utilities such as PowerShell, WMIC, and VSSADMIN. Shadow copies are backup snapshots that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, hence their creation may indicate potential credential access incidents. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the executed commands contain key parameters such as "shadow" and "create," signaling attempts to initiate shadow copy operations. Key log sources for this detection include process creation logs and command line activity, offering valuable insights into user behavior and potential security threats.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Use EDR tools to review the process creation logs and identify instances of `powershell.exe`, `wmic.exe`, or `vssadmin.exe` being executed, paying special attention to the command line parameters used during execution.
  - Cross-reference the identified events with user accounts to determine if they belong to legitimate administrative personnel or if thereâ€™s suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.
  - Examine network logs (NDR and proxy) to identify any unusual outbound connections from the host that executed the shadow copy commands, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts.
  - Check cloud logs in AWS, GCP, or Azure to ascertain if any automated backup processes or shadow copy applications have been recently altered or inappropriately accessed.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the use of operating system utilities for the creation of shadow copies, specifically through tools such as PowerShell, WMIC, and VSSADMIN. The crucial element here is that these commands may indicate an attempt to access sensitive information, such as credentials, by creating a copy of the system state or the Active Directory database. The rule inspects logs related to process creation within the Windows environment, focusing on command lines that contain keywords like "shadow" and "create." This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access, specifically techniques T1003.002 (OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager) and T1003.003 (OS Credential Dumping: NTDS). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize the EDR's process creation logs to identify processes that triggered this alert, focusing on any associated parent processes and their command-line arguments.
  - **Inspect Command Execution Timing:** Correlate the alert timing with recent administrative actions or scheduled tasks to determine whether legitimate activities could explain the command execution.
  - **Analyze Event Logs:** Check the Windows Security event logs for any prior authentication events related to compromised credentials, which may indicate an escalation attempt or suspicious activity.
  - **Check for Other Red Flags:** Utilize the SIEM to identify any additional lateral movement or credential misuse behavior occurring within the same timeframe as the shadow copy creation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level as it may indicate potential credential harvesting activities, which could lead to further compromise if not investigated promptly. Given the ease of creating shadow copies, even legitimate actions can mask malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where the defensive posture is weak or incident response processes are not actively monitoring unauthorized shadow copy creation. Additionally, legitimate administrator activities focused on backup processes may lead to false positives, highlighting the need for additional context in investigations. Adversaries can also decrease the likelihood of detection by utilizing legitimate administrative tools at non-peak times or disguising such activities under routine maintenance operations.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors the invocation of `query.exe`, a native Windows command-line utility utilized to enumerate sessions and processes. By looking for commands that direct output to files using `session >` or `process >`, the rule identifies possible exfiltration attempts where an adversary could exploit legitimate processes to gather sensitive information about system activity. The rule specifically leverages process creation logs from Windows to capture events with the specified command lines and image paths. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (T1203), identifying how adversaries may misuse built-in tools to achieve their goals without raising immediate suspicion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review EDR for any associated alerts indicative of suspicious activity surrounding the `query.exe` execution, including the process tree and any parent processes for context.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command line arguments for the occurrence of `session >` or `process >`. Understanding what information was requested could provide insights into the extent of potential exfiltration.
  - **Review System Logs:** Examine Windows Security and System logs for any relevant events that correlate with the timing of the detected `query.exe` invocation, helping to establish a timeline of events.
  - **Correlate with Proxy Logs:** Cross-reference any network activity associated with the same user or system that executed `query.exe`, checking for any outbound connections that may indicate data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert for this rule is considered medium severity due to the potentially critical nature of exfiltrating system information. While not inherently malicious, the usage of `query.exe` in a manner consistent with information gathering should prompt further investigation into the user's context and activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that `query.exe` is being invoked legitimately or in an unauthorized context. There may be scenarios where administrative activities involving `query.exe` occur without any malicious intent, leading to false positives. Moreover, if an adversary uses alternative methods or scripting to perform similar activities, or if they rename the executable, the rule may fail to detect unauthorized access to sensitive system data.

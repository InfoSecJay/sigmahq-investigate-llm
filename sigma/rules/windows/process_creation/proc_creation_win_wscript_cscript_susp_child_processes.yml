title: Cscript/Wscript Potentially Suspicious Child Process
id: b6676963-0353-4f88-90f5-36c20d443c6a
status: test
description: |
  Detects potentially suspicious child processes of Wscript/Cscript. These include processes such as rundll32 with uncommon exports or PowerShell spawning rundll32 or regsvr32.
  Malware such as Pikabot and Qakbot were seen using similar techniques as well as many others.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially suspicious child processes spawned by the Windows script hosts `wscript.exe` and `cscript.exe`. It specifically looks for scenarios where these host processes initiate command-line interface (CLI) scripts, such as `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`, and then leverage other commonly abused executables, like `rundll32.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, or `msiexec.exe`. The rule flags instances where these processes are created, especially when they possess uncommon exports or are executed in unusual contexts. This behavior has been linked to malware such as Pikabot and Qakbot, which utilize similar techniques to execute malicious payloads covertly. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic is "Execution," with techniques focusing on script execution and command-line misuse.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Source Process:** Check the process tree to confirm that the parent process is either `wscript.exe` or `cscript.exe`, ensuring the detection aligns with the intended criteria.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line parameters of any detected child processes for suspicious content, particularly for indications of abnormal behavior (e.g., HTTP requests or uncommon parameters).
  - **Examine Known Libraries:** For instances involving `rundll32.exe`, review whether the executed exports fall within the known benign list to differentiate legitimate use from potentially malicious activities.
  - **Consult Security Tools for Threat Intelligence:** Use EDR and AV solutions to check the reputation of the involved processes and their parent-child relationships to correlate with existing threat intelligence.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for exploitation of scripting mechanisms by adversaries to achieve code execution, which can lead to further compromises or data exfiltration.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate administrative scripts frequently utilize `wscript` or `cscript`, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, if an adversary obfuscates their command lines to evade detection or utilizes processes and methods not covered by the rule, the detection may fail. It is also assumed that script execution from these hosts typically follows a predictable pattern, which can be disrupted by custom scripts or tools used by administrators.

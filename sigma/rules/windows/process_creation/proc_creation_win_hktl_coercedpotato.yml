  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - CoercedPotato Execution" is designed to detect the execution of a well-known privilege escalation tool named CoercedPotato. This tool exploits specific vulnerabilities in Windows authentication mechanisms, allowing malicious actors to elevate privileges on compromised systems. The rule primarily focuses on identifying the process creation events associated with the execution of CoercedPotato. It specifically looks for the presence of the executable `CoercedPotato.exe`, monitors the command-line parameters for `--exploitId`, and matches specific import hashes related to the binary. The key data sources involved include Windows process creation logs generated by Sysmon or the Windows Security log. By detecting these indicators, the rule assists in identifying possibly malicious use of this tool within the enterprise. The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics include "Defense Evasion" and "Privilege Escalation," specifically technique T1055.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Investigate the process creation logs for entries related to `CoercedPotato.exe`, paying special attention to the timing and parent processes of the execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Check the command-line parameters used with CoercedPotato, particularly looking for the `--exploitId` argument, to understand the exploit being leveraged.
  - **Investigate Related Processes**: Use your EDR solution to monitor for any processes that were initiated by `CoercedPotato.exe`, identifying any potential lateral movement or further escalation attempts.
  - **Search for Import Hash Matches**: Utilize hash analysis tools to identify occurrences of the specific `IMPHASH` values associated with CoercedPotato within your environment, revealing any unauthorized or suspicious deployments of the tool.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this rule has a high severity level given the potential for the CoercedPotato tool to escalate privileges, which can lead to significant security breaches if not promptly addressed in the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule assumes that all relevant logging is enabled and configured correctly to capture process creation events, which may not always be the case in every environment. Furthermore, if adversaries modify the process name or evade detection by using similar binaries, the rule may fail to fire. Additionally, environments with customized security configurations or restricted access may also overlook legitimate uses of this tool, leading to false positives.

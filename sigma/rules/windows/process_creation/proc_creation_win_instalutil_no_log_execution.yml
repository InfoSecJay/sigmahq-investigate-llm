  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious Execution of InstallUtil Without Log" detects the execution of the .NET InstallUtil.exe without generating a log file. InstallUtil is a legitimate tool used to install and run applications, but attackers may use it to execute malicious payloads without leaving a trace. This rule analyzes process creation logs, specifically looking for instances where the InstallUtil.exe binary is invoked with the command-line parameters '/logfile=' (indicating no log file is specified) and '/LogToConsole=false' (preventing output from being displayed). By inspecting the process creation events, the rule aims to identify potentially malicious usage of InstallUtil that falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Defense Evasion (T1562), where adversaries try to hide their activities from security monitoring.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs for process creation events (Event ID 4688) involving InstallUtil.exe to identify the user context and the originating process.
  - **Examine Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line arguments passed to InstallUtil.exe to verify if they match the suspicious patterns defining the rule (i.e., '/logfile=' and '/LogToConsole=false').
  - **Review Associated Network Activity:** Use EDR tools to assess any network connections that might have occurred following the execution of InstallUtil.exe, looking for indicators of command and control (C2) communication.
  - **Analyze User Behavior:** Correlate the user account that executed InstallUtil with historical behavioral patterns; look for unusual or unauthorized actions that could indicate a compromised account.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because unauthorized use of InstallUtil can signify that an adversary is attempting to run malicious code stealthily. While it may not always indicate immediate danger, it warrants prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There may be instances where legitimate processes use InstallUtil without generating logs if the execution is part of a compliance or maintenance task. Additionally, the rule may not fire if the command line is obfuscated or if the execution is executed through another parent process that alters the expected parameters. Adversaries could also replace or alter InstallUtil to avoid detection. It's crucial for engineers to be aware that various system configurations, user privileges, or endpoint security settings might affect detection efficacy.

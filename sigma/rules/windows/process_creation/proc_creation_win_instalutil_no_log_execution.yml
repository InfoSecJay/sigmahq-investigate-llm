  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious executions of the `InstallUtil.exe` application in Windows environments. `InstallUtil.exe` is a tool primarily used for installing and uninstalling applications that are built using .NET Framework. This rule specifically looks for command-line executions of `InstallUtil.exe` that do not generate logs, as indicated by the presence of the parameters `/logfile= ` and `/LogToConsole=false`. The absence of intended logging makes such executions concerning, as they can be employed by attackers to run malicious applications without maintaining detailed records, effectively evading detection.
  To facilitate this detection, the rule primarily monitors process creation logs from Windows systems. It checks for instances where the image ends with `InstallUtil.exe` and is located within the .NET Framework installation path. By focusing on command-line arguments that suppress logging, the rule helps flag potentially malicious activities that can lead to further compromises within the environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the process creation logs for occurrences of `InstallUtil.exe`. Pay attention to the timestamps and the parent processes that initiated these executions.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Parameters:** Check the command-line arguments associated with the instances of `InstallUtil.exe`. Confirm whether the `/logfile= ` and `/LogToConsole=false` flags were used to ensure thereâ€™s no legitimate logging method active.
  - **Correlate with User Activities:** Examine user activity logs to identify whether the execution aligns with typical user behavior or scheduled tasks. Evaluate whether the executing user had legitimate reasons for using `InstallUtil.exe`.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** If applicable, leverage NDR or firewall logs to detect any outbound connections made around the time of the suspicious execution. Look for connections to known malicious IPs or domains that could indicate a larger compromise.

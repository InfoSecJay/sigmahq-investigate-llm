  ### Technical Context
  The PDQ Deploy Remote Administration Tool Detection rule is designed to identify the execution of the PDQ Deploy console on Windows systems. This tool is commonly used for software deployment and remote management within corporate environments. The rule focuses on the detection of process creation events where the `PDQDeployConsole.exe` executable is invoked. By capturing logs specifically from the Windows Process Creation events, the rule can trigger alerts when this executable is launched, which may imply that an administrator or potentially an adversary is using remote capabilities to install or manage software across the network. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic of Execution (ATT&CK ID: T1072) and is relevant to the Lateral Movement technique, where attackers use administrative tools to spread within a network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Context of Use:** Check the user and system context under which the PDQ Deploy console was executed. Cross-reference with normal operating hours and recent administrative activities to determine if the invocation was legitimate.
  - **Monitor for Related Activity:** Utilize the EDR and Sysmon logs to review any additional processes that were executed shortly before or after the PDQ Deploy Console execution, as this may indicate suspicious behavior or lateral movement by an adversary.
  - **Check for Anomalies in Deployment Schedule:** Review the deployment history in PDQ Deploy for consistency. Investigate any recent deployments that deviate from standard system management practices or involve sensitive systems.
  - **Assess Network Activities:** Analyze network connection logs for any unusual outgoing or incoming traffic related to the systems involved, particularly looking for unauthorized access attempts or suspicious communication patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity as the legitimate use of PDQ Deploy can often lead to critical administrative actions. However, its use can also indicate potential malicious activity, warranting investigation into the context and circumstances of the detected execution.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if PDQ Deploy is executed through obfuscated methods or if the process is renamed or altered (e.g., through copy or renaming of the executable). Additionally, if the deployment occurs through another remote management tool that does not utilize the specified executable name, it may not be detected. The assumptions here include that the environment will have PDQ Deploy installed and logging enabled properly, and that sufficient baseline knowledge exists regarding normal administrative activities to identify genuine threats.

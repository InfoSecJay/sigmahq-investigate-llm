  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of `pcwrun.exe`, which leverages the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) to initiate indirect command execution. The rule specifically looks for processes that are created with command-line arguments that include the string `../`, a potential indicator of directory traversal often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts or commands. By monitoring the `process_creation` logs, the rule captures relevant data about any process that involves `pcwrun.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows utility but can be weaponized in the context of exploiting vulnerabilities. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of [Defense Evasion (T1203)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/) and [Execution (T1218)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/) as it highlights attempts to bypass security controls and execute commands covertly.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Inspect EDR Alerts:** Check for any recent alerts associated with `pcwrun.exe` in the EDR solution to gather context about the process and its parent processes.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize Sysmon or Windows Security logs to analyze the command line history linked to the execution of `pcwrun.exe`, focusing on entries with `../` in their arguments.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to assess any outbound network connections made by the affected systems around the time `pcwrun.exe` was executed to identify potential data exfiltration or communication with known malicious servers.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Examine the relevant user activity logs (like VPN or Proxy) to understand if the `pcwrun.exe` execution correlates with unusual access patterns or behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered high severity due to its association with known exploitation techniques that can be used to bypass security measures and execute commands on target systems, potentially leading to further compromise within the enterprise network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may fail to fire in environments where `pcwrun.exe` is legitimately used for benign purposes, such as application compatibility. Additionally, sophisticated attackers might obfuscate their command-line arguments or use entirely different executables to achieve similar outcomes, bypassing this specific detection. It is assumed that the telemetry from process creations is correctly configured and that log collection systems are monitoring `pcwrun.exe` effectively.

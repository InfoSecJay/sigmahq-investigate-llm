  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Firewall Configuration Discovery Via Netsh.EXE" is designed to detect potential adversary behavior during information discovery phases, specifically targeting network configuration and firewall settings. The rule identifies the use of the Windows command-line utility `netsh.exe`, which can be leveraged by adversaries to reveal detailed firewall rules, configuration settings, and other network-related information. By monitoring process creation events and analyzing the command-line parameters associated with `netsh.exe`, this detection rule flags instances where the command is used specifically to display firewall configurations or rules. 
  The key technical data sources for this detection include process creation logs that provide insight into executed commands, as well as the command-line parameters given to `netsh.exe`. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique associated with this rule is T1016 ("System Network Configuration Discovery"), which addresses the methods adversaries might use to understand network configurations in their targeted environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Examine alerts from the EDR for any instances of `netsh.exe` being executed with command-line parameters related to firewall configurations. Investigate the process context and user account associated with the execution.
    
  - **Analyze Windows Security Logs:** Check Windows Security Event Logs for corresponding event IDs (such as 4688) that indicate the creation of processes by suspicious user accounts or system accounts and correlate them with the time of the detected `netsh.exe` execution.
  - **Check for Administrative Activity:** Determine if the flagged execution of `netsh.exe` can be attributed to legitimate administrative activity, such as monitoring or troubleshooting network configurations. Review any recent change requests or system maintenance activities.
  - **Investigate Network Connections:** Use network logs (from NDR or Firewall) to track if there are any unusual outbound connections from the system performing the discovery, which may indicate further malicious activity following the information gathering process.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as low severity primarily because the usage of `netsh.exe` can often be legitimate, such as during routine administrative tasks. However, it warrants investigation to ensure that it is not being abused by an adversary for reconnaissance purposes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `netsh.exe` is executed in a non-standard way that does not match the defined command-line patterns or if the adversary uses alternative methods for network configuration discovery. Additionally, if logging is inadequate or disabled on the system, or if the command is executed in a non-Windows environment, the detection may not occur. It is assumed that vigilant monitoring of administrative activities will assist in differentiating between legitimate and malicious use cases.

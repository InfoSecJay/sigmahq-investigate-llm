  ### Technical Context
  The "Cloudflared Tunnel Connections Cleanup" detection rule is designed to identify unauthorized or suspicious executions of the Cloudflared tool, specifically when it is used with the "tunnel cleanup" command. This command is intended to remove tunnel connections, and its presence can indicate potential nefarious activity such as an attacker attempting to sever VPN connections or hide indicators of compromise. By monitoring the process creation logs, particularly focusing on command-line parameters that contain both "tunnel" and "cleanup" along with the presence of configuration flags, this rule is able to trigger alerts when it detects potentially malicious usage. The detection is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques of command and control (T1102), other operations that involve tunneling techniques (T1090), and legitimate cloud services (T1572).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check the Process Details:** Use your EDR tool to query the process creation logs for "cloudflared" executions, particularly with the noted command parameters. Identify the user and process context to determine if the execution is legitimate.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line arguments associated with the event. Ensure they align with expected usage scenarios and check for unexpected arguments that might indicate misuse.
  - **Review User Activity:** Analyze the logs from the user account initiating the command to see if there are any prior suspicious activities or unusual behavior that could suggest malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Cross-reference the firewall and network logs to check for any unusual outbound connections or tunneling activity that could suggest data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because while the "cleanup" command could be legitimate in certain contexts, its execution warrants further investigation due to the potential for misuse in obscuring malicious activity, particularly in a cloud-enabled environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the command is executed without the specified parameters or if the command-line flags are altered to avoid detection. Additionally, if the EDR or the monitoring tools do not capture process creation events accurately, potential instances may go unnoticed. It assumes that any legitimate use of the Cloudflared tool has been vetted and that other user activity is benign, which might not always be the case.

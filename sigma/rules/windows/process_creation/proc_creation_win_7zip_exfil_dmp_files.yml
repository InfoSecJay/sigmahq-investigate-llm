  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the execution of the 7-Zip utility (7z.exe, 7zr.exe, 7za.exe) specifically when it is used to compress files with the extensions ".dmp", ".dump", or ".hdmp". The rationale behind this detection is that these dump files often contain sensitive information, and their compression may be a precursor to exfiltration efforts by malicious actors. The rule inspects process creation logs, focusing on the command-line parameters used when launching 7-Zip. By doing so, it identifies potential instances where a user or process is attempting to compress and obfuscate dump files, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic related to data collection (technique T1560.001). 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Investigate the process creation details in EDR for the detected instance of `7z.exe`, including parent processes and command-line arguments to understand the context of execution.
    
  - **Review File Activity:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to examine file access and creation events associated with the compressed files to determine if any suspicious behavior, such as transfer to external locations, occurred.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Inspect network connection logs and proxy logs to verify if there are any unusual outbound connections that coincide with the execution of the 7-Zip command involving dump files.
  - **Solicit User Context:** If applicable, consult with the user associated with the process to ascertain whether the use of 7-Zip on dump files was authorized and in line with their role responsibilities.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for mass data exfiltration stemming from the compression of sensitive dump files, alarmingly so when unassociated with legitimate administrative activities. 
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in cases where legitimate administrative use of 7-Zip occurs for non-malicious reasons, such as troubleshooting or error reporting. Additionally, if adversaries use a different, less common tool to perform similar actions or rename legitimate binaries, it may evade detection. Analysts should also consider scenarios where 7-Zip is invoked with command-line arguments that do not include the suspicious file extensions but still result in sensitive data handling.

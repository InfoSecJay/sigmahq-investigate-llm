  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tunneling via Secure Shell (SSH) on Windows systems. It identifies the execution of `ssh.exe` with command-line arguments containing instances of `:3389`, which is the default port for RDP. The rule primarily leverages process creation logs to monitor for specific patterns indicating possible unauthorized tunneling activities. By monitoring the execution of the `ssh.exe` binary alongside its command-line parameters, the rule aims to flag instances where SSH may be used to create a tunnel for RDP traffic, posing serious security risks as it could facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive internal resources. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique known as "T1572 
  - Protocol Tunneling," falling under the "Command-and-Control" tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process:** Check the process creation logs in Windows Event Logs or your EDR solution for instances of `ssh.exe` being executed, particularly looking at the command-line arguments used.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize network detection tools (NDR) to examine traffic patterns to ensure no unauthorized tunneling to external hosts is initiated over port 3389 after `ssh.exe` execution.
  - **Examine User Context:** Review who executed the command by checking the user context associated with the process in the security logs to evaluate if the user has legitimate permission to create such tunnels.
  - **Review Related Events:** Search for additional events related to RDP or SSH in your logs, such as logins to RDP sessions and other SSH activities, to determine if there are patterns indicative of malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high priority due to the potential for significant security breaches that may arise from unauthorized RDP tunneling. Given the possible ramifications for data exfiltration and lateral movement within the network, prompt investigation is critical.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are known assumptions related to this rule's effectiveness. Legitimate use of SSH for managing servers may generate false positives, and the effectiveness of this detection is reliant on proper logging configurations in place for process creation events. It is also possible that adversaries could use obfuscation techniques to hide their use of `ssh.exe`, thwarting the detection mechanism. Additionally, environments with strict control over outbound RDP access may have reduced efficacy in detecting tunneling.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential malicious activity indicating the execution of a web shell from the ScreenConnect server process (`ScreenConnect.Service.exe`). It works by monitoring Windows process creation events and analyzing the parent-child relationship between processes. Specifically, the rule looks for instances where the parent process is the ScreenConnect service executable (`ScreenConnect.Service.exe`), and the created child processes are command-line interpreters such as `cmd.exe` or `csc.exe`. Since web shells are often utilized by attackers for remote access and command execution, this rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Initial Access (T1190), focusing on possible exploitation vectors that leverage legitimate software like ScreenConnect.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Parent Process Context**: Use EDR tools to examine the parent-child relationship of the flagged process to understand the context in which the child process was created.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Review the command-line parameters associated with the identified `cmd.exe` or `csc.exe` instances for indications of unauthorized attempts to execute commands or scripts.
  - **Review Access and Invocation**: Look into the user accounts that triggered the unusual behavior, assessing their roles and permissions to determine whether the activity was authorized or indicative of compromise.
  - **Cross-Reference with Logs**: Investigate Windows Security logs, Sysmon events, and network traffic logs to see if there were any unusual inbound connections or data exfiltration associated with the flagged activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to its association with potential exploitation of a legitimate remote access tool, which could enable unauthorized remote control over systems, resulting in data loss or further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not detect all instances of web shell activity, especially if an adversary utilizes techniques to obfuscate their actions or if legitimate users are misusing the ScreenConnect application. Additionally, if the command execution is performed in a manner that does not utilize `cmd.exe` or `csc.exe`, the rule may fail to fire. An assumption is that the environments using the ScreenConnect tool will have consistent process naming and behavior patterns, which could vary in misconfigured or heavily customized deployments.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially suspicious executions of `regsvr32.exe`, a Windows tool used for registering and unregistering DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries). The rule specifically looks for instances where `regsvr32.exe` is executed from unusual directories, such as `%TEMP%`, `%PROGRAMDATA%`, or user-specific directories like `%APPDATA%`. These locations can often be exploited by attackers to bypass application whitelisting and execute malicious DLLs under the guise of legitimate processes. The detection leverages process creation logs, focusing on the image name and command line parameters to filter out entries that originate from these potentially suspicious folders. This methodology aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically the technique T1218.010.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Logs**: Investigate the EDR for additional context on the processes observed, looking for parent-child relationships and other related actions that occurred around the same time as the detected execution.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments**: Analyze the command-line parameters associated with the `regsvr32.exe` execution for any unusual DLL names or execution flags that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with Event Logs**: Cross-reference Windows Security and Application Event Logs for any related security events (like user logins and file modifications) that might suggest context to the suspicious execution.
  - **Assess Network Activity**: Examine network connection logs tied to the system where the execution occurred. Look for any outgoing requests to suspicious domains that may correlate with the use of `regsvr32.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is categorized as medium due to the potential risks associated with the execution of `regsvr32.exe` from suspicious locations, which could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures or run unauthorized code on enterprise systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if `regsvr32.exe` is executed from approved directories or if the DLLs are legitimately signed and belong to trusted applications, potentially leading to false negatives. Additionally, adversaries could rename the executables or utilize alternate methods to launch `regsvr32.exe`, effectively evading detection. It is assumed that all relevant telemetry sources, especially related to process creation and command-line execution, are properly logged and monitored.

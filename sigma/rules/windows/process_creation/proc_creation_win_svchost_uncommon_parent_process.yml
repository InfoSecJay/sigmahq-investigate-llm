  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Uncommon Svchost Parent Process" is designed to detect instances where the Windows service host process (svchost.exe) is launched with an atypical parent process. The rule specifically looks for svchost.exe processes whose parent processes do not align with known, legitimate executable names like `Mrt.exe`, `MsMpEng.exe`, `ngen.exe`, `rpcnet.exe`, `services.exe`, or `TiWorker.exe`. This can indicate potential malicious activity, including the use of evasion techniques that leverage commonly used system processes for executing unauthorized code. The primary data sources utilized in this rule are derived from Windows process creation logs, which provide detailed insights into process relationships, enabling identification of anomalies in process hierarchies. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the associated technique T1036.005 (AppCert DLL Search Order Hijacking), highlighting the significance of monitoring the execution environment for potentially malicious parent-child process relationships.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Relationships**: Use an EDR solution to analyze the process tree for the detected svchost.exe instance, ensuring to correlate its parent and child processes.
  - **Check Event Logs**: Review Windows Event Logs, specifically focusing on security logs for any unusual logon attempts or other alerts associated with the parent process identified.
  - **Conduct Network Analysis**: Investigate any associated network connections using NDR tools to identify lateral movement or callback attempts that may indicate data exfiltration or Command and Control (C2) communications.
  - **Assess File Integrity**: Analyze file attributes and integrity for the svchost.exe and its parent process, cross-referencing known good signatures and checking for recent modifications or unusual file paths.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity due to the potential for abuse of legitimate Windows services, which may indicate sophisticated attacks or attempts to evade detection. The presence of svchost.exe launched by an uncommon parent process necessitates thorough investigation to rule out genuine incidents.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are instances where this rule may not fire, particularly if the malicious process uses a legitimate parent executable not covered in the defined filter. Additionally, it assumes that no adjustments to Windows services are made in response to known vulnerabilities, which could obscure the detection capabilities. Furthermore, persistent malicious activity may attempt to disguise itself further by reverting to known good configurations, making detection challenging for this particular rule.

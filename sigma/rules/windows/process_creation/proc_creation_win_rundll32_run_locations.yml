  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Process Start Locations" detection rule is designed to identify the execution of processes originating from atypical or unwanted directories within a Windows environment. Specifically, the rule focuses on process creation logs to track applications launching from known suspicious directories such as `'C:\Windows\Tasks\'`, `'C:\Windows\debug\'`, and other paths that are generally not associated with legitimate application execution. It also checks for executables running from locations like `':\RECYCLER\'` or `':\SystemVolumeInformation\'`, which may suggest attempts to evade security controls. The primary data source leveraged for this detection is the Windows Process Creation logs, which capture relevant details such as image names and paths. This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Defense Evasion" (T1036), which involves adversaries manipulating executable environments to obscure their activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tool for any additional alerts or context regarding the process identified. Examine the reputation of the executable path and any associated behaviors or indicators of compromise.
    
  - **Review Parent Processes:** Investigate the parent processes associated with the alerts to determine how they invoked the suspicious process. This could yield insight into how the process was initiated and whether it is linked to other known malicious activity.
    
  - **Correlate with Security Logs:** Utilize Windows Security and Sysmon logs to analyze the time of the suspicious invocation. Look for logs that capture user logins and any relevant access patterns to the directories in question.
    
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Look for related network connections from the identified process using network detection tools. Anomalies in outbound traffic can provide additional context on the potential actions taken by the process.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium priority since processes running from unusual locations can indicate potential malicious activity. However, false positives may occur due to administrative actions or legitimate scripts being executed from these locations.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger in scenarios where malicious processes are executed from typical or legitimate directories, thus bypassing detection. Additionally, power users or administrators might frequently use the identified paths for legitimate purposes, potentially leading to noise in alerts. It's also assumed that environments strictly adhere to standard Windows configurations, and any deviations may require additional rule calibration or tuning to ensure comprehensive coverage.

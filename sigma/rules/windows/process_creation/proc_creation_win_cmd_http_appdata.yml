  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of suspicious command lines that incorporate both a URL and the AppData string in their parameters, which is a common tactic employed by various droppers, particularly those leveraging PowerShell to download and execute malicious payloads. The rule specifically looks for processes initiated by `cmd.exe`, where the command line contains an HTTP(s) URL and references the `%AppData%` environment variable. This combination can indicate potential command-and-control (C2) behavior or the execution of malicious scripts that reside within the user's AppData directory. The primary technical sources utilized for this detection are process creation logs, specifically those recorded via Sysmon, which provide detailed insights into command execution, including command lines and parent process information. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as T1059 for scripting, T1105 for remote file transfer, and T1059.001 for PowerShell.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Command Line:** Check the alerting command line in the EDR logs to determine if the command execution is legitimate or malicious and analyze the URL involved for any indicators of compromise.
    
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Investigate the ParentCommandLine field to identify the process that initiated the command execution. Understanding the context of how the command was executed can provide insights into potential malicious behavior.
  - **Correlate with Network Data:** Use the NDR (Network Detection and Response) tool to correlate the command execution with any network activity related to the detected URL. Inspect whether any connections were made to suspicious external addresses or domains.
  - **Check Historical Context:** Search through Sysmon logs and Windows logs to identify any previous instances of similar command executions or any known threat indicators linked to the detected command line patterns for prior activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the alert's combination of a URL and AppData usage in a command line execution, the severity is set to medium. This prioritization indicates a potential risk that should be investigated promptly due to its association with common malware behaviors.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the command line syntax is altered to evade detection, such as encoding URLs or using alternate command interpreters outside of `cmd.exe`. Additionally, benign applications that legitimately use URLs and reference AppData may lead to false positives. Analysts should assume that sophisticated attackers might employ obfuscation techniques, necessitating further investigation beyond just this rule's triggers.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially unauthorized access to sensitive files on a Windows system through the use of Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). The rule targets command-line executions that involve path references to Volume Shadow Copy, specifically looking for commands attempting to copy files like the NTDS (Active Directory) database, and critical registry hives such as SYSTEM and SECURITY. By monitoring process creation logs, particularly the command-line arguments, this rule helps to detect activities that could indicate an attacker is attempting to extract sensitive information or credentials from the system. The rule aligns with MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1490, which focuses on "Inactivity Removal," demonstrating the risk posed by unauthorized data access using VSS.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR and Process Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs in the endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to identify the source of the command execution and associated user activity that triggered the alert.
  - **Review Windows Security Logs:** Examine Windows Security logs for any corresponding authentication events that may indicate how the command was executed, focusing on the user account involved.
  - **Analyze Command Context:** Utilize Sysmon logs to correlate the command used with other surrounding activities—such as network connections or file accesses—that may provide context around the incident.
  - **Examine Volume Shadow Copy State:** Investigate the state of the Volume Shadow Copies on the system using PowerShell or command-line tools to confirm the existence and integrity of any shadow copies that may have been accessed.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the sensitive nature of the files involved—such as the NTDS database and registry hives—this alert is prioritized as high severity. Unauthorized access to these files can lead to significant data breaches and compromise of domain credentials.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where Volume Shadow Copies have been disabled, or if the attacker uses methods to obscure their command-line execution (e.g., by invoking a legitimate application that subsequently performs the file access). Additionally, legitimate administrative activities might occasionally generate false positives, though this is considered unlikely. Engineers should consider variations in user permissions and file system configurations that could affect the execution context when validating potential incidents.

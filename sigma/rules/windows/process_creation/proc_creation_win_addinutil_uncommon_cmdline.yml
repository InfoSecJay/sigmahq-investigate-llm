title: Uncommon AddinUtil.EXE CommandLine Execution
id: 4f2cd9b6-4a17-440f-bb2a-687abb65993a
status: test
description: |
  Detects execution of the Add-In deployment cache updating utility (AddInutil.exe) with uncommon Addinroot or Pipelineroot paths. An adversary may execute AddinUtil.exe with uncommon Addinroot/Pipelineroot paths that point to the adversaries Addins.Store payload.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Uncommon AddinUtil.EXE CommandLine Execution" is designed to identify potentially malicious usage of the Add-In deployment cache updating utility, AddInUtil.exe, in a Windows environment. Specifically, this rule detects instances where AddInUtil.exe is executed with unconventional paths for the parameters `-AddInRoot` or `-PipelineRoot`. Adversaries may leverage this utility to load their custom payloads by manipulating these parameters. The detection relies on process creation logs, particularly focusing on the command-line arguments associated with the execution of AddInUtil.exe. By monitoring these command-line parameters, the rule identifies deviations from expected paths, aiding in the early detection of exploitation attempts. This rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and is categorized under technique T1218, which encompasses the use of system tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to analyze process creation logs for instances of AddInUtil.exe execution that match the captured criteria, especially the command-line parameters used.
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters:** Examine the command-line arguments for suspicious paths that are inconsistent with legitimate usage. Pay close attention to any patterns or anomalies.
  - **Monitor for Related Activity:** Investigate related network connections and file modifications to determine if there are additional indicators of compromise linked to the execution of AddInUtil.exe.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Data:** Leverage SIEM to correlate the alert with other security events, such as process access and file integrity logs, for a more comprehensive view of potential adversary behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified with medium severity due to the potential for adversaries to exploit legitimate tools in their attacks. While not all usages of AddInUtil.exe are malicious, the atypical command-line parameters warrant further investigation to prevent potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are a few recognized challenges in detecting malicious usage of AddInUtil.exe. First, legitimate administrative operations may also use atypical command-line parameters, leading to false positives. Additionally, if an attacker evades detection by renaming or obfuscating their payload, the rule may fail to trigger. Lastly, the rule is contingent on the logging settings of the environment; if process creation logs are not capturing all necessary details, the rule could miss pertinent executions altogether.

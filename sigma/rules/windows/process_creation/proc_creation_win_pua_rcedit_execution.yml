  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "PUA 
  - Potential PE Metadata Tamper Using Rcedit" is designed to detect instances where the tool Rcedit, a utility used for editing Windows executable metadata, is employed to alter important properties of executable files. Such alterations can be indicative of attempts by adversaries to disguise malicious activities or evade detection by renaming system utilities. The rule specifically monitors for process creation events that involve Rcedit executables and filters on critical command-line parameters that suggest changes to metadata, such as modifying the `OriginalFileName`, `CompanyName`, or `ProductVersion`. This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of defense evasion (Tactic ID: TA0005) and specifically targets technique T1036.003 (Credential Obfuscation: Masquerading). Detection relies on telemetry from Windows process creation logs (e.g., Sysmon), focusing on processes spawned with Rcedit where the command line includes specific flags related to metadata changes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Origin:** Verify the source of the Rcedit process using EDR tools to confirm if it originated from a legitimate path or potentially a suspicious location.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line arguments in the process creation logs for any unauthorized or unexpected metadata properties being set, which can indicate malicious intent.
  - **Review Related Activity:** Investigate other related events around the same time to identify any additional potentially malicious activities, such as suspicious file creations or network connections that may correlate with the Rcedit usage.
  - **Engage with Administrators:** If legitimate use is suspected, liaise with system administrators to determine whether the use of Rcedit was authorized or necessary for maintenance of applications or systems.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity because while it may indicate potentially malicious behavior related to evasion techniques, it could also represent legitimate administrative actions for updating executable metadata. Proper context and investigation are necessary to assess the risk accurately.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not trigger in scenarios where Rcedit is used without the identifiable command-line parameters. Additionally, if the executable is repackaged or renamed before execution, or if the monitoring tools are not properly deployed on endpoints, detection may be evaded. The assumption here is that all typical operations utilizing Rcedit are conducted with a known user base; unexpected use by non-administrative personnel may not be captured without additional monitoring configurations.

title: Permission Misconfiguration Reconnaissance Via Findstr.EXE
id: 47e4bab7-c626-47dc-967b-255608c9a920
status: test
description: |
  Detects usage of findstr with the "EVERYONE" or "BUILTIN" keywords.
  This was seen being used in combination with "icacls" and other utilities to spot misconfigured files or folders permissions.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potential reconnaissance activities related to permission misconfigurations on Windows systems. Specifically, it monitors the usage of `findstr.exe` and `find.exe` with keywords that indicate the presence of overly permissive access controls, such as "EVERYONE" and "BUILTIN". Attackers may leverage these commands in conjunction with utilities like `icacls` to extract and review file and folder permissions, aiming to discover misconfigured files that could lead to exploitation. The rule analyzes Windows Process Creation logs for command-line parameters that match the presence of defined keywords, which could signal an attempt to exploit misconfigurations. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of Credential Access (T1552.006), emphasizing reconnaissance techniques utilized by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for suspicious activity corresponding to the alert, focusing on recent command executions related to `findstr` and `icacls`.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Utilize Windows Security and Sysmon logs to validate process creation events and gather contextual information about the users and processes initiating the `findstr` commands.
  - **Assess File Permissions:** Investigate the permissions of the files and directories targeted during the command execution to determine if any actual vulnerabilities exist.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Look into the user accounts that executed the commands for any prior suspicious behavior or excessive privileges that could suggest potential malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level, as the use of `findstr` in this context may indicate active reconnaissance for permission exploits, which could lead to further compromise if vulnerabilities are found.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not activate in environments where `findstr` is benignly used or where sufficient monitoring resources are not in place, leading to potential missed detection of genuine attacks. Additionally, if an attacker uses alternative methods or obfuscates their command execution (e.g., renaming tools or altering command patterns), the detection capability may be compromised. It's essential to consider false positives arising from legitimate administrative tasks where `findstr` is used for valid purposes.

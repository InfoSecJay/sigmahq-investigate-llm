  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule detects potentially malicious behavior involving the Windows command `tscon.exe`, which is used to connect to and redirect Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions. The rule specifically looks for instances where `tscon.exe` is executed with command line arguments that include ` /dest:rdp-tcp#`, indicating an attempt to redirect the session to an RDP destination. This type of activity can signal an unauthorized lateral movement attempt within an enterprise, often employed by attackers to hijack active RDP sessions to gain access to other systems or escalate their privileges. The rule utilizes process creation logs as its primary data source to identify instances of this command being executed, thereby enabling detection of lateral movement techniques categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework (specifically, Tactic: Lateral Movement; Techniques: T1021.001 – Remote Services/Remote Desktop Protocol, and T1563.002 – Remote Services: RDP Hijacking).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution for instances of `tscon.exe` running with the suspect command line argument `/dest:rdp-tcp#`. Look for any unusual parent processes that may indicate suspicious activity.
  - **Contextual User Analysis:** Investigate the users who executed the `tscon.exe` command to determine whether this activity aligns with normal business operations. This may involve reviewing the user’s role and their recent activities.
  - **Examine Network Connections:** Utilize your network detection tools to analyze outbound RDP connections from the affected machine. Confirm if there are unexpected remote endpoints that correlate with the time of the alert.
  - **Audit RDP Session Details:** Check the Windows Event Logs related to RDP sessions (Security log) to obtain insights into user logons, session creation, and any failed login attempts during the time window of the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is marked as high due to the potential implications of RDP session hijacking, which can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and lateral movement through the network. Immediate investigation is recommended to mitigate possible threats to sensitive systems.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger in scenarios where legitimate administrative users execute `tscon.exe` without malicious intent, as well as environments with explicitly configured RDP usage policies that include similar command line parameters for authorized use. Further, the accuracy of detection heavily relies on event logging settings that may vary across different systems, potentially affecting the visibility of this behavior.

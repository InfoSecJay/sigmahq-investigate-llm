  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where "whoami.exe" is executed by users associated with privileged accounts, such as 'AUTHORI', 'AUTORI', or 'TrustedInstaller'. The rule leverages process creation logs to monitor executions that could indicate privilege escalation attempts, a tactic highlighted in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the techniques T1033 (Credential Dumping) and T1060 (Indicator Removal on Host). Typically, "whoami.exe" is used to confirm the identity and group memberships of the current user, making its execution in a privileged context suspicious and warranting further investigation.
  The primary technical data source for this rule is the process creation log, which captures details about each process started on a Windows system, including the executable name and user initiating the process. By examining logs for "whoami.exe" in conjunction with the specified privileged user accounts, the rule effectively flags potential malicious behavior indicative of adversarial tactics aimed at privilege escalation or reconnaissance within a networked environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in EDR to confirm the execution of "whoami.exe" and gather contextual information such as the timestamp, initiating user, and any parent processes involved.
  - **User Account Verification:** Verify the legitimacy and role of the user account that executed "whoami.exe" to determine if it indeed holds privileged access and assess potential misuse.
  - **Cross-reference Additional Logs:** Look for concurrent events in related telemetry sources (e.g., Sysmon logs, Security Event Logs) to identify other unusual activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or abnormal process behavior.
  - **Assess System Impact:** Investigate whether this execution aligns with any known legitimate maintenance activities or if it is abnormal behavior that requires further action or escalation.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of privilege escalation and unauthorized access within the enterprise environment, which can lead to significant security breaches if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if "whoami.exe" is executed outside of the specified privileged user accounts or under unusual conditions not accounted for in the current detection logic. Additionally, if adversaries utilize renamed copies of "whoami.exe" or execute it in non-standard ways, the rule may fail to detect such activities. There is an inherent assumption that accounts listed in the rule are always considered privileged in the specific environment; changes in user role definitions or the introduction of new privileged accounts could also impact detection efficacy.

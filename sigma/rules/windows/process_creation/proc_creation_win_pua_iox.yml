  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "PUA 
  - IOX Tunneling Tool Execution" is designed to identify the execution of IOX, a tool used for port forwarding and acting as an intranet proxy. This rule operates by monitoring process creation events on Windows systems, specifically looking for the executable `iox.exe` and its associated command-line parameters that indicate tunneling or proxy functionalities (e.g., commands containing 'fwd' or 'proxy'). Additionally, it uses specific hashes for different versions of the IOX executable to ensure detection accuracy. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactic of Command and Control and the technique T1090, which pertains to the use of proxies for command-and-control traffic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Alert in EDR:** Analyze the process creation event in your EDR solution to confirm that `iox.exe` was executed on a host. Check the command-line arguments used during execution to identify the specific function invoked (forwarding or proxying).
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Examine the network flows and logs from the firewall or network detection tools to see if there are any connections established that align with the tunneling activities triggered by IOX.
  - **Review User Context:** Investigate the user account that executed the IOX tool. Determine if the account is a known admin, a service account, or associated with suspicious activity in the environment, as inappropriate use could indicate a deeper issue.
  - **Assess Potential Impact:** Check for any lateral movement or other unusual activities on the network that may have coincided with the IOX execution. Anomalies in network traffic patterns may help reveal other malicious activities related to this alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for malicious activities, such as tunneling sensitive data exfiltration or facilitating unauthorized network access, both of which can greatly increase the security risk to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the IOX tool is executed with different filenames or command parameters that are not captured by this detection logic. Additionally, legitimate use cases for tunneling tools in specific environments could lead to false positives. Responders need to be aware that sophisticated adversaries may modify the tool or its behavior to evade detection, including using obfuscated command-line parameters or renaming the executable.

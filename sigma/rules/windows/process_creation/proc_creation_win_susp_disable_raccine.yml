  ### Technical Context
  The Raccine Uninstall detection rule aims to identify the uninstallation of Raccine, a ransomware protection tool that helps secure Windows systems from ransomware threats. The rule works by monitoring specific command-line activity that indicates the removal of the Raccine software. It looks for three distinct command patterns: the use of `taskkill` to terminate the Raccine process, the use of `reg.exe` to delete registry entries pertaining to 'Raccine Tray', and the execution of `schtasks` to delete scheduled tasks associated with Raccine. This detection is primarily accomplished by analyzing process creation logs from Windows systems, ensuring that any malicious attempts to uninstall Raccine are detected swiftly. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for defense evasion (T1562.001), highlighting attempts an adversary might make to disable security tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review recent process creation logs in your EDR for entries matching the detected command-line patterns. Pay special attention to the source of the commands and the user context in which they were executed.
  - **Examine Security Event Logs:** Investigate the Windows Security Event Logs to assess any attempts to modify system configurations or security settings that correlate with the command execution times.
  - **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Access the scheduled tasks list on the affected system to verify if any Raccine related tasks were deleted as indicated by the command detection. Cross-reference against normal administrative practices.
  - **Conduct a Registry Audit:** Perform an audit on the registry entries associated with Raccine and check if modifications or deletions occurred as part of the investigative process. Look for anomalies in the registry that could indicate unauthorized changes.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because the uninstallation of a ransomware protection tool like Raccine can significantly increase the vulnerability of an endpoint, potentially exposing it to ransomware attacks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses less common methods for uninstalling Raccine, such as direct manipulations via PowerShell scripts or third-party uninstallation tools that do not trigger standard process creation logs. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions related to system maintenance or software management could also result in false positives, as the rule may not differentiate between malicious activity and normal administrative tasks.

title: Remote Access Tool - LogMeIn Execution
id: d85873ef-a0f8-4c48-a53a-6b621f11729d
status: test
description: |
  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting LogMeIn execution focuses on identifying the creation of a process associated with the LogMeIn remote access tool, specifically through the `LMIGuardianSvc` service. This service is an integral part of LogMeIn's functionality and, when executed under abnormal circumstances, may indicate malicious intent, such as an adversary leveraging legitimate tools to gain unauthorized access to a system. The rule looks for specific attributes in process creation logs, particularly those indicating the invocation of `LMIGuardianSvc` by filtering on the `Description`, `Product`, and `Company` fields within the telemetry data. Utilizing Windows Sysmon logs, this detection mechanism leverages the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Command and Control tactics (T1219), which identifies the use of remote access tools for maintaining persistent control over compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Context of Use:** Review the associated user account and determine if the execution of LogMeIn aligns with known business processes or support needs, using EDR tools to check the user's history. 
  - **Assess Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the Sysmon logs to examine the command-line parameters, parent processes, and associated timestamps to understand the circumstances of the LogMeIn execution.
  - **Check for Related Network Activity:** Use network logs (EDR and NDR) to identify any outbound connections that coincide with the detected LogMeIn activity, evaluating if the traffic appears suspicious.
  - **Review User Access and Permissions:** Analyze user account privileges in Azure AD or on the local domain to ensure that the account running LogMeIn has the appropriate-level access and verify any anomalies.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity as while the use of LogMeIn can be legitimate, it poses a risk for unauthorized access and exfiltration. Prompt investigation is crucial to determining if the execution indicates a true malicious event or an acceptable operational usage.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger in environments where the LogMeIn service is disabled or uninstalled, or if application control settings inaccurately classify it as a harmless application. Additionally, legitimate users may unknowingly execute LogMeIn as part of their routine operations, contributing to potential false positives. Adversaries can also disguise their activities using renamed processes or exploit other remote tools that are not being monitored under this specific rule.

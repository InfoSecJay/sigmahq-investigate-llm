  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify instances where the `netsh.exe` command is used to modify firewall settings and allow connections to the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389. Specifically, it looks for command-line parameters that indicate the creation of firewall rules that permit inbound TCP connections on this port. The rule identifies these activities by monitoring process creation events specifically for the `netsh.exe` executable, along with its associated command-line arguments. This activity is particularly notable because it can be leveraged by malicious actors, as evidenced by its use in malware such as Sarwent, making it a recognized tactic under the MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1562.004 
  - Impair Defenses: Disable Security Tools).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the EDR for alerts regarding `netsh.exe` usage, particularly focusing on the timestamps and corresponding user accounts involved in the execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Examine the command-line arguments associated with occurrences of `netsh.exe`, ensuring that they specifically match patterns indicative of changes to RDP firewall settings.
  - **Cross-Reference Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs—specifically the Security log—for related logon events from users who executed `netsh.exe`, to determine if there were any suspicious login patterns preceding this command execution.
  - **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to monitor for unusual inbound traffic to port 3389, especially from unexpected IP addresses or during non-business hours.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that enabling RDP can expose systems to unauthorized remote access, alerts triggered by this rule are classified as high severity in an enterprise environment. Immediate investigation is warranted to assess the legitimacy of the activity and prevent potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where `netsh.exe` is used with variations or alternative syntax not captured in the command-line conditions. Additionally, if administrative actions are conducted through other means such as Group Policy or via legitimate administrative tools, the alert may not trigger. Responders should note that a knowledgeable adversary may obfuscate command lines or use alternative methods to manipulate firewall settings, thus evading detection.

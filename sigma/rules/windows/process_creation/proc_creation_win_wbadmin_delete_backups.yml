  Detects the deletion of backups or system state backups via "wbadmin.exe".
  This technique is used by numerous ransomware families and actors.
  This may only be successful on server platforms that have Windows Backup enabled.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the malicious deletion of Windows backups using the `wbadmin.exe` command-line tool, which is a common method employed by ransomware to eliminate recovery points and hinder restoration efforts. The rule focuses on monitoring process creation events where `wbadmin.exe` is invoked with parameters indicating a deletion action for backupsâ€”specifically searching for command-line arguments containing 'delete' and 'backup.' This detection leverages data from Windows Security logs and Sysmon process creation logs, ensuring that it captures relevant attributes such as the command line executed and the original file name for accurate alerting. This activity is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1490, which deals with the impact of data destruction and is crucial for identifying potential ransomware behaviors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Sysmon process creation logs for instances of `wbadmin.exe` being executed with the command-line arguments indicating backup deletion activities. Validate the timestamp and the user account that executed the command.
  - **Correlate with Security Logs:** Utilize the Windows Security logs to track access and permissions associated with the user account that executed the deletion. Look for unusual access patterns or privilege escalations leading up to the event.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Check endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for any alerts or behavior flagged in association with the execution of `wbadmin.exe`. This may provide context regarding the file system activity occurred post-deletion.
  - **Assess Backup Status:** Verify the status of backups on the affected system through backup management tools or logs, checking for recent backup completions or failures prior to the deletion event. This can help in understanding the impact and urgency of the response.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level because the deletion of backups can significantly hinder recovery operations and is often associated with malicious activities like ransomware attacks. Prompt investigation is needed to ascertain the intent and context of this action.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if `wbadmin.exe` is executed with alternative parameters that don't include 'delete' or 'backup' or if legitimate administrative scripts inadvertently trigger similar deletions without the specific commands monitored in this rule. Furthermore, if Windows Backup is not enabled on the server, no activity will be flagged. It is also assumed that the necessary Sysmon and Windows Security logging are properly configured and operational to capture relevant events.

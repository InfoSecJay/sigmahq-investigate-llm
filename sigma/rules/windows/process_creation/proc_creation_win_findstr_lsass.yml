  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential reconnaissance activity targeting the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process, which is a crucial component in managing user authentication on Windows systems. The key focus of this rule is to detect the execution of `findstr.exe` or `find.exe` commands that include "lsass" in their command line. These commands are indicative of attempts to search within process data or event logs for the LSASS process ID (PID), which may be used by adversaries to gather sensitive information, including user credentials. The detection leverages telemetry from process creation logs to monitor for specific command line arguments associated with the use of `findstr`, as specified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the **Credential Access** tactic (T1552.006).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Process Creation logs for instances of `findstr.exe` or `find.exe` with command lines containing "lsass" to confirm potential unauthorized reconnaissance efforts.
  - **Correlate with EDR Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to trace related processes or earlier activities to see if they indicate a pattern of suspicious behavior or coordinated attack efforts.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Investigate the context of the user executing the command and assess their permissions, roles, and potential motivation for running such reconnaissance commands.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Check for unusual network activity or connections initiated by the user or process around the time of the command execution to identify any further malicious intent or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential exploitation of LSASS, which may lead to credential theft and broader compromises in the environment. Quick investigation is crucial to mitigate the risk of significant security breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if adversaries use alternative tools or methods for querying process information that do not utilize `findstr.exe` or `find.exe`. Additionally, legitimate administrative users may occasionally run similar commands for troubleshooting, which could lead to false positives. The detectionâ€™s efficacy depends on the completeness of process creation logs, and it assumes that the command is not obfuscated.

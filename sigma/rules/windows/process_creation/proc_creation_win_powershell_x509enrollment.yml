  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activity relating to the use of the `X509Enrollment` class, specifically when processes containing the command line arguments `X509Enrollment.CBinaryConverter` or the specific GUID `884e2002-217d-11da-b2a4-000e7bbb2b09` are initiated. The detection leverages process creation logs, which capture details about newly spawned processes and their command-line parameters, to identify unauthorized or malicious use of this component often exploited by adversaries for defense evasion. This method aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically the "Defense Evasion" tactic under technique T1553.004, as it identifies attempts to evade detection by obfuscating actions through legitimate Windows components.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR to examine the process creation logs triggered by this rule, focusing on the command line and parent-child process relationships for anomalies or known malicious patterns.
  - **Check for Legitimate Context**: Assess the context in which the alert was raised to identify whether it originates from approved administrative scripts or tasks, as legitimate administrative activities may generate false positives.
  - **Analyze Related Network Activity**: Inspect the outbound network logs from the detected process to check for unusual or unauthorized connections that could indicate an ongoing compromise or data exfiltration attempt.
  - **Correlate with Other Security Tools**: Use SIEM or other security tools to correlate this activity with other logs (like Sysmon, AV, and other telemetry) for a broader understanding and validation of the incident.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for misuse of legitimate Windows functions in evading detection, necessitating a closer investigation to determine authenticity and potential threat level.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in all scenarios, such as when the command-line arguments are altered or obfuscated, or if other legitimate processes use similar syntax without malicious intent. Additionally, the rule assumes that all relevant process creation events are logged; environments with overly restrictive logging settings may fail to capture the necessary events for detection. It is important for engineers to recognize that attackers can defeat this detection by employing custom command-line arguments or using other programming models that bypass reliance on the `X509Enrollment` class.

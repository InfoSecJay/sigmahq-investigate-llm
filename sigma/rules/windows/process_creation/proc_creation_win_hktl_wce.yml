  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - Windows Credential Editor (WCE) Execution" is designed to detect instances where the Windows Credential Editor (WCE) is executed on a system. WCE is a tool often used by attackers to manipulate or extract Windows credentials. The rule focuses on identifying specific characteristics of process creation logs within Windows environments, particularly looking for unique hashes associated with WCE executables and command-line parameters that signal its execution. 
  This rule collects data from Windows Security Event Logs, utilizing process creation events to identify when any executable related to WCE is launched by the `services.exe` process with a command line ending in `-S`, while filtering out cases where `clussvc.exe` (the Cluster Service) is involved. By inspecting the hash values and command-line arguments through Sysmon logs, this detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Credential Access tactic (T1003.001), specifically targeting tools and techniques for credential dumping.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the process tree and execution details associated with the detected alert in your EDR tool to understand the context and identify any suspicious parent processes.
  - **Hash Verification:** Use the provided IMPHASH values to query threat intelligence databases or local repositories to verify if the detected hashes correspond to known malicious or suspicious versions of WCE.
  - **Command-Line Analysis:** Inspect command-line arguments used during the execution. Investigate any legitimate services or applications that may employ similar command-line patterns to rule out false positives.
  - **Network Activity Review:** Correlate any network connection logs from EDR/NDR to check for unusual outbound traffic or connections initiated by the process in question, which could indicate further malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated by this rule are categorized as "critical" due to the inherent risk associated with credential manipulation tools. Such tools can facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive information, making immediate investigation and response crucial to preventing potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are certain limitations and assumptions with this rule. It may not trigger if WCE is executed with altered hashes or without standard command-line arguments that this rule looks for. Additionally, if an attacker utilizes obfuscation techniques or renames the tool, it may evade detection. The rule also assumes that Sysmon is appropriately configured to log the relevant events; hence, insufficient logging can lead to gaps in detection.

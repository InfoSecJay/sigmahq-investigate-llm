title: Persistence Via Sticky Key Backdoor
id: 1070db9a-3e5d-412e-8e7b-7183b616e1b3
status: test
description: |
  By replacing the sticky keys executable with the local admins CMD executable, an attacker is able to access a privileged windows console session without authenticating to the system.
  When the sticky keys are "activated" the privilleged shell is launched.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Persistence Via Sticky Key Backdoor" detection rule identifies potential attempts by an attacker to gain unauthorized privileged access to a Windows system by replacing the Sticky Keys executable (`sethc.exe`) with the command prompt executable (`cmd.exe`). When Sticky Keys are triggered (usually by pressing the Shift key five times), the substitute command prompt is launched, allowing attackers access to a privileged shell without the need for standard authentication. This tactic falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactics of "Persistence" (T1546.008) and "Privilege Escalation."
  The detection mechanism focuses on monitoring process creation logs, analyzing command-line parameters for specific strings indicative of the replacement action (i.e., 'copy ', '/y ', and the paths of `cmd.exe` and `sethc.exe`). If any process creation events match the defined criteria, the rule will trigger an alert, prompting further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Suspicious Activity:** Use your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to check for recent activities and processes initiated around the time the alert was triggered, focusing on execution chains and parent-child relationships.
    
  - **Analyze Event Logs:** Review the Windows Event Logs (Security, System) for any unusual logon events or privilege escalation attempts that coincide with the detected process creation to gather context about user activities.
    
  - **Inspect File Integrity:** Look for changes to the `sethc.exe` file by verifying its hash against a known good baseline. Also, verify the integrity of the `cmd.exe` and the permissions of these critical executables.
  - **Cross-reference with Network Data:** Use network connection logs and proxy records to determine if there were any outbound connections or suspicious network behavior immediately following the alert, which could indicate exfiltration or further malicious actions.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule is classified as critical due to the severe nature of unauthorized privilege escalation through a covert mechanism, enabling attackers to bypass standard security controls and gain administrative access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule assumes that the monitored endpoints are using default paths for system executables, meaning any custom configurations or unconventional file locations could cause the rule to fail. Additionally, if an attacker deletes or reverts the file modifications quickly enough, the change may not be captured by the monitoring system. There is also an assumption that the user role performing the action will have appropriate permissions; if there are deviations in expected user behavior, such as service accounts being exploited, this could evade detection.

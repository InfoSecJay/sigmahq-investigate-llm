title: Persistence Via Sticky Key Backdoor
id: 1070db9a-3e5d-412e-8e7b-7183b616e1b3
status: test
description: |
  By replacing the sticky keys executable with the local admins CMD executable, an attacker is able to access a privileged windows console session without authenticating to the system.
  When the sticky keys are "activated" the privilleged shell is launched.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies attempts by an attacker to create a backdoor using the Sticky Keys feature in Windows. The malicious technique involves replacing the legitimate Sticky Keys executable (`sethc.exe`) with the command prompt executable (`cmd.exe`). As a result, when users activate Sticky Keys by pressing the Shift key five times, it opens a privileged command shell without requiring authentication. The rule inspects process creation logs for specific command-line instructions that indicate an attempt to overwrite `sethc.exe` with `cmd.exe`, specifically looking for the command to copy the executable files. This detection uses Windows process creation logs to track suspicious file manipulation activities that could lead to privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution to find instances of the command line indicating the copying of `cmd.exe` to `sethc.exe`. 
  - Validate if any user accounts with administrative privileges initiated the suspicious command by checking user activity logs against the event.
  - Analyze any associated file system changes around the `C:\windows\system32` directory using file integrity monitoring tools to confirm unauthorized modifications.
  - Investigate network logs to identify any outbound connections from systems with the suspicious backdoor activity, checking for unusual connections to known malicious IPs or domains.

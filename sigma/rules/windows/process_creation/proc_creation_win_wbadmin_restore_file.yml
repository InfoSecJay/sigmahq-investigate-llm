  Detects the recovery of files from backups via "wbadmin.exe".
  Attackers can restore sensitive files such as NTDS.DIT or Registry Hives from backups in order to potentially extract credentials.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the use of the Windows backup utility, **wbadmin.exe**, to recover files from backups. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where **wbadmin.exe** is executed and is accompanied by command-line parameters indicating a recovery action targeting files. By identifying the usage of recovery commands—particularly those that include phrases such as ‘recovery’, ‘recoveryTarget’, and ‘itemtype:File’—the detection rule aims to highlight potential unauthorized access to sensitive files, which attackers may exploit to obtain credentials or other confidential information. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1490: Inhibit System Recovery**, which involves manipulating backup systems to facilitate unauthorized data recovery.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the Windows Event Logs (Sysmon and/or Security logs) for entries related to the execution of **wbadmin.exe** around the time of the alert. Look for execution paths and any associated parent processes to determine the context of the command invocation.  
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Inspect the command-line arguments utilized during the **wbadmin.exe** execution to confirm whether file recovery was initiated and to identify the specific files targeted. Pay particular attention to parameters like ‘recovery’ and ‘itemtype:File’ in the command line.  
  - **Review Backup Logs:** Access backup software logs or Windows Event Logs related to backup and restore operations to evaluate the success of the recovery process and identify the source of the backup being restored. Verification of legitimate backup schedules can help rule out malicious activity.  
  - **Investigate Network Access:** Assess network logs (e.g., from EDR or NDR tools) for any unusual access patterns or connections that coincide with the time of the **wbadmin.exe** execution, especially connections to sensitive resources or systems that may not align with normal operations.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is considered **medium** as unauthorized recovery of files, particularly sensitive data, can indicate a breach or compromised internal systems. Investigations must be conducted promptly due to the potential risks associated with data exposure.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if wbadmin.exe is executed without the specific command-line arguments indicative of a recovery action or if it is executed in a context that does not generate process creation logs (e.g., in highly restricted environments). Additionally, attackers may bypass detection by renaming the executable or using alternative recovery tools. Recognizing legitimate administrative use of **wbadmin.exe** is crucial, as false positives may lead to unnecessary investigations.

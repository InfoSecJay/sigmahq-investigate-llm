  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious MsiExec Embedding Parent" aims to detect potentially malicious behavior where adversaries misuse `msiexec.exe` to facilitate the execution of harmful payloads. This is assessed by monitoring process creation logs for specific indicators: the rule checks for instances where processes, specifically `powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`, or `cmd.exe`, are spawned with `MsiExec.exe` as the parent process and possess the `-Embedding` argument in the command line. This behavior is identified as part of the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218.007, which relates to the defense evasion tactics employed by attackers to mask their activities by leveraging legitimate system processes.
  This detection relies on data sources such as Windows event logs focusing on process creation, allowing for the identification of unusual parent-child relationships in process executions. By analyzing the command line parameters of these processes, analysts can discern efforts to misuse the `msiexec.exe` utility in a bid to execute malicious commands without drawing immediate attention.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Utilize EDR tools to review alerts related to `msiexec.exe` and the respective child processes. Pay attention to the timeline and user activity around the observed processes.
    
  - **Analyze Process Command Lines:** Examine the command line arguments associated with the suspicious processes. Look for unexpected or unusual parameters, especially those involving paths to known benign executables.
  - **Review Security Logs:** Inspect Windows Security logs for any abnormal login activity that coincides with the time of the alert. Correlate this information with the corresponding process creation logs if there are instances of privilege escalation.
  - **Network Activity Assessment:** Utilize network monitoring tools to check for outbound connections initiated by the suspicious processes. Anomalous connections, especially to unknown or unusual IP addresses, may indicate further compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert warrants medium severity due to the potential risk posed by subprocesses initiated by legitimate tools like `msiexec.exe`. If confirmed, this behavior could indicate a sophisticated attempt to evade traditional detection mechanisms by exploiting a standard Windows process.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger in environments where `msiexec.exe` is regularly used for legitimate software installation, potentially leading to false negatives in heavily utilized systems. Furthermore, if the command line parameters are obfuscated or manipulated beyond simple combinations, the rule may fail to fire. Adversaries with knowledge of this detection mechanism may employ alternative methods to execute commands or disguise their activities that do not align with the expected patterns, thereby evading detection.

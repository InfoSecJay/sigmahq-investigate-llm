  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect anomalous child processes spawned from `dns.exe`, a legitimate Windows component responsible for domain name resolution. The rule specifically looks for instances where a process, particularly `conhost.exe`, is initiated as a child of `dns.exe` without the expected process chain. Such unexpected behavior may suggest a potential exploitation attempt, such as those demonstrated in the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-1350 (SigRed), which is known for enabling Remote Code Execution (RCE) through specially crafted DNS requests. By monitoring process creation events, primarily via Windows Sysmon logs, the rule utilizes the event details surrounding process initiation, including the parent-child relationship of processes, to identify suspicious activity. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of initial access, specifically technique T1133, which relates to external remote services.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Anomaly:** Check the execution context of the detected `conhost.exe` instance in your EDR tool to confirm it truly is a child of `dns.exe`. Investigate its command line and attributes for any signs of abnormality.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Use network monitoring tools to analyze recent connections made by `dns.exe` leading up to the creation of the suspicious child process. Identify any unusual or unauthorized external destinations.
  - **Review Event Logs:** Query Windows Event Logs (especially Security and Sysmon) to correlate other system events around the same timestamp to detect any broader indicators of compromise or related activities.
  - **Conduct Malware Scans:** Run a full malware scan on the affected endpoint with your AV solution to rule out any malicious software or remnant processes that may have exploited the observed behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity level due to the serious implications of potential remote code execution, which could lead to unauthorized access or control over systems within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not capture all exploitation attempts, as attackers could utilize obfuscation techniques to hide their malicious processes or could use alternative processes other than `conhost.exe`. It also assumes that `dns.exe` is operating in its regular context; therefore, any legitimate application that interacts in unexpected ways with `dns.exe` might yield false positives. Additionally, the absence of Sysmon logs in certain environments could result in missed detections.

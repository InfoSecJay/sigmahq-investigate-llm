  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "New ActiveScriptEventConsumer Created Via Wmic.EXE" is designed to detect instances where the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility is used to create an ActiveScriptEventConsumer. This is significant as adversaries can employ such tactics to establish persistence on compromised systems. Specifically, the rule focuses on detecting the creation of event consumers using specific command-line arguments: 'ActiveScriptEventConsumer' and ' CREATE '. The primary data sources involved include process creation logs, which provide visibility into the command-line executions and their parent processes. Additionally, this rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically targeting the tactic of persistence (T1546.003), wherein attackers seek to maintain their foothold within a compromised environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Details:** Use EDR to review the process execution details for WMIC and any associated processes, examining parent-child relationships and execution contexts to understand the origin of the alert.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the CommandLine field for the execution of WMIC that matches the specified criteria, paying particular attention to any unusual or unauthorized patterns alongside legitimate usage.
  - **Analyze Affected Systems:** Identify the systems where the alert was fired and conduct a broader assessment for any other indicators of compromise, focusing on persistence mechanisms commonly exploited by attackers in your environment.
  - **Assess User Behavior:** Review user activity logs in the Windows Security logs to determine if the WMIC command was executed by a legitimate user or if the activity appears anomalous, warranting further investigation or response.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level of this alert indicates that the detection of WMIC usage for creating an ActiveScriptEventConsumer is a serious concern, as it suggests potential malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence. Immediate investigation is warranted to prevent further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate applications are used to create ActiveScriptEventConsumers as part of their normal functioning. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes alternative mechanisms or obfuscation techniques that do not trigger the defined command-line patterns, then these activities may evade detection. It's also possible that well-known trusted scripts or administrative uses may generate similar command-line arguments, leading to false positives that may require tuning of the rule to reduce noise.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Nltest.EXE Execution" is designed to detect executions of the `nltest.exe` utility, which is frequently used in Windows environments for domain-related queries and information discovery. This utility can provide sensitive information about a domain and its configuration, making it a target for attackers seeking reconnaissance capabilities within a network. The rule specifically looks for process creation logs that indicate the execution of `nltest.exe`, as well as the original file name `nltestrk.exe` that may accompany it. 
  The detection leverages Windows event logsâ€”specifically the process creation logs provided by Sysmon or Windows Security. By examining the command-line parameters and the originating process information associated with `nltest.exe`, the rule helps identify potentially malicious usage while also considering legitimate administrative activities to reduce false positives. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Discovery (TA0007), particularly the techniques T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery), T1018 (Remote System Discovery), and T1482 (Domain Trust Discovery).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use an EDR tool to examine the logs related to `nltest.exe` execution, focusing on correlating timestamps and user accounts involved.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Check the command-line parameters associated with the `nltest.exe` invocation; unusual flags or arguments may indicate misuse.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity:** Look into the associated user account activity around the time of the alert to determine if it was initiated by a legitimate admin or an unauthorized user.
  - **Inspect Network Communication:** Investigate any network calls made by the `nltest.exe` process, as it may connect to domain controllers or other sensitive resources that warrant further scrutiny.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that `nltest.exe` can expose critical information about domain configurations, the alert is categorized as low severity primarily due to its potential for both legitimate administrative use and misuse by attackers in reconnaissance phases.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `nltest.exe` is executed in a manner that does not generate process creation logs (e.g., if executed from a non-standard context or using obfuscation techniques). Furthermore, an assumption is made that administrative users will invoke `nltest.exe` appropriately, potentially leading to legitimate alerts that must be investigated. Attackers may also employ techniques to disguise their activities, including using other tools or methods to discover domain information, which may not fall under this rule's detection scope.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential data exfiltration activities taking place through the use of the WINZIP utility on Windows systems. When adversaries aim to exfiltrate sensitive information, they often compress or encrypt this data to conceal its nature, implementing third-party tools like WINZIP to facilitate this process. The rule focuses on specific patterns in the command-line parameters associated with the execution of WINZIP. By identifying commands that include 'winzip.exe' or 'winzip64.exe', as well as check for the presence of flags indicating password protection (e.g., '-s"') and the actions of archiving or minimizing operations (represented by '-min' and '-a'), the rule can flag unusual or unauthorized use of this software. 
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic "Collection" and technique "T1560.001" (Archive Collected Data), as it highlights the normalization of data exfiltration techniques that adversaries might adopt.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line arguments associated with recent WINZIP executions to determine if they exhibit any suspicious patterns or flags indicative of data exfiltration.
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze the Windows Process Creation logs in Sysmon or equivalent to identify the parent process of WINZIP, which may help trace the method of compromise or initiation.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Utilize EDR or NDR tools to inspect outbound network connections that coincide with the compression events captured; signals may indicate if data is being sent to an external destination.
  - **Consult Security Event Logs:** Cross-reference Windows Security Event Logs to identify any anomalous account activity, particularly around the times the WINZIP operations occurred, which may indicate misuse of legitimate accounts.
  ### Prioritization
  An alert generated from this rule should be treated with medium severity in an enterprise environment, as it indicates a significant potential for data exfiltration, although not all instances of WINZIP usage are malicious. Immediate investigation is warranted to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate use.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if adversaries employ different methods or tools for data compression and exfiltration, such as other archiving tools or custom scripts that do not use WINZIP. It relies on the specific naming and command-line structures of WINZIP, so advanced threats may defeat it by obfuscating these commands or using a less suspicious utility. Additional environmental settings or application whitelisting may also lead to false negatives if legitimate uses are overlooked.

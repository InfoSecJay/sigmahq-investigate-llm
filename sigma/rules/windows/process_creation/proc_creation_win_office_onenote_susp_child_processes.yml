  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious child process creation under the Microsoft OneNote application, specifically targeting processes spawned directly by `onenote.exe`. The rule monitors for child processes that exhibit potential malicious behavior, such as executing embedded objects from `.one` files, which can be used by threat actors to deliver malware. It utilizes Windows process creation logs to analyze the relationships between parent and child processes, looking specifically for notable executable names that often appear in attacks, including `PowerShell.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, and several other legitimate tools that can be misused. By observing these patterns, the rule correlates the presence of probable malicious activity with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for initial access, particularly under T1566 (Phishing) and its sub-technique T1566.001 (Malicious File).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Use an EDR tool to analyze the process tree and identify the context of the `onenote.exe` execution, focusing on the command line and the parent process behavior.
  - **Review Child Process Details:** Inspect the logs for the detected child processes, paying close attention to their legitimacy and any suspicious command-line arguments that may indicate malicious activity.
  - **Check for File Anomalies:** Look in the directories specified by the rule (e.g., `AppData`, `Temp`) to find any associated files or scripts that may have been created by the child processes, especially those matching the identified indicators.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Analyze network connections established by the suspicious child processes using a network detection and response (NDR) tool, which may reveal outbound connections to command-and-control servers.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for significant impact if a successful malicious payload is executed via OneNote. The ability of attackers to exploit trusted applications for initial access increases the urgency for investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule assumes that the proper logging level for process creation is enabled and that Sysmon is correctly configured to capture and relay these events. It may not trigger if a malicious actor utilizes a trusted executable not included in the predefined list, or if they manipulate the command-line arguments of the legitimate tools to blend in with normal operations. Additionally, scenarios where OneNote operates with restricted permissions or is heavily sandboxed may also hinder detection.

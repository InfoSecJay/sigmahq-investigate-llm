  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the execution of GMER, a tool commonly used for rootkit detection and removal. The rule operates by monitoring process creation events in the Windows environment, specifically looking for instances where the executable **gmer.exe** is run. The rule enhances its precision by checking both the image name and known hash values associated with the GMER executable. By leveraging the Sysmon logging framework, which captures detailed information about process creations, as well as the hashes embedded in the logs, this detection aims to identify potentially malicious activities associated with rootkit management. The corresponding MITRE ATT&CK technique for this rule falls under the **Defense Evasion** tactic, specifically indicating the usage of tools intended to manipulate or evade detection by security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Executable:** Use EDR or Sysmon logs to confirm the filepath of the executed process. Ensure that it matches the expected path for **gmer.exe** and hasn't been altered or relocated.
    
  - **Check Process Tree:** Analyze the parent-child process relationships to ascertain how the GMER executable was launched. This will help in identifying whether it was part of a larger malicious activity chain.
    
  - **Review Network Activity:** Investigate any associated network connections or external communications made by the **gmer.exe** process. Use NDR logs to correlate outgoing connections that may signal abnormal behavior.
    
  - **Examine System Artifacts:** Look through System and Application logs for any related entries indicating abnormal system changes or installations that coincide with the execution of **gmer.exe**. This can help establish if it was a legitimate action or part of a malicious attempt.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is classified as high due to the nature of GMER's functionality as a rootkit detector and remover, which if executed by unauthorized personnel could indicate a serious breach involving evasion of security measures. Prompt investigation is needed to ensure that no malicious activities are being concealed under the guise of this tool.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where the tool is renamed or its hashes are altered to avoid detection. Additionally, if the logging configuration for process creations is misconfigured or Sysmon is not deployed, essential telemetry could be missing. Adversaries could defeat this rule by using a modified version of the GMER tool that does not match the monitored hash values or by executing the application in a manner that obscures its true nature (e.g., through script execution).

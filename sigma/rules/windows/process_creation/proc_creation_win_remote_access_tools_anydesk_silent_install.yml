  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances of AnyDesk Remote Desktop silent installations, a method that attackers can leverage to gain unauthorized remote access to systems. By analyzing process creation logs, the rule specifically looks for command-line parameters that indicate a silent install (`--install`, `--start-with-win`, `--silent`). The detection utilizes Windows Sysmon telemetry to capture the process creation events, ensuring comprehensive visibility into the execution context. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically technique T1219, which covers the use of remote access tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use Sysmon logs to investigate the processes that have been created around the time of the alert and verify if AnyDesk was installed.
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Check the `ParentCommandLine` for the process that triggered the alert to determine if its origin is legitimate or suspicious.
  - **Check for Other Indicators of Compromise:** Utilize EDR tools to scan for anomalous behaviors or known indicators (IOCs) related to AnyDesk installation or usage on the affected endpoints.
  - **Consult Network Activity:** Investigate external communications or connections initiated by the AnyDesk process through network logs or the NDR tools to determine if unauthorized remote access has taken place.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is high due to the inherent risks associated with unauthorized remote access tools like AnyDesk, which can facilitate significant security breaches if exploited by an adversary.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where attackers utilize customized command-line options or alternative deployment methods outside the standard parameters used in silent installations. Additionally, legitimate use of AnyDesk within the organization's operational activities could lead to false positives, requiring manual validation of alert contexts. It is also assumed that Sysmon is correctly configured and collecting the necessary telemetry for detection, as misconfigurations or gaps in logging can prevent the alert from triggering.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule identifies suspicious instances of Chromium-based browsers being launched with a specific command-line parameter that indicates the loading of a custom extension. The key identifier for this behavior is the presence of the `--load-extension=` flag in the process's command-line arguments. This rule monitors for processes initiated by known parent processes, such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and similar scripting engines, which adversaries might exploit to execute malicious payloads under the guise of a legitimate browser. Detection primarily relies on the Windows process creation logs to capture these events, allowing analysts to investigate potentially harmful browser behavior. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1176, which pertains to the use of browser extensions for persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Attributes:** Verify the attributes of the browser process using EDR tools to analyze hash values, parent-child process relations, and execution pathways for anomalies.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters of the detected suspicious process for unexpected values, particularly focusing on the `--load-extension=` flag to understand which extensions were loaded.
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Utilize network connection logs to identify any unusual or external communications initiated by the browser, which might indicate malicious or phishing behaviors linked to the custom extension.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check user account activity logs in your SIEM solution to assess if the browser launch aligns with legitimate user actions or if it appears out of context, suggesting potential malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to high due to the potential of malicious extensions to facilitate data theft, credential harvesting, or persistent access, which can compromise sensitive information in an enterprise environment. 
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious Chromium instance does not leverage recognized parent processes or if the command-line parameters are altered to evade detection. Additionally, if an adversary uses obfuscation techniques or other legitimate command-line flags to launch the browser, this rule may fail to capture those actions. It is also assumed that the environment is actively monitoring the specified process creation logs.

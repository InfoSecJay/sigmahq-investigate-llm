title: Execution of Suspicious File Type Extension
id: c09dad97-1c78-4f71-b127-7edb2b8e491a
status: test
description: |
  Detects whether the image specified in a process creation event doesn't refer to an ".exe" (or other known executable extension) file. This can be caused by process ghosting or other unorthodox methods to start a process.
  This rule might require some initial baselining to align with some third party tooling in the user environment.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially suspicious process execution attempts where the images in process creation events do not correspond to recognized executable file types, such as `.exe` or other common extensions. The rule monitors for instances where a process might be initiated using unconventional or non-executable file types, which can indicate techniques like process ghostingâ€”where malicious processes masquerade under benign names or are executed without proper extensions. 
  The technical data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, which detail the execution events including the image file paths, command-line parameters, and the parent-child relationships of processes. By analyzing these attributes, the rule assesses whether the file type is within a set of known executables and filters out various known benign exceptions, allowing for a more targeted detection of potentially malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Utilize your EDR solution to investigate the specific process creation events that triggered the alert, reviewing the command-line arguments and parent processes associated with the suspicious image.
  - Cross-reference the process image with the logs from your AV and NGFW to determine if the file has been flagged or if it has a history of previous detections.
  - Examine network activity related to the affected host through NDR and Proxy logs to identify any outbound connections that may indicate data exfiltration or communication with known malicious IPs.
  - Conduct a review of historical behavior on the affected endpoint, looking for similar process creation patterns or anomalies in user activities that may correlate with the alert.

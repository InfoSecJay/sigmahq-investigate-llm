title: Execution of Suspicious File Type Extension
id: c09dad97-1c78-4f71-b127-7edb2b8e491a
status: test
description: |
  Detects whether the image specified in a process creation event doesn't refer to an ".exe" (or other known executable extension) file. This can be caused by process ghosting or other unorthodox methods to start a process.
  This rule might require some initial baselining to align with some third party tooling in the user environment.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of processes with atypical file extensions that are not commonly associated with executable files (e.g., ".exe"). By analyzing process creation events, the rule identifies instances where a process is invoked from a file with an extension that is not traditionally executable, such as ".bin", ".cgi", or ".tmp". Such behavior may indicate potential evasion tactics employed by adversaries, such as process ghosting, where malicious actions are hidden from standard monitoring. The data sources involved primarily include process creation logs, which capture the details of newly spawned processes, including the file path and name that initiated them. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique of Defense Evasion, particularly focusing on the evasion of detection via misleading process creation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs**: Utilize Windows Security logs to review process creation details surrounding the detected alert, focusing on the command line and parent processes to determine the process's origin and any potentially malicious patterns.
  - **Examine Anomalous Files**: Check the file locations of the detected processes against known legitimate software in your environment and assess whether they correspond to any expected application behavior.
  - **Cross-Reference Known Threats**: Use EDR tools to examine any historical data associated with the suspicious processes, looking for ties to known indicators of compromise (IoCs) or malicious behavior.
  - **Assess User Context**: Investigate the user account associated with the process creation; ensure it falls within prescribed usage patterns, and check for any anomalies or unauthorized access indicators.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium priority due to the potential for evasion tactics being employed to execute malicious processes in a disguised manner. Any deviation from expected executable file patterns warrants attention as it could indicate an attempted compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not be triggered if an adversary uses legitimately named executables or if they manage to alter file extensions in a manner that remains undetected by standard logging mechanisms. Additionally, environments utilizing extensive third-party software may generate false positives, as legitimate applications could utilize unusual file extensions for their operations. The effectiveness of this rule assumes that process creation logs are intact and that no malicious modifications or deletions have occurred prior to the detection.

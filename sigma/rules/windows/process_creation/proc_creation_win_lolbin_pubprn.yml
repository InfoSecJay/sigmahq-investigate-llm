  ### Technical Context
  The "Pubprn.vbs Proxy Execution" Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the Microsoft signed script 'Pubprn.vbs' used by attackers to bypass security controls and execute commands in a stealthy manner. This script is typically utilized in defense evasion techniques, allowing malicious actors to perform actions that appear legitimate due to the script's Microsoft signing. The rule examines process creation logs, particularly focusing on the command-line parameters that indicate the presence of 'pubprn.vbs' and 'script:'. By monitoring these specific patterns, the detection helps to uncover possible misuse of the script, which aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics under defense evasion (T1216.001) for script-based execution. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Check the process creation logs in your EDR for instances involving 'pubprn.vbs' to understand the context in which the script was executed. Pay particular attention to the parent process and any command-line arguments associated with it.
    
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use NDR logs to analyze any network traffic that coincides with the execution time of the script. Look for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts that may indicate malicious activity.
  - **Analyze User Context:** Investigate the user account that executed the script by querying the Windows Security logs for account activity around the same time. Determine whether the user had the necessary permissions to run the script legitimately.
  - **Review AV/EDR Alerts:** Check your AV and EDR for any associated alerts that may have been triggered at the time of execution. This can provide additional insights into whether the script execution resulted in any malicious activities or files.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for 'Pubprn.vbs' to be leveraged in evasion tactics, signifying that while not every execution indicates malicious intent, it warrants prompt investigation to rule out abuse in the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the script is executed with altered command-line parameters or in a manner that does not match the detection criteria. Additionally, if an adversary uses obfuscation techniques or tools that conceal the legitimate execution of the script, the detection could be bypassed. It is also assumed that the script is utilized within a controlled environment where its execution is closely monitored; otherwise, legitimate uses might generate false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The rule "Certificate Exported Via Certutil.EXE" is designed to detect the execution of the Windows utility `certutil.exe` with the command-line flag `-exportPFX`. This command allows users to export certificates, making it potentially useful for legitimate administrative tasks; however, adversaries may exploit it to exfiltrate sensitive certificate-related data, such as private keys, without raising immediate suspicion. The rule analyzes process creation logs for instances where `certutil.exe` is called with the specified export flag, emphasizing the importance of monitoring command-line parameters to identify misuse.
  The detection leverages Windows Security logs, specifically focusing on process creation events. By monitoring for processes that match the image name `certutil.exe` and commands that contain `-exportPFX`, the rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1027), revealing potential attempts to conceal malicious activities under the guise of legitimate operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts**: Review EDR logs to trace the full process chain leading to the execution of `certutil.exe`. Verify whether the execution is part of a script or triggered by user activity.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Examine both the command-line parameters and the parent process for any indications of malicious intent. Look for any unusual flags or parameters that do not align with normal business operations.
  - **Audit User Accounts**: Check the user account context under which `certutil.exe` was executed. Determine if the account should have the necessary permissions to run this command and assess if there are any indicators of compromise.
  - **Cross-Reference Certificate Use**: Search downstream logs for any recent unauthorized access or unusual network activity related to the exported certificates. This can include looking at VPN, firewall, and proxy logs for anomalies.
  ### Prioritization
  When this alert is triggered, it should be considered of medium severity due to the potential risk of sensitive certificate exportation. In an enterprise environment, unauthorized access to certificates could lead to serious security breaches, including impersonation or unauthorized access to secured systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where `certutil.exe` is executed with alternate flags or when the export action is conducted through a different tool. Additionally, if an adversary employs a different method of defense evasion or executes the command from a different, less monitored context, the detection may fail. It assumes that the execution context aligns with typical Windows process monitoring, and if invoked within a legitimate administrative framework, the rule may be bypassed.

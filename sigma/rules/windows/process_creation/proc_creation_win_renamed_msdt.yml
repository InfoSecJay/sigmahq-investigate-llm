  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed Msdt.EXE Execution" Sigma rule focuses on detecting instances where the legitimate Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (Msdt.exe) has been executed under an altered file name. This tactic falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the Defense Evasion technique T1036.003, which addresses the evasion of detection through renaming or masking known binaries. The detection mechanism looks for Windows process creation logs, specifically targeting instances where the `OriginalFileName` field matches 'msdt.exe', but the process is initiated with a different image name (i.e., not ending with '\msdt.exe'). This behavior is often used by adversaries to bypass security measures by disguising malicious activities as legitimate system processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts related to the process creation logs to find further details on the renamed Msdt.exe instance, including timestamps, user accounts involved, and associated processes.
  - **Analyze Process Metadata:** Investigate the properties of the identified process, such as the file path, command-line arguments, and parent processes, to determine whether any anomalous behavior suggests malicious intent.
  - **Leverage Windows Event Logs:** Search through the Windows Security logs for any related events around the time of execution, particularly focusing on event IDs that indicate user account actions which may be connected to the execution of the renamed process.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Utilize network detection and response (NDR) tools to analyze any outbound connections that coincide with the execution of the renamed Msdt.exe process to identify potential data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communications.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential implications of a legitimate tool being used for malicious purposes, indicating possible unauthorized access or exploitation within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker directly creates a new executable with a different name rather than renaming msdt.exe, thus bypassing detection. Additionally, the effectiveness of this rule relies on complete logs from the process creation events; incomplete or missed logging could limit the ability to detect renamed executions. Adversaries may also utilize alternate execution methods that don't involve process creation logs, such as script execution or task scheduling, leading to possible evasion from this rule.

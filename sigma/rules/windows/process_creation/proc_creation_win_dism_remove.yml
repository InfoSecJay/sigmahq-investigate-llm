  ### Technical Context
  The "Dism Remove Online Package" Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious usage of the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool within a Windows environment. DISM is a command-line tool that is primarily utilized to manage Windows images by enumerating, installing, uninstalling, configuring, and updating features and packages. The rule specifically focuses on instances where DISM is invoked with parameters indicative of attempts to disable Windows features or potentially harmful functionality, particularly through the invocation of `DismHost.exe` or `Dism.exe`. The technical data sources involved include process creation logs that capture command-line parameters and parent command-line details. 
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Defense Evasion" (T1562.001), highlighting the use of DISM as a method for adversaries to disable security features like antivirus software. By monitoring for these specific command-line arguments indicating misuse of the DISM tool, security teams can respond promptly to potential threats that may compromise system integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Execution Context**: Check the process creation logs for the instances of `DismHost.exe` or `Dism.exe` and confirm if the parent process and command-line arguments align with legitimate administrative tasks or raise red flags.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments**: Review the command-line details for any unusual parameters associated with disabling features or removal of critical components, especially focusing on the execution of `/Disable-Feature`.
  - **Correlate with Endpoint Activity**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze the endpoint activity surrounding the time of the DISM execution for any additional signs of malicious intent or abnormal behavior.
  - **Review Security Logs**: Cross-reference with Windows Security logs to determine if any security features, such as antivirus or firewalls, were disabled around the same time, suggesting a coordinated evasion attempt.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert arises from potential misuse of a legitimate administrative tool to disable critical security features, it warrants a medium severity level in an enterprise environment. Timely investigation is crucial to mitigate risks of a successful attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger in cases where an adversary utilizes a different, less noticed approach to disable features or if legitimate administrative scripts are executed with similar command-line parameters. Additionally, the rule assumes that logging is correctly configured for process creation events and that there are no discrepancies in event log settings that might prevent the logs from collecting necessary data.

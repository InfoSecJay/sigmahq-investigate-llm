  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect instances where the PowerShell Cmdlet `Stop-Service` is used to stop a Windows service. It focuses on process creation events related to PowerShell, specifically targeting both `powershell.exe` and `pwsh.exe` executable files. The rule looks for command-line arguments that include `Stop-Service`, indicating that a user or script is requesting to halt a particular Windows service. The detection is aimed at recognizing potential misuse of the PowerShell capabilities as part of a broader attack, aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1489 
  - "Service Stop." This technique can be leveraged by adversaries to disrupt essential services and create further vulnerabilities in the target environment.
  The primary data sources for this rule involve Windows process creation logs, capturing relevant details such as the command-line execution involving PowerShell. It scrutinizes both the process execution and the parameters considered suspicious, essential for identifying unauthorized attempts to stop key services in an enterprise setting.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR for Process Activity**: Use the EDR solution to track the historical execution of `powershell.exe` and `pwsh.exe`, focusing on the times and contexts in which the `Stop-Service` command was executed.
  - **Review System/Event Logs**: Examine Windows Event Logs associated with service management (Security, System) to assess whether the stopped service was legitimate and whether it corresponds with other suspicious activity during the same time frame.
  - **Check Service Dependencies**: Investigate if the stopped service has dependencies that could indicate a wider attack vector, and verify if other associated services were also affected, which could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Engage with Incident Response**: If the `Stop-Service` command appears to have been executed without authorization, escalate the incident to the incident response team for further action and possibly containing the threat.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized with a low severity level because while stopping a service can be indicative of malicious behavior, there are numerous legitimate administrative reasons for using the `Stop-Service` cmdlet. Contextual investigation is essential to determine whether the action aligns with those legitimate use cases.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses alternate methods to stop services, such as through direct API calls or using other scripting languages. Moreover, legitimate administrative activities that involve stopping services can generate false positives if not closely monitored and contextualized based on operational needs. Analysts should be aware that routine maintenance or troubleshooting may lead to numerous benign alerts, necessitating proper filtering and contextual understanding of the environment.

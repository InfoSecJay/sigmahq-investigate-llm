  ### Technical Context
  The "HackTool 
  - SOAPHound Execution" detection rule is designed to identify the usage of SOAPHound, a .NET application that can gather sensitive information from Active Directory (AD) using specific command-line arguments. This tool operates by executing commands that often indicate attempts to collect data related to AD users, groups, and domain configurations. The detection logic looks for specific patterns in the command line that are indicative of SOAPHoundâ€™s operation, such as `--buildcache`, `--bhdump`, and others that relate to the cache and output options. 
  The rule leverages Windows process creation logs to capture this activity, focusing on the execution of processes that correspond to AD enumeration attempts. By analyzing the command-line parameters, the detection rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Discovery tactic (T1087), which encompasses techniques employed by adversaries to gather information about system structures, resources, and internal networks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Windows Security logs specifically for process creation events that indicate the execution of SOAPHound with the detected command-line arguments. This may help confirm if unauthorized attempts are made to query AD information.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Use EDR systems to search for instances of the SOAPHound executable along with the identified command-line arguments. Look for any patterns or context around when and how the tool was executed.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Investigate whether the execution of SOAPHound correlates with any unusual or unauthorized outbound network connections, especially those targeting AD-related endpoints or cloud services.
  - **Inspect User Accounts:** Review the user account that executed SOAPHound to assess if it has the necessary permissions for AD enumeration and whether such usage aligns with established roles and functions.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule is categorized as high severity due to the sensitive nature of Active Directory data and the potential for data exfiltration or unauthorized access to user information. Given the critical role AD plays in an enterprise's security infrastructure, the detection of SOAPHound execution could indicate an imminent threat that requires immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where SOAPHound is not present or where command-line argument obfuscation techniques are employed by advanced adversaries. Moreover, the detection might miss non-standard execution methods, such as running from a different script or indirectly invoking the tool through another application. Analysts should also be cautious of false positives where legitimate users or applications may use similar command-line parameters for benign purposes.

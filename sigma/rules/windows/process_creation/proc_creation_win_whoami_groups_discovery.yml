  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Group Membership Reconnaissance Via Whoami.EXE" is designed to detect the execution of the `whoami.exe` command with specific command-line flags (`/groups` or `-groups`). This command is typically employed by users and potentially malicious actors to enumerate group memberships of the current user, revealing account types, security identifiers (SIDs), and associated attributes. Adversaries may utilize this information to gather insights into user privileges and roles within the environment, ultimately aiding in further exploitation or lateral movement within the network. The technical data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs sourced from Windows Event Logs, which capture details about command executions, including the command line used and the image file name.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic of "Discovery," specifically Technique T1033, which addresses techniques that involve obtaining information about user privileges and group memberships. By monitoring the execution of `whoami.exe` with the specified parameters, the rule aims to enhance the organization's ability to identify potential reconnaissance activities by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Source of Execution:** Check the EDR for details on the execution of `whoami.exe`, including the process tree to identify if it was initiated by a legitimate application or suspicious process.
  - **User Context Analysis:** Review Windows Security Event Logs to determine the user account that executed the command, along with the time of execution and potential prior activities of the user.
  - **Cross-reference Permissions:** Use Active Directory logs to assess the userâ€™s group membership and privileges to assess if the activity correlates with authorized personnel or if it raises any red flags.
  - **Threat Actor Behavior Correlation:** Consult threat intelligence feeds regarding common tools or techniques related to `whoami.exe` usage by threat actors and check for similar patterns in your environment.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as medium severity because the execution of `whoami.exe` with the `/groups` option, while not inherently malicious, can indicate potential reconnaissance activities by an unauthorized user or threat actor, warranting further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `whoami.exe` is legitimately used by users for administrative or troubleshooting purposes without the `/groups` flag. Additionally, advanced adversaries may obfuscate their actions or use alternative tools to gather similar information, evading detection. The rule assumes that execution of `whoami.exe` will follow standard patterns; any custom scripts or methods to gather group information can lead to missed detections.

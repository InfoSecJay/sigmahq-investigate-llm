status: test
description: Detects the execution of wmic with the "qfe" flag in order to obtain
  information about installed hotfix updates on the system. This is often used by
  pentester and attacker enumeration scripts

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activities by monitoring the execution of the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool with command-line arguments specifically used to query installed hotfix updates. The focus is on the "qfe" flag, which is often employed in pentesting and exploitation scenarios to gather information about current system vulnerabilities. When attackers enumerate the hotfixes on a system, they can assess outdated components that may be exploited for privilege escalation. The primary data sources for this detection include process creation logs that capture the execution of WMIC and its associated command-line arguments, enabling the SOC to analyze legitimate operations versus potentially nefarious reconnaissance efforts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR to identify the specific instances where WMIC.exe was executed with the "qfe" flag, noting the user account and time of execution to contextualize the action.
  - Check the command-line parameters in the process logs for any additional suspicious arguments or behavior that might indicate an automated script or malicious intent.
  - Utilize the SIEM to correlate this WMIC execution with any other security alerts or anomalies that occurred around the same time to understand the broader context of the activity.
  - If applicable, investigate the user account associated with the execution by reviewing historical activity logs on the affected system to determine if previous reconnaissance actions or policy violations have been established.

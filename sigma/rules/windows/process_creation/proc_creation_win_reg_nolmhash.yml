  Detects changes to the "NoLMHash" registry value in order to allow Windows to store LM Hashes.
  By setting this registry value to "0" (DWORD), Windows will be allowed to store a LAN manager hash of your password in Active Directory and local SAM databases.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects changes to the "NoLMHash" registry value, specifically when it is set to "0". When this value is modified, it allows Windows to store LAN Manager (LM) hashes of passwords in both Active Directory and local Security Accounts Manager (SAM) databases. Storing LM hashes is considered a significant security risk as these hashes can be easily cracked, leading to potential unauthorized access to accounts. The rule focuses on monitoring process creation events (from Windows Sysmon logs) where the command line used includes references to the relevant registry path and parameters associated with modifying the NoLMHash value. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112 (Modify Registry), which falls under the Defense Evasion tactic. The presence of this rule is vital in proactive security measures to prevent attackers from enabling LM hash storage, which could compromise account credentials.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Sysmon process creation logs for any instances that triggered this alert. Look for processes modifying the "NoLMHash" registry value to determine the source of the change.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate user activity and access patterns around the time of the alert to assess if the action was legitimate or potentially malicious.
  - **Examine Security Events:** Review Windows Security Event Logs for any relevant security events surrounding the time the rule was triggered, especially logs indicating privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Utilize EDR and NDR tools to analyze network communications from the affected endpoints to identify any suspicious outbound connections that could suggest data exfiltration or further malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is deemed high severity due to the potential security implications of enabling LM hash storage. If an adversary successfully configures this setting, it could lead to the compromise of sensitive accounts within the organization.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an unauthorized change to the registry occurs without the standard process creation oversight or if it is made through other means (e.g., direct registry edits via scripts or services that do not log process creation events). There is also an assumption that the monitoring of Sysmon logs is adequately configured and that the relevant telemetry is being collected. Adversaries could bypass detection by using tools or techniques that do not generate conventional log data.

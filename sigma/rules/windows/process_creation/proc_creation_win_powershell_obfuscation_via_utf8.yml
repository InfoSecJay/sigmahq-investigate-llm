  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect suspicious PowerShell command-line syntax often used by threat actors to obfuscate commands as a means of defense evasion. Specifically, it looks for instances where the command line contains the encoded character syntax for the WCHAR data type, which may precede an encoded payload in PowerShell scripts. The primary data source involved in this detection is the process creation logs from Windows systems, allowing for the monitoring of anomalies in command-line parameters invoked by potentially malicious processes. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059.001) and Defense Evasion (T1027), as it seeks to identify obfuscated PowerShell scripts that attempt to execute malicious actions while evading detection mechanisms.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Process Creation Log**: Use EDR tools to correlate the detected command with the processes involved. Check for the parent process and any other spawned child processes for anomalies.
  - **Review PowerShell Logs**: Investigate relevant Windows PowerShell logs for additional context about the execution, such as timestamps, user accounts, and associated script blocks that may detail the obfuscation technique used.
  - **Query Threat Intelligence**: Utilize threat intelligence platforms to look up the command string and related behavior. This can help determine if the detected syntax aligns with known threat actor tactics or campaigns.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Check network connection logs for any suspicious outbound traffic that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communications following the PowerShell execution.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands can indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent or activity intended to bypass security measures, alerts generated by this rule are considered high severity. 
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where PowerShell usage is tightly controlled or heavily monitored, potentially misleading analysts to underestimate risk. Additionally, it assumes that command lines are properly logged and accessible; if logging is misconfigured or disabled, detection will fail. It also assumes that adversaries will employ recognizable obfuscation techniques, which may not always be the case if they adapt to this detection method.

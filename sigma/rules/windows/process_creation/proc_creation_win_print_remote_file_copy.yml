  ### Technical Context
  The "Abusing Print Executable" Sigma rule aims to identify potential misuse of the `print.exe` utility on Windows systems. Attackers may exploit `print.exe` to facilitate the remote copying of files, a tactic that can be leveraged to exfiltrate data or introduce malicious payloads onto target systems. The rule focuses on specific command-line parameters and the execution of the `print.exe` binary. It captures process creation events with relevant command-line arguments that indicate potential abuse, specifically looking for invocations starting with "print" and containing the `/D` option followed by executable file names. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (System Binary Proxy Execution), which describes how system binaries can be manipulated for malicious purposes.
  The detection primarily relies on Windows process creation logs, specifically leveraging Sysmon and Windows Event Logs to capture data such as image paths and command-line parameters associated with process execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to filter for `print.exe` executions, examining the process creation logs alongside their command-line parameters for any suspicious patterns, especially those that include the `/D` option with executable files.
  - **Examine Network Activities**: Check for any suspicious network connections made by the process, utilizing NDR or NGFW logs to identify data exfiltration attempts or connections to known malicious IPs during the timeframe of the alert.
  - **Inspect Related File Activities**: Analyze file system logs for any unauthorized file transfers or creations that correlate with the timing of `print.exe` executions, which could indicate attempts to deploy or exfiltrate malware.
  - **Audit User Account Behavior**: Review the actions of the user or service account that initiated the `print.exe` process to determine if their behavior is consistent with legitimate activities or indicative of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential of `print.exe` being misused for malicious purposes, leading to data leakage or system compromise. While often a benign utility, its exploitation can indicate more severe underlying issues.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if an attacker renames `print.exe` or employs an alternative method to copy files that bypasses the typical Windows process creation paths. Assumptions include that Sysmon monitoring is correctly configured to capture all process creation events. Additionally, the rule may yield false positives if legitimate applications utilize `print.exe` in expected operational contexts without malicious intent.

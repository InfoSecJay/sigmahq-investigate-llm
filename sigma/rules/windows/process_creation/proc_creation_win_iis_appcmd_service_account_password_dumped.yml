  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential credential dumping activities targeting Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) by monitoring the command-line tool, AppCmd. The rule looks for process creation events where AppCmd is invoked with arguments related to listing configuration settings, specifically targeting sensitive information like service account passwords. The investigation is guided by the detection of specific command-line parameters in conjunction with the process name "appcmd.exe". The relevant technical data sources include process creation logs that provide insights into executed commands, helping to highlight any suspicious activity linked to potential credential access. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Credential Access" and its corresponding technique (T1003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the EDR console for alerts related to the execution of AppCmd, focusing on any suspicious command-line arguments such as `list`, `/config`, `/xml`, or parameters indicating password retrieval.
  - **Analyze Process Tree:** Use the EDR to examine the process tree associated with the detected instance of AppCmd to determine if it was spawned by a legitimate service or a potentially malicious process.
  - **Correlate with Windows Security Logs:** Investigate Windows Security logs to review user authentication attempts, particularly around the time of the AppCmd execution to identify any unauthorized access or usage of service accounts.
  - **Examine IIS Logs:** Analyze IIS logs for any unusual web activity or patterns that coincide with the timeframe of the command execution to understand the context of the AppCmd invocation and potential exposure of sensitive data.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high-severity level of this alert, it signals a significant security risk as it indicates potential unauthorized attempts to access sensitive service account credentials, which could lead to further compromise of systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the AppCmd tool is not present or accessible on the monitored systems. Additionally, if attackers utilize alternative methods to access passwords (e.g., directly interacting with the configuration files or using non-standard tools), the detection may fail. The rule is also based on the assumption that appropriate logging is enabled and that commands are executed in ways that generate identifiable logsâ€”if logs are cleared or events are suppressed, the detection will be ineffective.

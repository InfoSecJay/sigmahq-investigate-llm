  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Wab Execution From Non Default Location" is designed to detect the execution of the `wab.exe` and `wabmig.exe` executables, which are components associated with Windows Contacts and the Microsoft Address Book Import Tool, respectively. This rule focuses specifically on identifying instances where these binaries are executed from non-default locations on the system, which is indicative of potential malicious activity. The detection relies primarily on process creation logs to identify when these executables are launched and examines the paths from which they are executed.
  The rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of **Execution** and **Defense Evasion** (T1203 and T1036). By monitoring command-line parameters and executable paths, the rule aims to flag potentially unauthorized access, particularly in the context of the Bumblebee malware, which is known to abuse these executables to facilitate lateral movement and other nefarious activities within an enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine log entries for `wab.exe` and `wabmig.exe` executions, paying attention to the full file path for potential deviations from known good locations.
  - **Assess Command-Line Parameters:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to analyze the command-line parameters associated with the detected processes, as they may reveal the intent behind execution.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity:** Investigate the user account that initiated the process to ensure it corresponds to legitimate actions; look for any recent suspicious activity or anomalies.
  - **Scan for Related Artifacts:** Utilize antivirus (AV) and other security tools to check for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) on the system related to Bumblebee or other malicious frameworks.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is designated as high priority due to the association of these executable files with malware exploitation techniques. Unauthorized execution of these processes from non-standard locations could indicate a significant security breach requiring immediate investigation and remediation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized issue is that the rule may not trigger if the executables are run from a default or whitelisted location, potentially allowing malicious activities to go undetected. Additionally, if an attacker renames the executable files or employs obfuscation techniques, the rule would fail to identify the activity. It's also important to note that benign processes could be executed from non-default locations in specific, legitimate scenarios that might generate false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Unmount Share Via Net.EXE" is designed to detect the removal of mounted shares on Windows systems through the execution of the `net.exe` or `net1.exe` command-line utilities. This detection utilizes process creation logs, specifically analyzing the command-line parameters to identify when the switch `/delete` is used in conjunction with the term "share." The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic is Defense Evasion (T1070.005), which involves clearing or manipulating logs or other indicators of compromise to hide malicious activity. By monitoring the specific conditions set in the rule, security teams can recognize when an adversary may be attempting to obscure their actions by disconnecting network shares that are no longer useful.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Source of Command:** Check the process creation logs within EDR for the originating user account and system where the `net.exe` command was executed. Confirm if this account has legitimate reasons to remove shares.
  - **Review User Activity:** Utilize Windows Security logs to review other actions taken by the user before and after the share removal. Look for any suspicious behavior, such as unexpected file access or command execution.
  - **Analyze Network Share History:** Investigate previously active share connections using the Windows event logs to identify if any critical shares were deleted and where they were accessible from.
  - **Cross-reference with Other Tools:** Check Proxy and VPN logs for any external connection attempts from the user before or after the share unmount operation to understand the broader context of the activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered low severity as it may often represent standard administrative actions taken by users to manage network shares. However, increased frequency or association with other suspicious activities may warrant a higher investigation priority.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that all share removals are logged appropriately and that necessary permissions are in place to execute `net.exe` commands. It may not trigger in cases where logs have been cleared by the attacker or if the command is executed in a context that does not generate a process creation entry. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities by users may lead to false positives, which security teams should be prepared to differentiate from malicious actions.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule focuses on detecting the execution of well-known DNS exfiltration tools, specifically `iodine` and `dnscat2`, which adversaries may utilize to siphon sensitive data out of a network. The primary data sources for this detection are process creation logs, which capture information about the execution of new processes on Windows systems. By monitoring for specific images associated with these tools, the rule aids in identifying potential malicious activity related to exfiltration and command-and-control operations. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactics of Exfiltration (T1048.001) and Command and Control (T1071.004), highlighting the importance of monitoring for tools that facilitate unauthorized data transmission.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Investigate the `process_creation` logs in your EDR for any instances of `iodine.exe` or `dnscat2` being executed, noting the User Account and Parent Process ID for context.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Review network connection logs for unusual DNS traffic patterns or connections established to known malicious or atypical domains associated with the detected tools.
  - **Examine Execution Context:** Look into the command-line parameters used during the execution of these processes in the Sysmon logs for any suspicious flags or arguments that indicate malicious intent.
  - **Review Endpoint Activity:** Utilize the AV logs to determine if any detections occurred on the endpoint during the time `iodine` or `dnscat2` were running, providing insight into any potential remediation efforts needed.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated by this rule should be treated with high severity as the execution of DNS exfiltration tools is indicative of serious information security threats, potentially leading to unauthorized data leakage from the organization.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the exfiltration tools are renamed or not directly referenced by their conventional filenames (`iodine.exe`, `dnscat2`). Additionally, it assumes that the logging level is appropriately configured to capture process creation events and that adversaries are not employing custom or less-known tools for DNS tunneling. Analysts should be aware of the possibility of false negatives if the tools are executed in a manner that obfuscates their true behavior.

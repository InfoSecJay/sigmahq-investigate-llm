  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potentially Suspicious Rundll32 Activity" is designed to detect potentially malicious usage of the `rundll32.exe` process on Windows systems. This process can execute DLL files and is frequently misused by attackers to execute arbitrary code through DLLs associated with legitimate system functionality, such as `shell32.dll` or `dfshim.dll`. The rule specifically looks for command-line invocations of `rundll32.exe` with parameters that suggest the execution of known Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBINs)â€”a common evasion tactic employed by adversaries. By analyzing data sources such as process creation logs (via Sysmon), the detection focuses on specific command-line patterns that are often indicative of abuse, referencing MITRE ATT&CK's technique T1218.011 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR for Process Creation Logs:** Investigate events related to `rundll32.exe` executions in your EDR tool, focusing on the command lines that triggered the alert to identify any unusual or unauthorized DLLs being called.
  - **Examine Parent Processes:** Use your EDR to analyze the parent processes of the detected `rundll32.exe` execution, looking for unusual or unexpected parent relationships that may indicate scripting or administrative tool misuse.
  - **Check Windows Event Logs:** Review relevant Windows Security, System, or Application event logs for any abnormal activities, such as unexpected service startup events or elevation of privileges around the time of the detected execution.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize NDR or firewall logs to evaluate any network activity generated by the suspicious `rundll32.exe` execution, particularly looking for outbound connections to unusual or unauthorized external IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity because suspicious activity involving `rundll32.exe` can indicate an attempted compromise. However, the presence of false positives related to legitimate administrative functions means this requires careful validation prior to escalation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if an attacker uses less recognized or custom command-line arguments with `rundll32.exe`, potentially bypassing detection. Additionally, legitimate administrative tools or scripts explicitly relying on these DLLs could generate false positives, assuming they are not typical for the environment. Variability in environments can also lead to different DLL versions or configurations that may result in missed detection. It is essential for engineers to continuously tune and refine the detection logic based on operational feedback and threat landscape changes.

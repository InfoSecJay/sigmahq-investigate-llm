  ### Technical Context
  The "Dropping Of Password Filter DLL" Sigma rule detects the suspicious creation of Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files in the system32 directory, which can potentially be used to extract user credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). This behavior is indicative of credential theft techniques, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Credential Access, specifically the technique T1556.002 (Credential Dumping: Password Filter DLL). The rule focuses on the command-line arguments used during the process creation event, specifically looking for commands that involve modifications to the LSASS settings or utilize the 'reg add' command aimed at adding registry keys associated with credential filtering.
  To identify these threats, the rule utilizes Windows process creation logs, which provide insights into the commands executed by running processes. Specifically, it monitors the command line for any instances that contain keywords related to LSASS management and credential manipulation. Investigators can leverage this telemetry to discern potentially harmful activities that suggest malicious actors are attempting to install DLLs for credential harvesting.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Windows Event Logs for process creation events that triggered this alert to validate the presence of suspicious DLL activities in system32.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Assess the command-line arguments associated with the flagged processes to identify any modifications to LSASS settings or evidence of unauthorized registry changes.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution to gather additional context on the processes in question, including parent-child relationships and process origins.
  - **Check for Known Password Filters:** Investigate if any known malicious password filter DLLs or similar configurations have been introduced into the environment that align with the characteristics of this alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to its potential implications for credential theft, which can lead to broader system compromises if successfully executed. Immediate investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy of the detected activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate modifications to LSASS or the registry are performed, as these actions might not be easily distinguishable from malicious ones. Additionally, if processes are obfuscated or if command line logging is disabled, detection is rendered ineffective. Engineers should be aware that sophisticated adversaries may use techniques to evade detection, such as using custom encodings or alternative DLL paths.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where the `ProtocolHandler.exe` executable is invoked to download files via various protocols such as FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS. `ProtocolHandler.exe` is a legitimate Windows process that can be misused by attackers to download malicious files without user awareness. The rule focuses on monitoring process creation logs; specifically, it checks if `ProtocolHandler.exe` is executed, and whether it includes command-line parameters that indicate a file is being downloaded from external sources, such as links starting with `ftp://`, `http://`, or `https://`. The downloaded files are typically stored in the userâ€™s local INetCache directory, which can also be a sign of malicious activity if used unexpectedly.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review recent process creation logs to identify instances of `ProtocolHandler.exe` being executed, noting any suspicious command-line parameters.
  - Check for unusual activity in the local INetCache directory, including any newly downloaded files that could correspond to the detected executions.
  - Utilize EDR tools to analyze the behavior of the processes associated with `ProtocolHandler.exe`, looking for any connections to known malicious URLs.
  - Investigate user activity logs to determine if any authorized users interacted with `ProtocolHandler.exe` or accessed the downloaded files, assessing the legitimacy of their actions.

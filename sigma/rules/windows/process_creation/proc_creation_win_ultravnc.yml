  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect the use of UltraVNC, a legitimate remote access software, which can potentially be exploited by adversaries to establish unauthorized command-and-control channels within enterprise networks. The rule monitors process creation logs, specifically looking for instances where "VNCViewer.exe", the executable for UltraVNC's client software, is run. By focusing on specific attributes such as the description, product name, company, and original file name, the rule narrows down to legitimate instances of this software, allowing for effective detection of potentially malicious use. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Command and Control (T1219), which outlines methods adversaries may use to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs for instances of "VNCViewer.exe" to confirm whether the software was executed legitimately or maliciously on endpoints.
  - **Analyze Related Network Traffic:** Inspect network logs through NDR and firewall tools for unusual connections or data exfiltration patterns that coincide with the use of the UltraVNC software.
  - **Verify User Context:** Check the user or account that initiated the remote access session to ensure it aligns with normal user behavior in the organization and is not indicative of unauthorized activity.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Cross-reference alerts from other sources such as AV logs, proxy logs, and VPN logs to identify any additional anomalous behavior or correlating events that could indicate a broader attack.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium priority due to the dual nature of UltraVNC as both a legitimate tool and a potential vector for unauthorized access. Prompt investigation is necessary to determine the intent behind its use, as it could signify a compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several blind spots with this rule, including the possibility that the rule may not fire if the malicious actor renames the executable or if some legitimate business operations perform remote support without using UltraVNC. Additionally, the assumption exists that all users who utilize VNCViewer do so with proper authorization; however, internal policy violations may occur. It is important for engineers to understand that adversaries might use alternative remote access tools that are not captured by this rule or employ techniques to obfuscate their actions.

  Detects the execution of Xwizard tool from a non-default directory.
  When executed from a non-default directory, this utility can be abused in order to side load a custom version of "xwizards.dll".

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Xwizard.EXE Execution From Non-Default Location" is designed to detect the execution of the Xwizard tool from directories that are not considered its legitimate locations. Xwizard, typically installed under system directories like `C:\Windows\System32\`, `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\`, or `C:\Windows\WinSxS\`, serves a variety of legitimate purposes but can be exploited for less benign activities as it allows for side-loading of DLLs, specifically `xwizards.dll`. By focusing on process creation events, this rule monitors the `Image` and `OriginalFileName` fields to check for instances of `xwizard.exe`. If Xwizard is detected running from a non-default directory, it raises an alert, identifying a potential defense evasion attempt (MITRE ATT&CK tactic: Defense Evasion, technique: T1574.002). This rule utilizes Windows process creation logs to identify the execution context and location of the executable.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Location**: Investigate the execution path of `xwizard.exe` in the endpoint logs to confirm it was executed from a non-standard directory. Use EDR tools to filter recent process creation events for `xwizard.exe`.
  - **Examine Loaded DLLs**: Check for any associated DLLs loaded during the execution of `xwizard.exe` to identify if potentially malicious libraries have been side-loaded. Utilize tools like Sysmon to monitor the loaded modules.
  - **Assess for Lateral Movement**: Explore network connections initiated by the process, reviewing any unexpected outbound connections or unusual communication patterns that may indicate lateral movement. Use NDR solutions to analyze network traffic associated with the suspect endpoint.
  - **Review User Context**: Investigate which user account executed `xwizard.exe` and evaluate the legitimacy of the user activity at the time of execution. Check Windows Security logs to ensure no unauthorized access occurred.
  ### Prioritization
  Due to the nature of this detection, where executable files may indicate circumvention of security controls, the alert is classified as high severity. Immediate investigation is warranted to assess potential exploitation or malicious activity in the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection relies on the assumption that `xwizard.exe` will be present and its execution will typically be logged as a process creation event. However, the rule may not fire if the executable is run in a legitimate location or if logging is not enabled on all endpoints. Additionally, adversaries could use techniques to mask the execution path or may rename legitimate tools to evade detection, possibly impacting alert effectiveness.

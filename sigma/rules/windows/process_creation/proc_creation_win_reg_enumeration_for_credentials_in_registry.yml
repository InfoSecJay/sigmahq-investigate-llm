  Adversaries may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.
  The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs.
  Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify unauthorized attempts by adversaries to enumerate credentials stored in the Windows Registry. The Windows Registry is a critical database in Windows operating systems that stores configuration settings, including sensitive data such as user passwords and other credentials. The rule specifically looks for instances where `reg.exe`, a Windows command-line utility used for interacting with the registry, is invoked with specific command-line parameters indicative of enumeration activities targeting stored credentials.
  The detection is anchored around two primary conditions: the invocation of `reg.exe` with commands that suggest a search through the registry for sensitive data (`HKLM`, `HKCU`, and particularly the inclusion of the path related to PuTTY sessions). Such activities fall under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Credential Access" (TA0006), specifically the technique "Credential Dumping: Credentials from Registry" (T1552.002). Security operations center (SOC) analysts should prioritize alerts from this rule, as they could indicate malicious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR for Details:** Use your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution to review the process creation logs around the time the alert was generated, focusing on any suspicious activity linked to `reg.exe`.
    
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Examine the command line parameters used in the invocation of `reg.exe` to determine if the searches corresponded with legitimate administrative tasks or if they reflect an attacker's pattern of behavior.
  - **Check for Known Bad Actors:** Cross-reference the user account associated with the credential enumeration attempt. Check if it aligns with known malicious actors or if there are any indications of compromised accounts.
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Investigate network logs to ascertain whether the system was communicating with known command and control (C2) servers around the same time the alert was triggered, which could indicate broader malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because while credential enumeration can indicate preparatory steps for further attacks, it may also be performed by legitimate users during administrative tasks. Accurate context and further investigation are needed to determine the nature of the access.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are a few recognized blind spots with this rule. First, it relies on the assumption that `reg.exe` will indeed be used for credential access; however, attackers may employ alternative methods or tools to interact with the registry without triggering the alert. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions may inadvertently match the detection criteria, leading to false positives. It is also possible that some credential sources are configured in a manner that does not involve the registry or may use encrypted paths that the detection logic does not account for.

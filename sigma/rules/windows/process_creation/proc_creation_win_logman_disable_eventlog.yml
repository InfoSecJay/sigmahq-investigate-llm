  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for "Suspicious Windows Trace ETW Session Tamper Via Logman.EXE" aims to identify potentially malicious actions utilizing the `logman.exe` utility, which can disable or delete Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) sessions. This utility is typically used for managing performance logs, but attackers may leverage it to eliminate traces of their activities, such as when stopping or deleting trace sessions critical for monitoring. The rule focuses on identifying process creations involving `logman.exe` where the command line includes terms like 'stop' or 'delete', particularly concerning specific trace sessions like "Circular Kernel Context Logger" and "SysmonDnsEtwSession". Key data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs and command-line parameters from Sysmon. It aligns with MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1562.001 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools) and T1070.001 (Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution**: Use EDR tools to check if `logman.exe` was executed from a legitimate location. Look for unusual parent-child relationships indicating potential abnormal behaviors.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Review the command line arguments used during the execution of `logman.exe`. Focus on any occurrences of 'stop ' or 'delete ' to assess the intent behind the modifications.
  - **Check for ETW Session Impact**: Check Windows Event Logs to see which ETW sessions were stopped or deleted. Cross-reference this against normal operational procedures to identify any unauthorized changes.
  - **Assess Endpoint Activity**: Utilize the EDR platform to correlate any suspicious activities or other security alerts in the vicinity of the detected command execution, to gain context on the potential incident.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity due to the critical nature of ETW sessions in monitoring activities on Windows systems; tampering with these logs may indicate an ongoing or preemptive attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks or disable monitoring tools.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in cases where `logman.exe` is legitimately used by administrative staff for system maintenance, leading to possible false positives, or when installers disable logging for seamless operations. Additionally, aggressive adversaries may choose to rename or modify binaries, employing techniques to obscure their command-line usage or bypass detections based on expected behavior. Understanding the typical administrative use of `logman.exe` is essential to effectively differentiate benign activity from malicious intent.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule identifies potential security risks associated with the removal of Windows Defender definition files, a tactic leveraged by adversaries to disable security measures and decrease their chances of detection. The rule works by monitoring process creation logs, targeting the Windows Defender command-line tool, MpCmdRun.exe, specifically when it invokes a command with the parameters `-RemoveDefinitions -All`. These parameter flags signal that the process is removing all definition files, which could indicate a malicious attempt to circumvent security controls. The rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique of Defense Evasion, specifically T1562.001, which focuses on disabling security tools.
  The data sources involved include detailed process creation logs which record the execution of the MpCmdRun.exe image and its associated command-line parameters, allowing for effective detection of this suspicious activity. By identifying patterns in how defenders may remove essential components of security applications like Windows Defender, security teams can better respond to potential intrusions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Confirm the Alert Source:** Validate the alert against the process creation logs in the EDR system to confirm that MpCmdRun.exe was executed with the specified command-line parameters. Check the execution context (user and parent processes) for any anomalies.
  - **Assess the System Status:** Use Windows Security logs to verify the status of Windows Defender and ascertain whether the definition files have indeed been removed. Check for any recent changes in security settings that might indicate tampering.
  - **Investigate Related Activity:** Analyze any recent network connections or file changes that coincide with the event, which may suggest further malicious behavior or lateral movement within the environment. Utilize network logs to cross-reference any unusual outbound traffic during this time.
  - **Review System and Application Logs:** Check the System and Application logs for any other security-related events that occurred before or after the removal of the definition files. Look for any error messages or service interruptions that could provide context to the suspected activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the critical nature of Windows Defender's role in maintaining system security. The removal of definition files can lead to a substantial increase in vulnerability across the enterprise, potentially allowing for malicious software to operate undetected.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the malicious actor uses alternative methods to disable or modify security settings, such as directly manipulating Registry keys or utilizing non-standard executable paths. Additionally, if the command execution is conducted from a benign-looking process or using obfuscation techniques, the detection may fail. Analysts should remain vigilant for possible adversarial tactics designed to evade detection beyond this rule.

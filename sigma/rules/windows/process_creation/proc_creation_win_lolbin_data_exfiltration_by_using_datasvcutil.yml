  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential data exfiltration attempts using the `DataSvcUtil.exe` utility, a part of the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) framework. The rule identifies suspicious command-line executions that include parameters indicative of data output, such as `/in:`, `/out:`, and `/uri:`. By analyzing the process creation logs, specifically focusing on the `DataSvcUtil.exe` binary, the detection engine can ascertain whether this utility is being misused to export data from the enterprise environment. This behavior is relevant for the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of exfiltration (T1567), particularly relating to the use of legitimate tools for unauthorized data access and transfer.
  The data sources involved in this detection rule primarily include Windows Sysmon logs, specifically monitoring for process creation events that reveal the command-line invocation of `DataSvcUtil.exe`. By examining the command-line arguments, the rule correlates unusual usage patterns with potential exfiltration scenarios, allowing SOC analysts to initiate timely investigations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Command Line Arguments:** Review the command-line parameters associated with the detected process instance. Pay particular attention to parameters like `/out:` which indicate potential data export actions.
  - **Analyze Process Tree:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate the parent processes and their actions leading up to the invocation of `DataSvcUtil.exe`. This can reveal whether the process was spawned by benign administrative tasks or under suspicious conditions.
  - **Cross-Reference User Activity:** Investigate the user account executing the command to establish context around its legitimacy. Examine the user's previous activities and permissions, especially if the command was issued by an unfamiliar or unusual account.
  - **Evaluate Data Access Logs:** Review logs related to data access and any potential network connections established during the execution of `DataSvcUtil.exe`. This can help ascertain whether any unauthorized data transfers occurred in conjunction with the process execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level because while the usage of `DataSvcUtil.exe` might be occasional for legitimate administrative tasks, any unapproved or unexpected execution, particularly with data output parameters, signals potential malicious intent and requires further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger in scenarios where the `DataSvcUtil.exe` utility is used legitimately by system administrators following standard operational protocols, resulting in false positives. Additionally, if an adversary alters command-line parameters or executes the binary through unintended paths, the rule may fail to capture such activity. Analysts should be aware that the success of this detection depends heavily on maintaining comprehensive logging practices and that variations in command usage may lead to missed alerts.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - KrbRelayUp Execution" is designed to detect the use of the KrbRelayUp tool, which is employed in Windows domain environments to exploit vulnerabilities related to Kerberos ticket-granting tickets. This tool allows attackers to escalate privileges locally—an action that can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. The rule focuses on identifying process creation events where specific indicators associated with KrbRelayUp are present in the command lines or executable images. The primary data sources include process creation logs that spotlight command-line arguments for the execution of binaries like `KrbRelayUp.exe`. The MITRE ATT&CK framework’s credential access tactic, particularly the technique (T1558.003), and the lateral movement technique (T1550.003) are relevant here, as they relate directly to unauthorized privilege escalation within a network environment lacking proper security configurations, such as LDAP signing enforcement.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Execution Context:** Use EDR tools to review the execution context of the detected process, including user accounts and parent process information to identify any unusual patterns or escalated privileges tied to the execution of `KrbRelayUp.exe`.
    
  - **Review Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command line parameters associated with the detected process in the process creation logs to ascertain if they include critical keywords indicative of KrbRelayUp usage.
    
  - **Check Network Activity:** Examine recent network connections through firewall and network logs to identify any unusual outbound connections that may correlate with known behaviors of Kerberos exploitation attempts following the execution of the tool.
  - **Assess User Behaviors:** Review user login and access patterns in conjunction with the timing of the detected alert using Windows Security logs to identify any anomalous access attempts or lateral movements across the network.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity level due to the potential impact of privilege escalation, which could enable an adversary to gain extensive control over sensitive systems within the environment, thereby increasing the risk of data exfiltration or further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire if the KrbRelayUp tool leverages obfuscation techniques or if the binary name is altered, as the rule specifically checks for the original file name and specific command-line arguments. Additionally, environments with strict monitoring on command-line parameters may also miss such execution attempts if the tool is called indirectly or via scripts that do not expose those parameters. It’s important for engineers to recognize that various evasion tactics can lead to undetected uses of KrbRelayUp or similar tools in compromised systems; thus, a layered approach to security is recommended.

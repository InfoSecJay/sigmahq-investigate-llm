  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled **Kernel Memory Dump Via LiveKD** aims to detect the execution of the LiveKD utility, specifically targeting instances where it is invoked with the `-m` flag. This flag is indicative of an attempt to dump kernel memory, a technique often utilized by adversaries for gathering sensitive information from a compromised system, such as passwords, keys, or other critical data. This action directly relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** and more specifically the technique of **T1070 
  - Indicator Removal on Host**.
  To accomplish this, the rule examines **process creation logs** for the presence of the executable files `livekd.exe` and `livekd64.exe`. It also scrutinizes the **command-line parameters** to confirm the inclusion of the `-m` flag, which is an indication that the user intends to create a memory dump. By monitoring this potentially malicious behavior through the Windows operating system's telemetry, the rule plays a vital role in identifying suspicious activity that could signify a compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Inspect the process creation logs in the EDR system for instances of `livekd.exe` or `livekd64.exe` being executed, especially focusing on the command line for the `-m` flag.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Activity:** Use Windows Event Logs (Security) to retrieve detailed command-line data when LiveKD is invoked, including user accounts and timestamps, to establish whether the execution was legitimate.
    
  - **Check for Additional Indicators:** Look for other related processes or suspicious activities occurring around the same time that may suggest an adversary is attempting further actions, like dumping or exfiltrating data.
    
  - **Review Sysmon Logs:** Identify any associated events logged by Sysmon, such as network connections (e.g., outflow of data) or unusual registry modifications that could correlate with the memory dump activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated from this detection rule is classified as **high severity** due to the critical nature of kernel memory dumping, which can lead to significant data breaches and unauthorized access to system credentials and sensitive information.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the LiveKD tool is executed without the `-m` flag or if it is renamed to evade detection. Additionally, if an adversary uses a different memory dumping technique or utility not monitored by this rule, such as built-in Windows debugging tools, the detection could fail. There is also an assumption that standard monitoring configurations are enforced and that potential legitimate uses of LiveKD in production are minimal.

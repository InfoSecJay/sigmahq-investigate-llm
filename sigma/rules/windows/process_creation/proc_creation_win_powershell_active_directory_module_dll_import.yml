  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential Active Directory (AD) enumeration attacks by monitoring for specific PowerShell command executions that utilize the Active Directory module. The rule focuses on detecting the use of the `Import-Module` cmdlet to load the `Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll`, which attackers frequently employ to gather information about the AD environment, including user accounts, groups, and other critical data without requiring administrative privileges. The primary data sources leveraged for this rule include process creation logs that capture the execution of PowerShell commands and their associated command-line parameters. This detection is aligned with MITRE ATT&CK tactics including Reconnaissance (TA0043) and Discovery (TA0007) as attackers seek to gather valuable information about the target network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR alerts**: Review any alerts from EDR related to the execution of PowerShell commands, especially those triggering this rule, to identify any suspicious patterns or behavior.
    
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Analyze Windows process creation logs to investigate the context in which the `Import-Module` command was executed, including the user account and any parent processes.
  - **Examine Network Logs**: Check relevant network logs for unusual communication patterns originating from the affected system that may correlate with unauthorized AD enumeration activities.
  - **Investigate User Activities**: Assess the user activity and access logs to determine if the user executing the commands has a legitimate need for using the Active Directory module, or if they were acting outside of their normal duties.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to its indication of potential reconnaissance activities that could precede more significant attacks. While legitimate administrative tasks may utilize the Active Directory module, the command's usage alongside suspicious behaviors warrants prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are inherent blind spots in this detection rule, such as legitimate administrative use where authorized personnel might invoke the Active Directory module in valid scenarios. Additionally, if an attacker is already operating on a compromised account with sufficient privileges, they may perform AD enumeration without triggering this rule. The rule may also fail to fire if an adversary uses obfuscated PowerShell commands or alternative scripting languages to perform similar activities, making detection more challenging.

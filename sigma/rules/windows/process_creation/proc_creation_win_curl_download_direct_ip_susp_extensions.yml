  ### Technical Context
  The rule "Suspicious File Download From IP Via Curl.EXE" is designed to detect potentially malicious file downloads initiated through the use of `curl.exe`, a command-line tool commonly utilized for transferring data using various protocols. This rule examines the command-line arguments associated with process creation events to identify patterns indicative of suspicious activity targeting file downloads from IP addresses rather than domain names. Specifically, it looks for instances where the curl command includes parameters such as `-O`, `--remote-name`, or `--output`, and checks the file extensions against a list of potentially harmful file types (e.g., `.exe`, `.dll`, `.bat`, etc.). By leveraging Windows process creation logs, the rule specifically targets execution patterns that could denote an attempt to deploy malicious payloads in an enterprise environment.
  This type of activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (specifically technique T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer), where threat actors may utilize downloads from IP addresses to obtain malicious code, bypassing traditional domain-based monitoring mechanisms. Effective detection relies on thorough monitoring of process creation logs and an understanding of how command-line parameters can signal potentially harmful behavior.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to gather process creation logs focusing on instances of `curl.exe`, inspecting the associated command-line arguments for any suspicious file downloads from IP addresses.
    
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic**: Investigate the network logs (NDR) around the time of the alert to identify outgoing and incoming traffic patterns, confirming whether a malicious payload has been transferred via the corresponding IP.
  - **Analyze File Output**: Search for files created in the file system that match the extensions identified in the detection rule. Assess the integrity and behavior of these files to understand potential impacts.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators**: Utilize threat intelligence sources to correlate any identified IP addresses or file hashes with known malicious entities, referencing indicators from provided links to validate the investigation further.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity level as the detection of suspicious file downloads via `curl.exe` can signify an immediate threat, potentially allowing malware to be introduced into the environment. Quick and thorough investigation is imperative to mitigate any risks associated with this behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `curl.exe` is executed with different command-line parameters or modified executables. Furthermore, if an adversary were to use a different mechanism or legitimate user accounts with the same file download tasks, detection would elude this rule. Additionally, the assumption is that all file downloads from IP addresses need scrutiny; however, benign downloads may inadvertently trigger false positives due to the lack of contextual information. Customizations in environments where `curl.exe` is employed legitimately for various tasks could also lead to overlooked alerts.

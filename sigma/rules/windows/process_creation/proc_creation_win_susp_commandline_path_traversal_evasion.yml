  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential command-line path traversal evasion attempts on Windows systems. The rule checks for processes that use suspicious command-line arguments indicating an attempt to escape from their intended directories (e.g., `\..\Windows\`, `\..\System32\`, `\..\..\`). By monitoring process creation events and analyzing the command lines associated with these events, the rule aims to catch adversaries attempting to obfuscate their command execution paths to bypass security controls. Such techniques fall under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically the technique T1036 (Masquerading). The key telemetry sources leveraged by this rule are Windows Process Creation logs, which provide insight into process execution and their command line arguments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Details:** Review the details of the identified process using your EDR to determine its parent process, execution path, and associated user account to gauge whether it's a legitimate or suspicious execution.
  - **Examine Command Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line arguments used by the process, particularly focusing on instances of path manipulation that include traversal sequences (e.g., `..\`).
  - **Analyze Historical Context:** Cross-reference the execution context of the process in question with historical logs from Windows Security, focusing on any prior unusual process behavior or access patterns that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Consult Threat Intelligence:** Utilize threat intelligence resources to evaluate if the observed commands or techniques are associated with known malware or adversarial tools, enhancing the situational awareness of the potential threat.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is set to medium because path traversal evasion attempts can be indicative of skilled adversaries attempting to evade detection mechanisms, necessitating prompt investigation while balancing potential false positives from legitimate applications.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where legitimate applications frequently utilize path traversal for normal operations, such as certain functionalities of Google Drive and Citrix applications. Additionally, the rule assumes that users do not have falsely constructed command lines that could be benign but appear suspicious, which could lead to ignored alerts. Lastly, if an adversary employs techniques to disguise paths or utilizes different command patterns, the detection may fail.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify the use of the Sysinternals tool SDelete, which is designed to securely delete files and free space on Windows systems. Specifically, it focuses on instances where SDelete is invoked with commands that indicate an intent to overwrite a specific file rather than the free space, which could potentially indicate malicious activity such as file tampering or destruction of evidence. The rule captures relevant information through process creation logs generated by Windows, examining the command line used to execute SDelete. By detecting specific parameters like `-h`, `-c`, and `-z`, the rule ensures that real file deletions, not merely space cleaning, are flagged. This detection corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1485 (Data Destruction) under the Impact tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify SDelete Execution:** Check EDR logs for details about the process creation event that triggered the alert. Look for details such as the user and timestamp to evaluate the context in which this command was executed.
  - **Command Line Analysis:** Review the command line used during the execution of SDelete in the process logs. Ensure that it contains parameters that indicate a file-specific overwrite and not just a space cleaning operation.
  - **User Activity Review:** Investigate the userâ€™s behavior leading to the SDelete execution using logs from the identity management system or SIEM. Ensure the user has legitimate access and reason to perform such actions on the specified files.
  - **File System Impact Assessment:** Examine the affected file and any IT asset management logs to understand the potential impact of the deletion. Check if the deleted files belong to sensitive categories that could indicate data tampering or exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a high severity level, as the use of SDelete for file overwriting can signify an active deletion of critical information, often associated with malicious actions such as data exfiltration or insider threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where SDelete is run without the specified command-line parameters or if executed with different filenames or paths. Additionally, it assumes that the logging level is sufficient to capture these process creation events in Windows; if logging is not enabled or if an attacker uses alternative methods to delete files, the rule may not trigger. Lastly, persistence mechanisms or tools that mimic SDelete but avoid detection could be employed by adversaries to evade this detection.

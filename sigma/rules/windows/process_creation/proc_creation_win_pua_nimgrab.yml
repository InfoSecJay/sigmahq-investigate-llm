  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - Nimgrab Execution" is designed to detect the execution of `nimgrab.exe`, a tool associated with the Nim programming framework typically used for downloading files. This rule specifically monitors process creation events and looks for instances where the image name ends with `nimgrab.exe` while also verifying the integrity of the file based on specific hash values. By leveraging the Windows process creation logs, the rule checks for known hash identifiers—both MD5 and SHA256—associated with Nimgrab, as well as its IMPHASH. This kind of detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Command and Control tactic (T1105), which focuses on the adversary's ability to exfiltrate data and manage remote systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check EDR logs for any occurrences of `nimgrab.exe` execution. Examine the timestamp and the user context to determine if the execution aligns with normal operational behaviors.
  - **Investigate File Hashes:** Cross-reference the detected file hashes with threat intelligence databases. Assess whether the file hashes relate to known malicious activities or if they are part of legitimate software development efforts.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Analyze network traffic logs to see if `nimgrab.exe` made outbound connections to any suspicious or known bad IP addresses. Identifying these connections can reveal potential command and control communications.
  - **User Context Review:** Investigate the user accounts associated with the process's execution. Evaluate if these accounts typically engage in operations that involve using development tools like `nimgrab`, or if their activity appears anomalous.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert for Nimgrab execution is considered high severity as it indicates potential command and control activities, which could suggest an ongoing or past attempt at data exfiltration or unauthorized file downloads.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where `nimgrab.exe` is legitimately utilized for development purposes, leading to potential false positives. There is also an assumption that the execution of dubious tools, such as Nimgrab, will not be obscured by obfuscation techniques or renamed executables. An adversary could defeat this detection by executing processes with legitimately appearing names or by using alternate file transfer methodologies that do not involve the `nimgrab` tool.

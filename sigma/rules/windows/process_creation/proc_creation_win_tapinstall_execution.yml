  ### Technical Context
  The "Tap Installer Execution" detection rule is designed to identify potential data exfiltration activities that utilize tunneling techniques through the execution of TAP (network Tunneling and Adaptation Layer) software. The rule specifically targets process creation events for the executable named `tapinstall.exe`, which is commonly associated with the installation of TAP drivers used by VPN software (e.g., OpenVPN, Avast, and ProtonVPN). It leverages Windows process creation logs to detect instances of this executable running outside of expected directories associated with recognized VPN applications. By doing so, the rule helps identify suspicious installations that may indicate preparation for data exfiltration.
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Exfiltration" tactic and specifically the technique T1048, which addresses the use of applications to exfiltrate data, highlighting the importance of monitoring software execution that could lead to unauthorized data transfer.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze the Alert:** Review the file path of the detected `tapinstall.exe` to determine if it corresponds to a legitimate installation of VPN TAP drivers or if it originates from a suspicious source.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to assess the user account activity around the time of alert generation, looking for unusual patterns such as administrative tasks being performed by non-privileged accounts.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Inspect network logs to identify any outbound or suspicious connections established around the time `tapinstall.exe` was executed, which could suggest data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Utilize Sysmon and process creation logs to trace the parent and sibling processes of `tapinstall.exe`, determining whether it was spawned by a known or benign process.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a medium severity level, as the execution of `tapinstall.exe` may indicate the installation of software that could potentially be misused for data exfiltration, warranting closer inspection, especially in a corporate environment where exfiltration risks are prevalent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if TAP installations occur via legitimate processes or are part of a widely accepted IT management practice, such as updating VPN clients. Furthermore, if an adversary uses methods to execute `tapinstall.exe` covertly (e.g., via script, packed binaries), the rule may fail to detect the installation. Additionally, the rule relies on correct logging configurations; if process creation logs are not enabled or are misconfigured, detection may be ineffective.

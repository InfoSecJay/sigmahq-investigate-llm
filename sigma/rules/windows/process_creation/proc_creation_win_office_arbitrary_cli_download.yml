  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential arbitrary file downloads initiated by Microsoft Office applications, specifically Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. The detection operates by monitoring process creation logs for instances of these applications while analyzing their command-line arguments for any occurrences of HTTP or HTTPS URLs. If a process associated with any of these Office applications is launched with command-line parameters that include these types of URLs, it may indicate an attempt to download files over the internetâ€”an action often associated with security threats like malware dissemination. The rule particularly relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (TA0005) and the technique of Untrusted File Download (T1202), highlighting its relevance in detecting potential evasion measures employed by adversaries to deliver malicious payloads using trusted applications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Activity:** Use EDR tools to identify the process tree linked to the detected Office application instance, tracking parent-child relationships and user context to understand the execution environment.
    
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the complete command-line arguments captured in the alert to verify the URL patterns. Analyze the origins of the URLs and check if their domains are known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  - **Examine Network Activity:** Utilize network logs (e.g., from Next-Gen Firewalls or Proxy) to trace any outbound connections made by the Office applications during the time of the alert. Confirm whether any files were downloaded to the endpoint.
  - **Cross-Reference with Endpoint Logs:** Assess Windows Event Logs (particularly Sysmon, if implemented) to gain insights on file creations or modifications that occurred shortly after the instance of the Office app that triggered the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the significant risk of malicious file downloads that can lead to various forms of compromise, including ransomware attacks, data exfiltration, or system breaches. When triggered, immediate investigation is warranted to mitigate potential threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the offending Office application is executed in a way that avoids detection (e.g., through obfuscated command-line arguments or if the associated URLs do not contain recognizable patterns). Additionally, adversaries might use custom-built scripts or tools to launch Office applications without following standard naming conventions or URL structures. The assumption that all instances of process creation accurately indicate user-initiated activity could lead to oversight of automated or scripted behavior in malicious downloads.

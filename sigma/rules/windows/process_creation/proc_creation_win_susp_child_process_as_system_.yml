  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious behavior in a Windows environment by monitoring for child processes that are created with SYSTEM privileges, particularly in cases where the parent processes are running under the LOCAL SERVICE or NETWORK SERVICE accounts. Such a scenario commonly indicates a privilege escalation attempt, where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in service accounts to gain elevated permissions. The rule utilizes data from process creation logs provided by Sysmon, specifically focusing on the `ParentUser`, `User`, and `IntegrityLevel` fields. The technical data sources involved also include command-line parameters, which help in identifying specific patterns that may signal a misuse of legitimate utilities, such as `rundll32.exe`. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, specifically targeting the "Privilege Escalation" tactic (Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1134.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Events**: Investigate any alerts in the EDR for process creation events that match the criteria described within this rule. Pay attention to the parent and child relationships, especially focusing on the users and integrity levels involved.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments**: Check the command-line parameters for the potentially malicious child processes identified by the rule. Look for suspicious patterns or unusual commands that deviate from standard operational behaviors.
  - **Analyze parent processes**: Validate whether the parent processes running under LOCAL SERVICE or NETWORK SERVICE accounts exhibit normal behavior. Investigate their purpose and whether they have been altered or tampered with recently.
  - **Search for Additional Indicators**: Use the SIEM to explore related logs for any additional suspicious activity involving the identified process, such as network connections, registry modifications, or file changes that could correlate with the detected process anomaly.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this rule targets possible privilege escalation attempts by leveraging SYSTEM-level access, a triggered alert is considered high severity. Unauthorized actions taken under SYSTEM privileges can lead to significant breaches and compromise sensitive enterprise assets.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that Sysmon is configured to capture the required data, particularly the `ParentUser` and `User` fields, which may not be available in environments where Sysmon is either not deployed or misconfigured. It may also miss events in scenarios where attackers utilize methods to disguise the parent-child relationship, such as using anti-forensic techniques or sophisticated lateral movement strategies. Furthermore, false positives may arise from legitimate service activity that conforms to the identified patterns, necessitating a thorough investigation to distinguish between benign and malicious activities.

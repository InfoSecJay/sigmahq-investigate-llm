  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the execution of the `schtasks.exe` command with the intent to delete all scheduled tasks on a Windows device. Specifically, it looks for command-line invocations that include the parameters `/delete`, `/tn *`, and `/f`, which collectively instruct the system to forcibly remove all scheduled tasks, regardless of their creator. This form of mass deletion could indicate a malicious actor attempting to obscure their activities by erasing scheduled operations that might monitor or support incident response efforts, a technique associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Impact" (T1489). Data sources relevant to this rule include Windows process creation logs, which provide insight into command execution on the system, revealing the precise actions taken by potentially harmful processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Execution:** Review Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs to gather additional context on the execution of `schtasks.exe`, including the user account associated with the command and any preceding activities that may indicate orchestrated malicious behavior.
  - **Analyze Security Logs:** Inspect Windows Security and System logs to identify any abnormal logins or changes in user activity that coincide with the execution of the deletion command. This can help establish a timeline and detect any suspicious user escalation.
  - **Review Scheduled Tasks History:** Query the system for historical scheduled tasks prior to the deletion event to ascertain which tasks were removed, and assess the potential impact on operational activities or monitoring capabilities.
  - **Investigate Network Connections:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to check for any abnormal outbound connections correlating with the time of the command execution. This can help identify if a compromised host is attempting lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high risk of impacting system integrity and the potential for obfuscating malicious activities, this alert is prioritized as "high" severity. The deletion of all scheduled tasks signifies a significant threat that can disrupt system operations and hinder incident response capabilities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the deletion command is executed in a non-standard way or if an attacker employs alternative methods to delete scheduled tasks, such as via scripts or other means. Additionally, if the `schtasks.exe` process is executed from a directory that isn't monitored, or if PowerShell is used to perform deletions without invoking `schtasks`, the rule will not capture those activities. Adversaries may also bypass detection through legitimate administrative tasks or by running commands under a trusted user account.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious IIS Module Registration" detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activities associated with the registration of IIS modules, which could be utilized by adversaries to establish persistent backdoors on Windows servers. This rule focuses on specific command-line invocations related to module registration in Internet Information Services (IIS), particularly when they are executed with the parent process `w3wp.exe` (the IIS worker process). The key indicators this rule looks for include command-line parameters such as `appcmd.exe add module`, references to `system.enterpriseservices.internal.publish` in PowerShell commands, and the inclusion of `gacutil` commands which may suggest manipulation of Global Assembly Cache (GAC). The underlying data sources used for detection are primarily Windows process creation logs, which capture processes that start and any command-line arguments used.
  This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for persistence, specifically T1505.004, which involves compromising web application servers through malicious modules or extensions to maintain access to a targeted environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine Windows process creation logs for entries that involve the `w3wp.exe` parent process together with the suspicious command-line arguments identified in the alert.
  - **Analyze IIS Configuration:** Check IIS configuration settings and module registrations to identify any unauthorized or unexpected modules that may have been added recently.
  - **Correlate with PowerShell Logs:** Investigate Windows PowerShell logs to find any instances of the command `system.enterpriseservices.internal.publish` or associated activity, which may indicate further misuse of PowerShell in executing malicious commands.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to assess the user accounts involved in the suspicious activity, checking for any administrative accounts that may have conducted legitimate actions around the same time.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is of high severity due to the potential for adversaries to gain unauthorized access and control over web applications hosted on IIS, which poses significant security risks to the integrity and confidentiality of enterprise data.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is essential to recognize that this rule may not fire if attackers use stealthy techniques to evade detection, such as employing less conspicuous processes or legitimate administrative activities. Additionally, if logging is improperly configured or incomplete, especially for IIS or command-line execution events, the rule may also fail to capture the necessary data. Analysts should assume that sophisticated adversaries may choose not to use the specific command lines that trigger this detection, which could limit the ruleâ€™s effectiveness in certain environments.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects suspicious PowerShell commands that utilize base64 encoding, specifically targeting the "MpPreference" cmdlet. The "MpPreference" cmdlet is associated with modifying settings for Windows Defender Antivirus (AV). The detection relies on Windows process creation logs that capture command-line arguments associated with PowerShell executions. By looking for specific encoded strings in conjunction with the command names 'Add-MpPreference' and 'Set-MpPreference', the rule aims to identify potential manipulations intended to bypass or alter security measures put in place by the antivirus software. This mapping falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** and technique **T1562.001**, which encompasses methods adversaries use to evade detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Review the PowerShell process creation logs in your EDR to identify the timestamps and user accounts involved in the detected command executions.
  - **Evaluate Command Context:** Investigate the surrounding processes and command-line arguments that led to the invocation of the suspicious PowerShell scripts to determine if they align with normal operational patterns.
  - **Review Antivirus Alerts:** Check the Windows Defender logs to see if there were any alerts related to the modification attempts of AV configuration, ensuring that the environment remained protected.
  - **Investigate Network Activity:** Use your NGFW and proxy logs to analyze any network activity corresponding to the times the commands were executed, checking for connections to known malicious or unauthorized IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential impact of malicious attempts to modify or disable antivirus protections, which could lead to exploitation or compromise of the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the base64 commands are altered sufficiently to evade detection or if PowerShell logging is misconfigured or disabled in the environment. Additionally, if the environment includes legitimate usage of similar cmdlet executions, there could be an increase in false positives. It's also assumed that all necessary telemetry for PowerShell executions is being collected effectively; if not, this increases the risk of missing true threats.

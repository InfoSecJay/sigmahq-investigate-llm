  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious attempts to modify Windows Defender Antivirus (AV) settings using PowerShell cmdlets that are encoded in Base64 format. Specifically, it looks for the execution of the `Add-MpPreference` and `Set-MpPreference` cmdlets, which are typically employed to manipulate AV configurations. The rule targets specific Base64-encoded command-line arguments that, when decoded, reveal these AV-related modifications. The main data sources utilized in this rule include process creation logs that capture command-line parameters, allowing the detection of suspicious activities that aim to evade defenses by altering antivirus policies.
  By monitoring the invocation of these cmdlets and their encoded variations, security teams can effectively identify and investigate activities that may indicate an attempt to disable or tamper with critical security features, raising alerts for additional context and response actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution to identify the user and context under which PowerShell commands were executed.
  - Decode the identified Base64 strings to determine the exact commands being run and assess their potential impact on security settings.
  - Check for any recent changes to Windows Defender settings via the Defender logs to verify if unauthorized modifications occurred along with the suspicious command executions.
  - Utilize your SIEM or log correlation tool to cross-reference flagged events with known threat actors or tactics related to defense evasion techniques.

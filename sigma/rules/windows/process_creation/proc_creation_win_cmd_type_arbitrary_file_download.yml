  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential data exfiltration or importation activities using the "type" command in Windows, particularly when leveraging WebDAV. The "type" command is a built-in utility that is typically used to display the contents of a text file, but its usage with redirection operators (such as `>` and the path to a WebDAV server) can indicate malicious intent when used to download or upload files. This detection rule relies on process creation logs to identify command-line arguments where the "type" command is invoked, specifically looking for command strings that include the redirection of output to and from a WebDAV share. 
  The rule pertains to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the command-and-control tactic (T1105), which emphasizes the importance of monitoring for suspicious command execution patterns that might signal a breach or exfiltration attempt. Alerting on cases where the "type" command is used with a WebDAV path is crucial for identifying unauthorized uploads or downloads and helps maintain the organization’s data integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process**: Check EDR logs to correlate the process creation events with the user and system context to ascertain if legitimate behavior or unauthorized access is exhibited.
  - **Review Command History**: Use Windows Event Logs to examine the command history for the user account to identify if the "type" command was used previously and assess its context.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic**: Inspect network logs (from NDR/NGFW or proxy) for connections originating from the endpoint to the WebDAV server to determine if actual data transfer occurred.
  - **Examine File System Activity**: Look into file access logs to establish whether any unusual file modifications or creations were made related to the "type" command output.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity because the use of the "type" command to upload or download files via a WebDAV server could indicate potential data theft or compromise, warranting further investigation to rule out legitimate activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the "type" command is executed without redirection or if it is used in a context that doesn’t involve process creation (e.g., executed in an unauthorized shell). Additionally, if the adversary employs alternate methods or obfuscates command usage, such as using PowerShell or encrypted communication channels, the detection may fail. It is assumed that all necessary logging for process creations is enabled, and any command aliases are properly documented and monitored for accurate detection.

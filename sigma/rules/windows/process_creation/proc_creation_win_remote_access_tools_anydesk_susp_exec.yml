  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying the execution of the remote access tool AnyDesk when it is launched from suspicious directories, such as those in the AppData folder or unconventional installation paths. An adversary may utilize AnyDesk, as it is a legitimate desktop support software, to create an interactive command and control (C2) channel within the target system. The rule inspects the process creation logs to detect the execution of AnyDesk's executable (`AnyDesk.exe` or `AnyDeskMSI.exe`) with the specific criteria that the process must originate from a non-standard directory, which could indicate malicious intent. The technical data sources involved include Windows Sysmon logs pertaining to process creation events. This relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic: Command and Control (T1219), highlighting the usage of remote access tools for potentially malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Examine the process creation logs to determine the full path from which AnyDesk was executed. Check if the path is indeed one of the flagged suspicious directories.
    
  - **Review Association with Other Alerts:** Correlate this alert with other logs from EDR to identify if there were any preceding suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual user behavior.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Utilize network detection tools to analyze any outgoing connections established by AnyDesk to identify unusual behaviors or connections to known malicious domains.
  - **Check User Privileges:** Investigate the user account that executed AnyDesk to determine if they have appropriate permissions and if the usage aligns with the organization's expected patterns for remote support tools.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has a high severity level as it signals potential misuse of legitimate software for malicious activities, which can lead to unauthorized access and compromise of sensitive systems within an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule is dependent on the accurate logging and monitoring of process creation events and may not fire if the adversary employs unusual techniques to obscure the execution path (e.g., renaming executables or using alternate execution methods). Additionally, legitimate use of AnyDesk from standard or unexpected directories can generate false positives, indicating the need for context-sensitive investigation. It's assumed that the organization's application control does not permit AnyDesk, and any deviations from standard operational practices should be scrutinized.

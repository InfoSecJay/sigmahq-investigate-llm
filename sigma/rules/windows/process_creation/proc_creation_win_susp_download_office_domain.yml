  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Download from Office Domain" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious download activities from Microsoft domains, specifically those associated with storing email attachments and OneNote documents. This rule triggers alerts when certain known file download utilities such as `curl.exe` or `wget.exe`, or PowerShell commands like `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Start-BitsTransfer`, are used in conjunction with recognized Microsoft domains. The monitoring primarily relies on process creation logs, examining the command line arguments for suspicious patterns that indicate the downloading of files.
  This rule is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Command and Control (T1071) and Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel (T1105), specifically targeting techniques utilized by adversaries to exfiltrate data via trusted environments. By scrutinizing these downloads, security teams can discover abnormal behavior that may indicate an intrusion or malicious act.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to review process creation logs for the identified download utilities (`curl.exe`, `wget.exe`, etc.), focusing on command line parameters and parent-child process relationships to understand the context in which downloads were initiated.
  - **Review Network Traffic:** Inspect network connection logs using NDR tools to monitor any outbound connections to the specified Microsoft domains, verifying the nature and volume of traffic during the incident window.
  - **Analyze User Activity Logs:** Check logs from Microsoft 365 (or equivalent services) to correlate the download activity with user actions, ensuring no legitimate access to correspondence or attachments coincided with the suspicious downloads.
  - **Evaluate Related System Events:** Investigate Windows Event Logs, especially focusing on Security and Application logs, for any unauthorized access or changes that may relate to the incident, such as unusual logon patterns or anomalies in the usage of file sharing functionalities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a high severity level as it indicates possible exfiltration or malicious activity leveraging trusted Microsoft environments. Given the confidence in the rule's parameters, any triggered alert warrants immediate investigation to mitigate potential data breaches or prevent further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are inherent limitations in detecting all legitimate uses of the identified commands, as many internal tools or scripts may require such downloads for valid operational purposes, leading to false positives. Furthermore, the rule may not fire if an adversary employs obfuscation techniques, modifies command syntax, or uses alternative tools for file downloads. It assumes that the monitoring infrastructure can capture and analyze process creation logs effectively; if logging is insufficient or disabled on systems, the rule may not detect all relevant activities.

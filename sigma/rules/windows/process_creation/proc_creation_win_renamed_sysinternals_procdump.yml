  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed ProcDump Execution" detection rule identifies the execution of ProcDump executables that may have been renamed, a common tactic employed by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms. ProcDump, a utility for creating process dumps, may be renamed to evade detection when leveraged maliciously for data exfiltration or analysis of application behaviors without raising alarms. This Sigma rule utilizes Windows process creation logs, specifically focusing on the execution of processes where the original filename is identified as 'procdump' and the command line contains flags associated with dump creation, such as '-ma' for full memory dumps or '-mp' for mini memory dumps. 
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1083) and the technique of Renamed Executable (T1036.003). By flagging instances of ProcDump execution that meet the defined criteria, security teams are empowered to identify potential misuse or malicious intent behind the activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Details:** Check the process execution details in EDR to identify when and by whom the renamed ProcDump was executed, including timestamps and parent processes.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line arguments within the process creation logs to determine if any suspicious flags or configurations were used.
  - **Correlate Events:** Look for network connections or file activity related to the execution of the renamed ProcDump to ascertain whether data was exfiltrated or modified.
  - **Audit Known Applications:** Review your environment for legitimate applications that may have bundled ProcDump, particularly if the execution fell under permissible software within the organization.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for abuse of a legitimate tool often used in security testing or monitoring, making it particularly critical for incident responders to investigate quickly as it may indicate advanced threat activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger if the adversary utilizes an alternate method to execute ProcDump that does not involve renaming the executable, or if it employs other tools with similar functionalities that are not monitored. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate administrative actions where staff may have renamed ProcDump for internal processes. Investigators should remain aware of benign contexts to avoid unnecessary escalation.

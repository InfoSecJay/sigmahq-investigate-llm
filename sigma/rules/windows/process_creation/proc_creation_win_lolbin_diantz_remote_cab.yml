  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activity related to the use of the `diantz.exe` command-line utility, which is commonly used for compressing files into a CAB format on Windows systems. The rule triggers when the command line of a process creation event contains `diantz.exe`, a UNC path (indicated by `\\`), and a filename ending with `.cab`. By looking for these specific parameters, the rule identifies potential command-and-control (C2) activities where an adversary may download files from a remote location, compress them, and store them locally for further exploitation or lateral movement. The identification of these actions can be critical in thwarting potential breaches or attack scenarios corresponding to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query Process Creation Logs:** Use the SIEM to filter Windows process creation logs for instances of `diantz.exe` being executed, especially focusing on the timestamp and user account associated with the process.
  - **Review Network Activities:** Investigate network logs to identify any unusual outbound connections that occurred prior to the execution of `diantz.exe`, particularly those connecting to uncommon remote servers or utilizing UNC paths.
  - **Analyze File System Changes:** Check the filesystem for newly created `.cab` files in user directories or other unusual locations, monitoring their contents and associations.
  - **Assess User Behavior:** Investigate the user or service account that executed the command for anomalies, reviewing its recent activities and correlating with other security alerts or patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for misuse of the `diantz.exe` tool in conducting unauthorized file downloads, which may indicate an ongoing or attempted compromise. Rapid investigation is encouraged to determine the legitimacy of the activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `diantz.exe` is executed without the specified command-line parameters or if it operates in a benign manner not associated with malicious intent. Moreover, legitimate applications or tools that use similar naming conventions can generate false positives. Additionally, the rule assumes that appropriate logging is enabled for process creation events, meaning environments with insufficient telemetry may miss detection entirely. Attackers may also obfuscate their methods or use alternative tools to avoid detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially suspicious activity involving the use of the `diantz.exe` utility on Windows systems. The `diantz.exe` command is known for downloading files from remote locations and compressing them into a CAB file, which can be a method for exfiltrating or obfuscating malicious content. The rule checks for command-line parameters that include the execution of `diantz.exe`, paths that indicate remote file sources (noted by the presence of double backslashes), and the `.cab` file extension. These indicators are crucial in tracking unauthorized downloads or data manipulation that may be indicative of malicious command-and-control activity.
  The primary data sources utilized for this detection rule include process creation logs, which record details about running processes and their command-line arguments. By monitoring these logs, the security operations team can detect the execution of `diantz.exe` with configurations that may signal a threat, allowing for rapid incident response.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the EDR logs for alerts associated with the execution of `diantz.exe` and analyze the command-line parameters used. This can reveal the source of the download and the intended destination of the CAB file.
  - Examine network traffic logs to identify any unusual outbound connections or data transfers correlated with the usage of `diantz.exe`. This can help determine if there was communication with a suspicious external server.
  - Check the local file system for any newly created or modified CAB files, particularly in unusual directories. This can provide insights into the potential exfiltrated data or files of interest.
  - Investigate user activity logs in conjunction with the detection to ascertain whether the behavior was expected for the user and if there are any other associated incidents or anomalies.

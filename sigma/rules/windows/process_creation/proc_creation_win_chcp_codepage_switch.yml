  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious CodePage Switch Via CHCP" aims to detect potentially malicious code execution that involves switching the command line code page to a rare language setting. Adversaries may use this tactic to obfuscate their scripts or commands, making them less recognizable by traditional security mechanisms. This rule focuses on the execution of `chcp.com`, a command used to change the code page number, specifically looking for command lines that end with certain identifiers corresponding to less common languages, such as Vietnamese (1258) and simplified Chinese (936). The rule taps into process creation logs, capturing parameters used in the command line to identify suspicious actions. This technique relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of **Defense Evasion** under technique **T1036**, aiming to conceal malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Verify the instances of `chcp.com` execution within the process creation logs using your SIEM to find any corresponding unusual code page switches.
  - **Examine Parent CommandLine**: Investigate the parent process associated with the alert to understand the context of the command execution and whether it originated from a legitimate administrative action.
  - **Cross-check with EDR**: Utilize your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool to analyze the behavior of the alerted process for any additional signs of compromise or malicious activity.
  - **Assess Administrative Activities**: Correlate the alert with known administrative activities within your organization to identify any false positives arising from legitimate configuration changes.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential risk associated with code page switching, which can indicate attempts to evade detection. While it may represent legitimate administrative actions, it warrants careful investigation to rule out malicious behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that all instances of `chcp.com` file execution are being logged correctly and that any corresponding parameters are accurately captured. There is a risk of false negatives if an attacker implements obfuscation techniques that do not utilize the monitored command or if they perform their activities in different contexts or through alternate methods that do not involve changing code pages. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities may generate false positives, necessitating careful review.

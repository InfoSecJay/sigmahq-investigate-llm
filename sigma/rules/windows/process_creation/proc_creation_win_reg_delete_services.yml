  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies attempts to delete service registry keys using the "reg.exe" utility, specifically when the command line contains the flags for deletion. Attackers often leverage this technique to disable or remove security software on compromised systems, thus evading established defenses. The rule relies on process creation logs from Windows systems, focusing on the invocation of `reg.exe` with `delete` parameters targeting registry paths that pertain to services. The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic is Defense Evasion, specifically the technique T1562.001, which outlines methods used by adversaries to disable or bypass defenses.
  The detection mechanism analyzes key attributes from the process creation log such as the command line arguments and the image name involved in the operation. If a command is detected that matches the criteria indicating a service registry key deletion, an alert will be generated for further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to review the process creation logs surrounding the alert time, focusing on instances of `reg.exe` being executed and the associated command line parameters.
  - **Check for Other Related Indicators:** Investigate for any other malicious activities occurring within the same timeframe, such as unusual process creations or network connections, which could indicate a broader compromise.
  - **Review Service Status:** Examine the current status of services on the affected system to determine if any security software was indeed disabled or removed in conjunction with the detected registry delete command.
  - **Correlate with User Activity Logs:** Assess user logs to identify who executed the `reg.exe` command, focusing on any anomalies in user behavior, especially if the command was executed by an account with elevated privileges.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert indicates a high-severity event, the deletion of service registry keys via `reg.exe` poses a serious risk to operating system security, particularly when it relates to disabling antivirus functionalities. Immediate investigation is warranted to prevent potential exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where attackers employ alternate methods or tools other than `reg.exe` to delete service entries, or if the deletion command is obfuscated. Additionally, if the event logs are not comprehensive due to misconfiguration or log clearing tactics, the detection may fail. It's assumed that the environment is correctly configured to generate and retain sufficient telemetry from Windows process creation events.

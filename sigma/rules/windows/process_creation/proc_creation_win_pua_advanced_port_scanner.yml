  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of the Advanced Port Scanner application, which can be utilized by adversaries for reconnaissance to identify open ports on networked systems. The rule scrutinizes process creation logs, particularly the image name and associated command-line parameters, to spot instances of the Advanced Port Scanner. By focusing on specific characteristics, such as the executable name containing "advanced_port_scanner" and particular command-line options like '/portable' and '/lng', the rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Discovery (T1046) and Scanning (T1135). This proactive detection helps in identifying unauthorized scanning activities within the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Inspect Windows Security event logs for suspicious process creation events associated with the Advanced Port Scanner, ensuring you note the parent process and user context.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Evaluate command-line arguments in the Windows event logs to confirm if they contain any of the specified flags (e.g., '/portable', '/lng') indicative of the advanced scanning operations.
  - **Cross-Reference Network Traffic:** Utilize EDR or NDR tools to scrutinize any resulting network connections for unusual port scans or elevated activity that corresponds with the execution time of the identified port scanner.
  - **Inspect User Behavior:** Check for patterns of legitimate use in your organization. Validate whether the user has the necessary administration rights and if the tool was utilized for regular administrative activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is considered medium due to the potential risk advanced port scanning poses. While it may sometimes indicate legitimate administrative practices, it can also signify an adversary preparing for further exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There may be scenarios where this rule might not trigger an alert, such as when port scanning tools are operated in ways that do not match the defined criteria or if the application has been renamed. Additionally, some legitimate administrative actions might trigger false positives due to administrative use of similar command-line tools. Analysts must remain aware that sophisticated adversaries could employ custom scripts or obfuscate their tools to evade detection.

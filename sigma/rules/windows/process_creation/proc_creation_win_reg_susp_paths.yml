  ### Technical Context
  The "Reg Add Suspicious Paths" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity related to registry manipulation using the `reg.exe` utility. This utility, often leveraged by attackers for evasion and persistence, allows users to create or modify registry keys which can impact system behavior. The rule specifically monitors for the invocation of `reg.exe` with command-line parameters that target known suspicious registry paths, including areas that may pertain to security provider manipulations, application data, and default settings related to Windows login behavior. The technical data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, specifically focusing on the image name and the command-line arguments associated with the execution of `reg.exe`. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1562.001) and the use of system registry modifications (T1112).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs for process creation events, specifically filtering for entries related to `reg.exe` and note the associated command-line arguments.
  - **Check Threat Intelligence Sources:** Cross-reference the suspicious registry paths observed in the command-line parameters against threat intelligence databases to ascertain known indicators of compromise.
  - **Inspect Registry Changes:** Use a system monitoring tool or script to investigate recent changes in the specified registry paths to determine any unauthorized modifications or additions.
  - **Engage EDR for Behavioral Analysis:** Utilize endpoint detection tools to identify any user or system behaviors that may correlate with the timeline of the registry modifications, looking for unusual activities across the environment.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for substantial impact on system integrity and security; unauthorized changes to the registry can facilitate persistence mechanisms or bypass security controls, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where the `reg.exe` executable is not observable due to deletions, renaming, or if commands are executed from alternate means (e.g., scripts or other binaries mimicking `reg.exe`). The detection could also be bypassed if legitimate processes make necessary changes during standard operations, indicating a reliance on contextual information that may not always be present. Additionally, it assumes that users are not consistently modifying these registry paths for legitimate purposes, which could lead to false positives and require careful analysis to discern true threats.

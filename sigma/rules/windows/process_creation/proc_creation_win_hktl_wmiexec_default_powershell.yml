  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - Wmiexec Default Powershell Command" is designed to identify the execution of a PowerShell command that utilizes specific flags associated with the Wmiexec script, a commonly exploited tool for lateral movement in a network. The rule focuses on detecting PowerShell process creation events wherein the command line includes the terms '-NoP', '-NoL', '-sta', '-NonI', '-W Hidden', '-Exec Bypass', and '-Enc'. These flags are typically used to obfuscate the execution of malicious scripts, allowing adversaries to carry out unauthorized commands remotely while evading detection.
  The main data source for this detection rule is based on Windows process creation logs, specifically monitoring for the execution of PowerShell with the aforementioned flags. When an alert is generated, responders can trace back to the initial point of execution using log sources like Sysmon or Windows event logs. This ties into MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) and T1059.001 (PowerShell), which encompass tactics related to defense evasion and lateral movement.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Inspect the Windows Sysmon and Event Logs for any recent PowerShell executions that match the flagged command sequence. Determine the user and process context for additional insight.
  - **Correlate with EDR Events:** Utilize the EDR tool to analyze the process tree and behavioral anomalies linked to the detected PowerShell execution, focusing on any unusual parent-child relationships or suspicious processes spawned during the timeframe.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Check network logs for any outbound connections initiated from the host executing the PowerShell command. Look for anomalies or connections to known malicious domains or IP addresses that may indicate an exfiltration attempt or communication with a command-and-control server.
  - **Examine PowerShell Transcripts:** If available, review PowerShell transaction logs (transcription) to understand what commands were formulated and executed through Wmiexec, providing context to the scope of actions taken by the attacker.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential for the detected activity to signify an active, unauthorized lateral movement attempt within the enterprise environment. Given the common use of Wmiexec for exploitation, quick response and investigation are critical.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule relies heavily on proper logging configuration across the enterprise landscape; if Sysmon or relevant Windows Event Logs are not enabled or adequately configured, the rule may fail to trigger. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may modify command line parameters or obfuscate their payloads to evade detection, resulting in false negatives. Analysts should also be cautious of legitimate administrative activities that may utilize similar command sequences.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed Gpg.EXE Execution" Sigma rule is designed to detect attempts to execute a renamed instance of the `gpg.exe` executable, which is often associated with encryption and decryption functionalities. This behavior is particularly concerning in enterprise environments, as threat actors may leverage this executable for malicious activities, such as ransomware attacks or data exfiltration. The rule works by analyzing process creation logs, specifically focusing on the `OriginalFileName` property to identify legitimate instances of `gpg.exe`. It further filters the logs to exclude processes whose image paths do not match the expected filenames, effectively reducing false positives from benign software that may rely on similarly named files. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1486, which pertains to data encrypted for impact.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine the process creation logs corresponding to the time of the alert. Identify any suspicious processes launched with `gpg.exe` or its renamed variants.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters associated with the detected execution. Look for indicators of ransomware behavior, such as unusual file paths or encryption flags.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use NDR tools to check for any outbound network connections made by the identified process. Investigate for any connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  - **Check for File System Changes:** Monitor file activities on the endpoint using Sysmon or file integrity monitoring solutions. Identify any encrypted or renamed files that could indicate data exfiltration or ransomware operations.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule should be treated with high severity due to the potential implications of ransomware or data exfiltration activities in an enterprise environment. Quick investigation is crucial to mitigate risks and prevent data loss.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious actor employs alternate names for `gpg.exe`, evading detection through this specific filter. Additionally, if the process is executed within a legitimate context or through obfuscation techniques, the alerts may be missed entirely. It's also important to note that variations in the environment's software landscape, such as custom installations or unique naming conventions, may lead to a lower detection rate.

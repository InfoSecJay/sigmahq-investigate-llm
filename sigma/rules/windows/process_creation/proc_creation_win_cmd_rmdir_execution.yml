title: Directory Removal Via Rmdir
id: 41ca393d-538c-408a-ac27-cf1e038be80c
status: test
description: |
  Detects execution of the builtin "rmdir" command in order to delete directories.
  Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity.
  Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how.
  Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the execution of the built-in "rmdir" command, which is used to remove directories in Windows environments. The rule focuses on process creation logs, specifically looking for instances where the command line of `cmd.exe` indicates the use of "rmdir" with specific flags such as "/s" for recursive deletion and "/q" for quiet mode, which suppresses confirmation prompts. This behavior is often associated with adversaries attempting to cleanse traces of their activities or remove files left behind after a compromise, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1070.004). The detection hinges on monitoring process creation events to capture the context and parameters used in command executions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the Windows Security Event Logs for entries related to the execution of `cmd.exe` to confirm the occurrence of the "rmdir" command.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line parameters used in conjunction with the "rmdir" command to understand the intent (e.g., whether the deletion was recursive or forced).
  - **Correlate with File Activity:** Use EDR tools to correlate the execution of the "rmdir" command with file operations to identify what directories or files may have been deleted.
  - **Review User and Process Context:** Investigate the user account and process context under which the command was executed to determine if the operation was authorized or indicative of malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is categorized as low because while the use of "rmdir" can be benign in normal administrative tasks, it may also indicate an attempt to erase traces of malicious activity which warrants further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire under certain conditions, such as if an adversary uses alternative methods to delete directories (e.g., using PowerShell cmdlets or other scripting languages) or employs elevated privileges to execute commands without the use of `cmd.exe`. Additionally, if command-line logging is not enabled or if logging is inadequate, this detection may fail to trigger. Analysts should assume that sophisticated adversaries might utilize various techniques to remain stealthy and may avoid using common commands that are easily monitored.

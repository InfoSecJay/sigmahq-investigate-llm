  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Memory Dumping Activity Via LiveKD" aims to detect the execution of the LiveKD utility, a tool used for memory analysis and debugging in Windows environments. Specifically, this rule monitors process creation events for instances where the LiveKD executable (`livekd.exe` or `livekd64.exe`) is run, as indicated by its image name and original file name. The monitoring typically leverages Windows process creation logs, capturing critical details like the process name, its source, and other associated metadata. 
  This rule falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and focuses on techniques that adversaries may utilize to evade detection while attempting to analyze memory or extract sensitive information from running processes. Being aware of the execution of such tools is crucial for incident responders, as they could indicate potential malicious activity, such as an adversary preparing for further exploitation or data exfiltration.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation events in Windows logs to confirm that `livekd.exe` or `livekd64.exe` was executed, noting the user context and any parent processes involved.
    
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize your EDR solution to check for any alerts related to the execution of LiveKD, including any suspicious patterns or indicators of other malicious activities that may be associated.
    
  - **Analyze Related Network Activity:** Investigate any network connections established during the execution of LiveKD by checking firewall and network logs to identify unusual outbound traffic or communication with known malicious IPs.
    
  - **Determine Legitimate Use Cases:** Identify if the execution of LiveKD aligns with any legitimate administrative tasks or debugging processes within your organization by consulting with the relevant teams. 
  ### Prioritization
  The alert's medium severity arises from the tool's legitimate use in administrative tasks highlighted by a potential for misuse by attackers. Investigating instances where LiveKD is executed is vital to understand the context of its usage to differentiate between normal operations and suspicious activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The primary blind spot for this rule is that legitimate system administrators may use LiveKD for troubleshooting, which can trigger false positives. Additionally, if an adversary renames the executable or lays down a modified version, the detection may fail. There is also an assumption that the telemetry from process creation logs will provide sufficient context for every incident; cases where log retention settings are misconfigured could lead to missed detections.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule “Potential UAC Bypass Via Sdclt.EXE” focuses on identifying instances where the Windows utility `sdclt.exe` (System Data Collector) is executed with elevated privileges, specifically at a high integrity level. This behavior is considered suspicious as it may indicate an adversary’s attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) mechanisms using this utility. The rule is primarily triggered by checking the process creation logs for instances of `sdclt.exe` and evaluating its integrity level against known high values. Such activities are categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Privilege Escalation" (T1548.002), which highlights techniques that actors may employ to elevate their privileges without proper authorization. Logs from Windows Sysmon are crucial data sources for this detection, as they provide detailed insights into process creation and associated attributes, allowing analysts to identify unusual patterns indicative of evasion efforts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the process creation logs related to `sdclt.exe` on the affected host to examine the command-line parameters, parent processes, and user context to determine if the execution pattern is legitimate or malicious.
  - **Assess Integrity Levels:** Utilize Sysmon logs to verify the integrity level of the `sdclt.exe` process. Investigate any anomalies, especially if the integrity level is reported as high, which is not typical for this application.
  - **Correlate with Other Events:** Cross-reference the time of the `sdclt.exe` execution with other security events in the SIEM, such as failed login attempts or suspicious network connections, to identify potential lateral movement or a more extensive attack framework.
  - **Review User Behavior:** Analyze the user account associated with the execution of `sdclt.exe` to establish if this behavior aligns with normal user operations or if indicators of compromise (IoCs) suggest malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the significant risk that elevated processes imply in an enterprise environment. Elevated commands executed through `sdclt.exe` may indicate initial-access attempts or privilege escalation efforts, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There may be legitimate use cases for `sdclt.exe` running at high integrity levels, such as administrative tasks or system updates, which could generate false positives. Additionally, if an adversary modifies process metadata or mimics legitimate system processes, this detection rule may not trigger. It's crucial for engineers to be aware that overly aggressive security measures could lead to overlooking authorized administrative actions.

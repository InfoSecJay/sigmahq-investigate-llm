  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Process Parents" Sigma rule is designed to detect instances of potentially malicious processes that exhibit unusual or suspicious parent-child process relationships on Windows systems. This rule focuses primarily on the behavior of specific parent processes known to be leveraged by attackers for code execution and other malicious activities, such as `minesweeper.exe`, `winver.exe`, and `bitsadmin.exe`. The detection logic captures any child processes spawned by these parent processes, particularly when they yield unexpected children or allow only certain legitimate child processes such as `WerFault.exe` or `Notepad.exe`. 
  By monitoring process creation events, this rule taps into telemetry provided by Windows Security logs to evaluate parent-child relationships, adhering to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" and the corresponding technique (T1036). Utilizing this approach, analysts can identify anomalous behavior indicative of potential evasion tactics employed by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Parent-Child Relationships:** Check the process creation logs within your EDR to identify any instances where suspicious parent processes spawned unexpected child processes. 
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Review relevant logs from firewall, proxy, and VPN to correlate network activity with the identified suspicious processes to determine if exfiltration or command and control activities were carried out.
  - **Check File Integrity:** Employ file integrity monitoring tools to validate that the identified processes and their parent processes have not been tampered with or replaced with malicious versions.
  - **Assess Threat Intelligence:** Refer to threat intelligence platforms to ascertain if the observed parent processes have been previously linked to known malicious activities or specific adversary techniques.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the rule's focus on high-risk parent processes and the implications of process tampering, alerts generated from this rule should be regarded as high severity. This is due to the potential for these processes to be used in conjunction with other malicious activities, posing a significant threat to enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where the monitored parent processes have been disabled or blocked, thus preventing any child processes from being generated. Additionally, if attackers deploy custom or lesser-known processes as parents, this rule would likely fail to detect their activities. The assumption that legitimate child processes like `Notepad.exe` or `WerFault.exe` are safe could also lead to blind spots if they are invoked as part of malicious activity. Analysts should be cognizant of various attack vectors and understand that gaining deeper insights into process relationships may require supplemental monitoring and cross-tool investigations.

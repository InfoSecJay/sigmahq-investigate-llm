title: Uncommon FileSystem Load Attempt By Format.com
id: 9fb6b26e-7f9e-4517-a48b-8cac4a1b6c60
status: test
description: |
  Detects the execution of format.com with an uncommon filesystem selection that could indicate a defense evasion activity in which "format.com" is used to load malicious DLL files or other programs.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Uncommon FileSystem Load Attempt By Format.com" is designed to detect potential defense evasion tactics where the Windows utility `format.com` is misused to execute and load malicious files. This rule focuses specifically on instances where `format.com` is invoked with uncommon filesystem parameters. The main data sources utilized for this detection are process creation logs that capture the execution of commands and their command-line parameters. The rule looks for process creation events where the image name ends with `format.com` and the command line includes a `/fs:` argument that does not match the most common filesystem types (e.g., exFAT, FAT, NTFS, ReFS, UDF). 
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically targeting the Defense Evasion tactic (T1562), where adversaries attempt to evade defenses by utilizing legitimate system binaries in unexpected ways. Detecting this anomaly can indicate an attempt to execute unauthorized or harmful code under the guise of a standard Windows utility.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Utilize EDR tools to identify the specific instances of `format.com` execution, focusing on the command-line arguments used in conjunction with process creation logs.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command-line details of the alert to confirm whether the used filesystem is uncommon and understand the context behind its usage.
  - **Cross-Reference with Other Logs:** Check Windows Security and Application logs for any related activities or anomalies that might correlate with the execution of `format.com`, such as malware indicators or user context.
  - **Check for Low-Frequency Detections:** Assess other threat intelligence sources or logs for recent incidents involving `format.com` to determine if this behavior has been observed elsewhere, which could indicate a broader threat.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high priority due to the potential for significant impact if malicious activities leveraging `format.com` are underway, which could result in data loss or compromise of system integrity within the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary employs variations of the command or utilizes alternate methods to invoke `format.com` without the flagged command-line parameters. Additionally, if `format.com` is renamed or if other legitimate applications utilize similar operation methods without triggering the detection criteria, the alert may not be activated. It's also assumed that all relevant process creation logs are being properly captured and retained for analysis.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is focused on detecting the execution of the PurpleSharp adversary simulation tool on Windows systems. PurpleSharp is a legitimate tool used for simulating adversarial techniques and is often employed in security assessments. The rule captures specific indicators indicating the presence of PurpleSharp, including executable filenames and command-line parameters. Specifically, it looks for instances of "PurpleSharp.exe" when analyzing process creation logs, as well as command-line arguments that include "PurpleSharp" or other specified values. The detection directly correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of resource development (T1587), which covers the creation and development of tools that can be used in cyber operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Logs:** Review the process creation logs in Windows Event Logs to verify the execution of "PurpleSharp.exe" and understand the context of its use within the environment.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line history associated with the identified processes to determine if legitimate or suspicious activities are linked with the execution of PurpleSharp.
  - **Review System Changes:** Utilize EDR tools to assess any unexpected changes to the system configuration or environment as a result of running the PurpleSharp tool, including file modifications or unusual network connections.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference findings with other telemetry sources such as firewall logs, proxy logs, and any cloud logs to identify whether the execution corresponds with known malicious behavior or unauthorized data access attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as critical due to the potential for PurpleSharp to be utilized by adversaries for testing and executing attacks, indicating a severe risk to the organization's security posture if unauthorized usage is confirmed.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where defenders have whitelisted PurpleSharp for testing purposes, which could lead to bypassing the detection. Additionally, if the adversary modifies the name or location of the PurpleSharp executable or uses alternative command-line arguments, the detection may fail. Analysts should also consider environments where logging may not capture all process creation events, potentially resulting in missed detections.

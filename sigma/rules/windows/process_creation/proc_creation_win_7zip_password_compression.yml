  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets a potential adversarial behavior related to data exfiltration by monitoring for the use of 7-Zip, a widely used file compression utility. The rule works by identifying process creation events related to 7-Zip, specifically looking for instances where the command-line arguments indicate that data is being compressed or encrypted with a password (indicated by the `-p` switch). This behavior, highlighted in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic "Collection" (T1560.001), signifies an attempt to obscure information before it is sent outside of the organization. The relevant data sources for this detection include process creation logs which provide information such as the command-line parameters utilized by the 7-Zip executables (`7z.exe`, `7za.exe`, and `7zr.exe`). By correlating these logs with specific command parameters that facilitate exfiltration, security teams can identify potentially malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in EDR to identify instances of the 7-Zip executables (`7z.exe`, `7za.exe`, `7zr.exe`) being executed, along with their corresponding command-line arguments.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Look specifically for instances where the command line includes the use of the password switch `-p`, indicating potential password-protected compressions which may suggest malicious intent.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize network logs (NDR/NGFW) to determine if there was subsequent outbound network traffic that aligns with the timing of the compressed file creation, which can indicate exfiltration attempts.
  - **Assess User Account Behavior:** Investigate the user account associated with the process to determine if the account shows signs of compromise or unusual behavior, such as executing multiple compression tasks or accessing sensitive files.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is rated as medium severity given that while legitimate use of 7-Zip for file compression is common, its association with password protection raises concern about potential data exfiltration, warranting further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where alternative compression tools are used or if legitimate users employ 7-Zip without utilizing the password protection feature, thus evading detection. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes customized or obfuscated command flags while executing compression, the detection may also fail. It is assumed that the environments regularly use 7-Zip; if this is not a typical tool in your organization, then numerous false positives can occur as legitimate use of 7-Zip is common.

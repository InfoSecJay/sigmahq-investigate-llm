  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious CustomShellHost Execution" rule aims to detect potential misuse of the CustomShellHost binary by monitoring process creation events in a Windows environment. Specifically, it looks for instances where a process with the parent image set to `CustomShellHost.exe` is spawned, but the child process is not `C:\Windows\explorer.exe`. This behavior may indicate an attempt by an attacker to utilize the CustomShellHost for malicious purposes while evading detection. As this rule operates primarily on Windows process creation logs, it leverages telemetry from Sysmon that captures detailed information about the execution context of processes, including parent-child relationships. The rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1216) which covers techniques that adversaries use to hide their presence or hinder detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Creation Timeline:** Check the process creation logs using EDR to establish a timeline of when the CustomShellHost process was created and what commands were executed during its runtime.
  - **Analyze Parent-Child Process Relationships:** Utilize Sysmon logs to analyze the parent-child relationships of processes to verify if any anomalous child processes were spawned from the CustomShellHost executable.
  - **Review Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Utilize threat intelligence feeds to check if the observed execution of CustomShellHost aligns with known malicious indicators or behaviors.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Examine network logs (NDR/Firewall) for any suspicious outbound connections that were initiated by the CustomShellHost process or its children, as this can indicate exfiltration or command and control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered to have a medium severity due to the potential risks associated with the execution of CustomShellHost, particularly in scenarios where it is employed as a mechanism for malicious activity. Organizations should prioritize investigations to rule out any potential security breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Several conditions can lead to the failure of this rule to trigger. If the attacker modifies the parent-child process behavior or utilizes alternative methods to execute the desired actions, such as running `CustomShellHost.exe` in a different context, the rule may not detect it. Furthermore, environments where Sysmon is not properly integrated or where logging levels are insufficient may miss key process creation events necessary for this detection. It is important for detection engineers to ensure comprehensive logging configurations are utilized and to remain aware of potential evasion techniques used by adversaries.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "New Firewall Rule Added Via Netsh.EXE" aims to detect instances where new rules are added to the Windows Firewall using the 'netsh' command-line utility. This rule specifically looks for process creation events where `netsh.exe` is executed with command-line arguments indicating an attempt to add firewall rules. By monitoring command-line parameters, the rule identifies modifications related to firewall configurations, which may indicate defensive evasion tactics employed by threats or misconfigurations that could compromise network security. The technical data sources used in this rule include process creation logs that capture the execution of `netsh.exe` and its associated command-line arguments, ensuring comprehensive monitoring of potentially unauthorized firewall modifications. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for defense evasion (T1562.004) and sub-technique (S0246).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process Source:** Check the EDR logs for details on the process creation event, specifically looking at the parent processes to understand what triggered `netsh.exe`.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line parameters of the `netsh.exe` execution in the process creation logs to identify any suspicious rules being added to the firewall.
  - **Cross-Reference with Organizational Policy:** Compare the detected firewall rule changes with your organization's standard firewall configuration policies to determine if the activity was authorized or potentially malicious.
  - **Perform a Network Review:** Use network logs to analyze traffic behaviors before and after the rule was added, ensuring no illicit connections or communications were established.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized with a medium severity level due to the potential for misuse of firewall configurations, which could expose sensitive network segments or allow unauthorized communications. It is essential to investigate further to ascertain the legitimacy of the firewall changes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `netsh.exe` is not used for firewall modifications, or if users have legitimate reasons to alter firewall rules. Additionally, it assumes that malicious users will execute `netsh.exe` directly rather than through a script or other means that may bypass detection. As a result, engineers should be cautious of rapidly changing security controls or configurations that might not be reflected in traditional process creation monitoring.

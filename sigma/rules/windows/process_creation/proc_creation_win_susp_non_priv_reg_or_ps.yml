  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activities related to the Windows Registry and PowerShell usage, specifically when non-privileged users attempt to modify service configurations. The rule monitors process creation events, particularly looking for command line arguments that invoke the `reg add` command or specific PowerShell cmdlets such as `Set-ItemProperty` and `New-ItemProperty`. These actions can indicate an unauthorized attempt to alter critical system settings or service configurations, which may be part of a broader privilege escalation or defense evasion tactic. The detected activities are logged through Windows process creation logs, leveraging attributes like `IntegrityLevel` to ensure that the modifications are initiated from a medium integrity level, which is commonly associated with non-privileged users. This relates directly to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112 
  - Modify Registry).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the Windows Event Logs for process creations involving `reg add` or PowerShell commands that modify the registry, focusing on users with medium integrity levels.
  - **Evaluate Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command line parameters to determine the specific registry keys and values that were targeted during the modification attempts.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate the user accounts involved to ascertain whether their activities align with typical, authorized usage patterns or if they appear anomalous, indicating potential malicious intent.
  - **Review Related Security Alerts:** Use EDR tools to identify any additional alerts or suspicious activities within the timeframe of the registry modifications to understand the broader context of the incident.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this alert concerns potential unauthorized modifications to registry settings by non-privileged users, it is deemed high severity. Such actions can lead to significant security implications including unauthorized privilege escalation, potentially compromising systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious activities occur under a user with higher privileges or if advanced evasion techniques are employed to obfuscate command execution. Additionally, if legitimate user activities mimic these actions (such as software installations or updates), the rule may trigger false positives. It assumes there is an adequate logging configuration to capture the appropriate telemetry. Be aware that savvy adversaries may bypass detection by using custom scripts or other means to modify registry values without triggering the specified conditions.

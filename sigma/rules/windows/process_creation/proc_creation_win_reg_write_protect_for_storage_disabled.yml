status: test
description: |
  Detects applications trying to modify the registry in order to disable any write-protect property for storage devices.
  This could be a precursor to a ransomware attack and has been an observed technique used by cypherpunk group.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Write Protect For Storage Disabled" Sigma rule is designed to detect potential attempts by applications to modify the Windows Registry to disable write protection for storage devices. By interfering with the write protection setting, an attacker may be preparing to conduct unauthorized file alterations or data encryption, which is commonly associated with ransomware attacks. This rule looks for specific command-line parameters that indicate a process is trying to access the registry path `\System\CurrentControlSet\Control` and modify the write protection settings to `0`, effectively disabling this safeguard for storage devices. The relevant technical data sources include process creation logs, particularly focusing on command-line parameters associated with malicious intent. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1562 (Impair Defenses), which involves actions that evade or disable security mechanisms within a target system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Tree:** Examine the process tree of the detected alert using your EDR tool to identify the parent and child processes involved, looking for any suspicious or unusual activities that may indicate a broader compromise.
  - **Review Command-Line Execution:** Investigate the command-line execution details captured in the logs to discern the legitimacy of the process trying to disable write protection. Cross-reference it with known applications and their usage patterns in your environment.
  - **Correlate with File System Changes:** Use file integrity monitoring solutions or EDR capabilities to check for recent changes in file and folder permissions in conjunction with the registry modification attempt, which may suggest imminent data tampering.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Analyze network logs to identify any outbound connections made by the detected process, especially to suspicious domains or abnormal IP addresses, which might indicate command-and-control communications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to its potential indication of pre-ransomware behavior. Such activities signify a possible compromise that could lead to more severe incidents, necessitating prompt investigation to mitigate risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the registry modification is attempted using methods that do not involve direct command-line execution, such as via scripts or scheduled tasks that do not follow conventional paths. Additionally, false positives could arise from legitimate applications that modify registry settings for operational purposes, thus requiring context-driven review. It's assumed that typical user behavior does not involve such registry changes, although legitimate administrative tasks may occasionally necessitate similar actions. The rule also relies on the presence of the required telemetry; without it, detection capabilities are compromised.

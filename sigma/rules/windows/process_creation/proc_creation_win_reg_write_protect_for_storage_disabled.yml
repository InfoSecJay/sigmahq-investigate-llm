  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule targets suspicious modifications to the Windows registry that aim to disable write protection on storage devices. It specifically looks for process creation events that include command-line parameters indicating attempts to access the registry key associated with write protection settings. The rule checks for the presence of keywords like "Write Protection," "0," and "storage" within command-line arguments, signaling an intent to manipulate these settings. Such actions can be indicative of preparatory steps taken by threat actors before executing a ransomware attack, which may involve encrypting files on unprotected storage media. The relevant technical data sources for this alert include process creation logs and command-line parameters.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the process creation logs in your EDR system to identify the specific application that triggered this alert and examine its command-line parameters for anomalies. 
  - Cross-reference the applicationâ€™s hash against known malware databases to determine if it is recognized as malicious or should be further scrutinized.
  - Check the Windows registry on the affected system to verify if any unauthorized changes to the write protection settings have occurred.
  - Monitor related activities on the affected endpoints, such as file system modifications and unusual network traffic, to assess whether there are ongoing malicious operations.

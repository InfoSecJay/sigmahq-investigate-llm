  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious usage patterns in PowerShell command lines, particularly focusing on the use of encoded commands. Encoded commands often signify attempts to obfuscate the execution of malicious scripts, making them a common tactic among threat actors during infection chains. The rule specifically looks for PowerShell executables (both `powershell.exe` and `pwsh.exe`) combined with command-line flags indicating encoded commands, such as `-e`, `-en`, or `-enc`. Additionally, it checks for specific encoded content that may appear in malicious scripts. The rule leverages data from process creation logs to identify these patterns, correlating with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.001 (PowerShell). Detection of these behavior patterns may indicate an active infection or ongoing malicious activity, necessitating immediate investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Process Creation Events**: Use EDR to search for process creation events that match the identified patterns, paying close attention to command line arguments passed to PowerShell.
  - **Review Parent Process Context**: Analyze the parent processes of detected PowerShell executions to determine if they originated from suspicious or unexpected applications, particularly checking for `gc_worker.exe` contexts.
  - **Check Network Connections**: Investigate any outgoing network connections made by the PowerShell process to detect potential command and control (C2) communications that may have arisen from the encoded command execution.
  - **Analyze Related Security Logs**: Examine relevant Windows Security logs and Sysmon telemetry to identify any precursor indicators that may signal a broader security incident related to the PowerShell execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is considered high due to the covert nature of encoded PowerShell commands, which are frequently employed in sophisticated attacks. Such alerts warrant prompt attention as they may indicate active exploitation attempts or ongoing malicious activities within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where encoded scripts are executed through legitimate means or alternative tools that operate with encoded commands. Furthermore, if an adversary employs techniques such as remote execution or different command obfuscation methods, the rule might not detect these instances effectively. It's also assumed that power users or automated systems legitimately using encoded PowerShell commands (e.g., for system administration purposes) may generate false positives.

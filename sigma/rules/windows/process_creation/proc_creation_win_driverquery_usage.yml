  ### Technical Context
  The "DriverQuery.EXE Execution" rule is designed to detect the use of the "driverquery" utility in Windows environments, which can be employed by malware for reconnaissance purposes. This command-line tool can provide information about installed drivers, including their status and file paths, therefore giving adversaries insight into the system's configuration. The rule specifically looks for the creation of processes whose image ends with 'driverquery.exe' or 'drvqry.exe', while also filtering based on specific parent processes (such as `cscript.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and others) and suspicious file paths (e.g., `\AppData\Local\`, `\Users\Public\`). This approach is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactic of Discovery and technique T1087. This designation highlights its relevance to potential reconnaissance activity by threat actors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process Origin:** Check the process creation logs within your EDR for the source of the 'driverquery.exe' execution and inspect its parent processes to confirm if they are legitimate or potentially suspicious.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Examine any command-line parameters associated with the 'driverquery.exe' execution to see if any unusual flags or parameters were used that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Cross-reference User Context:** Investigate which user account executed the command by checking Windows Security logs. Determine if the user has legitimate reasons to run the utility, especially in unusual locations.
  - **Search for Related Activities:** Conduct a search for related network traffic or file system changes that might indicate further reconnaissance or malicious actions following the driver query execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium because, while 'driverquery.exe' can be legitimately used for system maintenance, its execution in suspicious contexts raises concerns about potential reconnaissance activities that may precede a more serious attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where the utility is invoked via a benign application or script that is pre-approved in the environment. Additionally, if an adversary uses alternate methods (such as PowerShell commands or direct API calls) to gather driver information, this rule will not trigger. The detection may also be ineffective if malicious users regularly utilize 'driverquery.exe' for legitimate purposes, leading to a higher number of false positives in those cases.

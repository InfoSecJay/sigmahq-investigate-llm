  in Microsoft Defender to detect a tool and thus used for AV evasion.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - DefenderCheck Execution" aims to detect instances where the DefenderCheck tool is executed on a Windows system. DefenderCheck is a utility designed to assess and analyze the signature strings that Microsoft Defender uses to detect potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) and malware. By understanding these detection signatures, malicious actors can engineer their payloads to evade detection. This rule leverages process creation logs to identify when the DefenderCheck executable (`DefenderCheck.exe`) is invoked, looking specifically for its image name and description. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic here is "Defense Evasion," particularly focusing on the technique ID T1027.005, which covers obfuscation and leveraging tools to bypass security mechanisms.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Check the process creation logs using EDR to confirm the source path of `DefenderCheck.exe`. Investigate if it was run from a legitimate location or a suspicious path.
  - **Review System Logs:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to assess any recent changes in system configurations that coincide with the execution of DefenderCheck. Look for unusual patterns that could indicate tampering.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Use NDR or firewall logs to inspect any outbound network connections initiated by the machine during or after the execution of DefenderCheck. Identify any connections to suspicious or known malicious domains.
  - **Check for Other Indicators:** Search for additional indicators related to the execution of DefenderCheck, including file or registry modifications, other related processes, or use of PowerShell commands that may indicate an attack chain.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is high due to the potential for misuse of the DefenderCheck tool by adversaries attempting to bypass AV defenses, indicating an active threat environment requiring immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if DefenderCheck is executed with a different executable name or from an unexpected location. We assume that the logging and monitoring of process creation events are properly configured. Additionally, if an adversary uses obfuscation techniques or manipulates the process under benign names, this rule may fail to trigger. Analysts should be aware that legitimate administrative activities may inadvertently lead to false positives, though these are deemed unlikely.

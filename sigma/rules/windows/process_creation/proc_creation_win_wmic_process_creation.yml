  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where a new process is being created via WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line), an often-abused tool for executing commands and interacting with Windows systems. The rule focuses on monitoring process creation events that involve the execution of `wmic.exe` with specific command-line parameters, particularly those that include the keywords "process," "call," and "create." This kind of activity is crucial to observe, as it may indicate unauthorized actions or attempts to leverage system management features for malicious purposes. The relevant data sources for this rule include process creation logs, which capture details about newly created processes, their command-line arguments, and the validating indicators that point towards potentially harmful behavior.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Check the process creation logs using the EDR tool to analyze the details of the processes invoked by `wmic.exe` and confirm whether the execution context appears legitimate.
  - Review command-line parameters associated with these events in your SIEM to identify any unusual patterns or known malicious commands that may suggest exploitation or evasion tactics.
  - Correlate findings with your AV and endpoint protection solutions to see if any related indicators of compromise (IoCs) or alerts were triggered during the time of the activity.
  - Investigate network logs (NDR/Proxy) for any corresponding outbound connections initiated by the process to detect potential data exfiltration or communication with known C2 (Command and Control) servers.

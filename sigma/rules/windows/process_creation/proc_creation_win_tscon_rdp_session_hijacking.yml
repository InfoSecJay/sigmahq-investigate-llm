  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session hijacking activities on Windows systems by monitoring process creation events associated with the `tscon.exe` executable. The `tscon.exe` utility is used to connect to a Remote Desktop session on Windows, and when observed under specific circumstances, it can indicate an unauthorized attempt to take over an existing RDP session. The rule focuses on two main characteristics: the process creation of `tscon.exe` and its execution at a high integrity level (System, S-1-16-16384), which may suggest manipulative or malicious behavior by potentially elevated privileges. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for Remote Services (T1021) under the tactic of Execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Identify the Process:** Use EDR tools to search for instances of `tscon.exe` being executed. Check the timing and context of the execution to establish if it correlates with user activity.
    
  - **Check User Context:** Investigate the user account under which the process was launched. Assess whether the account is commonly associated with administrative tasks or unusual behavior.
  - **Review Session Activity:** Query the Windows Security Event Logs for RDP logon events to confirm if there were any concurrent user sessions, which might indicate a session hijack.
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Utilize proxy and VPN logs to analyze remote access patterns that coincide with the `tscon.exe` process creation event, looking for unexpected access attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity, reflecting the potential risk associated with unauthorized access to RDP sessions. In an enterprise environment, successful session hijacking could lead to significant security compromises and data breaches if not swiftly investigated.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There may be blind spots in this detection rule where legitimate administrative activities—including remote support tasks—could generate false positives, as administrative teams often use RDP for system management. Additionally, the rule may not trigger if `tscon.exe` is executed with differing command-line arguments or if the process is created under other contexts. Furthermore, if an attacker utilizes different methods to establish RDP connections without directly invoking `tscon.exe`, such as custom tools, this rule would not detect those activities.

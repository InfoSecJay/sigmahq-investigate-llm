  Detects changes to Internet Explorer's (IE / Windows Internet properties) ZoneMap configuration of the "HTTP" and "HTTPS" protocols to point to the "My Computer" zone. This allows downloaded files from the Internet to be granted the same level of trust as files stored locally.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies unauthorized modifications to Internet Explorer's ZoneMap settings via command line interface (CLI). Specifically, it looks for instances where the ZoneMap configuration for the "HTTP" protocol is altered to point to the "My Computer" zone, which poses a significant security risk. Alterations of this kind allow files downloaded from the Internet to be treated with the same level of trust as those stored locally, greatly increasing the potential for malware execution and system compromise. The primary data source for this rule is the process creation log, particularly scrutinizing command line parameters that indicate such a change. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1203) and Defense Evasion (T1070), as it reflects an attempt to circumvent typical security controls through potentially malicious registry modifications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine process creation events in your EDR for any commands related to `Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\ProtocolDefaults` with the parameters indicating HTTP protocol modification.
  - **Analyze Related Network Activity:** Utilize NDR or firewall logs to detect any abnormal outbound traffic following the change which may signify an attempted malicious download or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
  - **Correlate with User Behavior:** Investigate the user account associated with the command execution; assess whether this activity is expected for the userâ€™s role or if it is anomalous in nature.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators:** Search through Windows Event Logs (Security, Application) for any related security warnings, errors, or other registry modifications that might align with suspicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for severe exploitation through unauthorized changes to security zones, alerts triggered by this rule are deemed high severity. The nature of the changes allows malicious files access to trusted system operations, indicating an immediate need for thorough investigation to prevent possible breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire under certain circumstances where the modification is performed through methods not captured by standard process creation logging, such as direct registry manipulation by an advanced threat actor or through legitimate software processes that do not generate typical event logs. Furthermore, if users have administrative privileges or if system security settings are misconfigured, attackers might evade detection by using more sophisticated means to alter system settings without alerting traditional logging mechanisms.

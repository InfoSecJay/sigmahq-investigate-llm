  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious File Encoded To Base64 Via Certutil.EXE" is designed to detect suspicious usage of the `certutil.exe` tool, specifically focusing on file encoding operations that may indicate potential malicious activities. `certutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for certificate management in Windows, but it can be exploited by attackers for encoding files in Base64, which is often a step in the obfuscation of payloads or artifacts. The rule captures events when `certutil.exe` is executed with the `-encode` option, combined with checks for certain suspicious file extensions (e.g., `.bat`, `.pdf`, `.exe`) that are commonly associated with malware delivery or operation. By monitoring process creation logs and analyzing command-line parameters, this rule identifies actions that align with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information), which falls under the defense evasion tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine process creation events for instances of `certutil.exe` running with the `-encode` flag, specifically targeting the identified suspicious file extensions.
  - **Analyze Command-Line History:** Utilize EDR systems to scrutinize command-line parameters and surrounding context of the `certutil.exe` execution to determine the intent and potential malicious purpose.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Check for any network connections or data exfiltration patterns that occurred immediately before and after the execution of the suspicious `certutil.exe` command.
  - **Review Endpoint Alerts:** Cross-reference alerts from antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response tools for any blocks or detections related to the file extensions flagged during the `certutil.exe` runs.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as high, indicating the potential for serious security threats given that attackers may utilize `certutil.exe` for encoding files as a means of evading detection. Quick investigation is crucial to mitigate any risk of data exfiltration or further malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate uses of `certutil.exe` occur frequently, leading to possible false positives. Additionally, if an adversary employs techniques to disguise their command-line usage (e.g., renaming `certutil.exe` or employing alternate encoding methods), the detection may fail. It is assumed that sufficient visibility exists across the necessary data sources; without comprehensive monitoring, the rule may not catch all instances of misuse.

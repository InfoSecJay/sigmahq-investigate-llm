title: Remote Access Tool - GoToAssist Execution
id: b6d98a4f-cef0-4abf-bbf6-24132854a83d
status: test
description: |
  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Remote Access Tool 
  - GoToAssist Execution" is designed to identify the execution of GoTo Opener, a legitimate remote access tool developed by LogMeIn, Inc. Adversaries often exploit this kind of software, which is typically used for remote support, to establish unauthorized command and control channels within target systems. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the description and product name match 'GoTo Opener', allowing security teams to identify potential misuse of the application in an organization's network. By focusing on telemetry such as process creation logs, the rule enables analysts to detect when this software is executed, potentially indicating an evasion tactic by malicious actors who leverage trusted applications for nefarious purposes. This relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of command and control, specifically technique T1219, which covers the usage of remote access tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize the EDR tool to review the process creation events for instances of the 'GoTo Opener'. Check for unexpected execution times and unusual parent-child process relationships.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate the associated user accounts in the Active Directory to determine if the execution aligns with legitimate remote support activities or if it appears anomalous.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Examine network logs for outbound connections associated with the 'GoTo Opener' process to identify any unusual communication patterns or destinations that could suggest C2 activity.
  - **Assess Application Whitelisting Policies:** Ensure that relevant application control policies correctly classify 'GoTo Opener' and consider whether adjustments to policies are needed due to its legitimate use in internal operations.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is deemed medium, as the execution of GoTo Opener could indicate either legitimate use for remote support or potential exploitation by an adversary. Prompt investigation is warranted to determine the context of the alert.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the GoTo Opener is not present on systems or if the adversary has disabled logging of process creation events. Additionally, legitimate uses of this software might result in false positives, particularly in environments where remote support tools are commonly utilized. Analysts should be aware that adversaries may also employ similar remote access tools that are not covered by this detection rule.

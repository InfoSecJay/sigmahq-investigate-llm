  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets potential reconnaissance activity utilizing the `nltest.exe` tool commonly employed for information discovery within a Windows environment. The rule identifies instances of `nltest` being executed with specific parameters related to server querying, particularly focusing on commands that include options such as `/user`, `all_trusts`, `dclist:`, and `dnsgetdc:`. The process creation logs sourced from Sysmon are primarily utilized to monitor and analyze the command-line parameters associated with `nltest.exe`, which can reveal attempts by threat actors to gather reputable domain data or enumerate domain trusts. 
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) and T1482 (Domain Trust Discovery). By monitoring such activities, SOC analysts can discern whether benign administrative tasks or malicious reconnaissance efforts are taking place within the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Investigate the Sysmon process creation logs to identify the execution of `nltest.exe` along with its command-line parameters. Pay close attention to the user context and associated parent processes.
  - **Assess User Activity**: Analyze the activity of the user who executed the command. Verify whether this user typically engages in administrative tasks that would warrant the use of `nltest`, or if this behavior is anomalous.
  - **Check for Lateral Movement**: Utilize EDR data to detect any subsequent connections or unusual access patterns originating from the host executing the `nltest` command. Look for any attempts to access or query trusted domains or resources.
  - **Look for Related Alerts**: Cross-reference the identified `nltest` execution with other security metrics such as DNS logs, network alerts, and authentication logs to determine if they correlate with known malicious activities or legitimate administrative behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a medium severity level, as the use of `nltest.exe` can indicate suspicious reconnaissance behaviors, but it also has legitimate administrative purposes. Analysts must contextualize the findings within the environment to appropriately prioritize their investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot for this rule is its reliance on the execution of `nltest.exe`; if an adversary employs alternate methods or tools for reconnaissance, this detection may not trigger. Additionally, legitimate tasks performed by administrators may produce false positives, necessitating a review of user and host behaviors during an investigation. There's an assumption that proper logging and monitoring of command-line arguments is in place; without adequate Sysmon configurations, the rule may not capture relevant data effectively.

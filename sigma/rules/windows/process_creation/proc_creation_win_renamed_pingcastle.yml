  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the execution of potentially malicious instances of the "PingCastle" binary, which is often misused by threat actors to compromise Windows domains. The rule analyzes process creation events to specifically look for renamed variants of PingCastle binaries—typically labeled as `PingCastleReporting.exe`, `PingCastleCloud.exe`, and `PingCastle.exe`—and examines their command-line parameters, which are indicative of various scanning operations against Active Directory environments. The detection leverages Windows Security event logs, which capture process creation, including the associated executable names and command-line arguments. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), where adversaries may leverage script execution to evade detection, and T1202 (Indirect Access), which can relate to scanning and probing activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Use EDR tools to confirm whether the identified PingCastle executables were spawned and assess the associated command-line arguments to determine if they align with the detection criteria.
  - **Examine Execution Context:** Investigate the process owner's identity and the parent process to understand the context of execution. This can help identify if the execution is legitimate or potentially malicious.
  - **Analyze Network Activity:** Use network logs (from NDR or firewall) to look for unusual external communication patterns initiated by the detected processes or related IP addresses that could indicate data exfiltration.
  - **Check for Known Indicators:** Cross-reference the execution events with threat intelligence sources to see if the identified binaries or their command-line options have been linked to known attacks or adversary TTPs.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity as the execution of renamed PingCastle binaries can indicate unauthorized reconnaissance activities by threat actors, potentially leading to further exploitation of the network environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the binary names and command-line flags have not been altered in a way that evades detection. Additionally, if the binaries are executed from unusual locations or if a legitimate system administrator uses PingCastle for sanctioned security assessments, it may result in false positives. Furthermore, potential blind spots include environments where Sysmon is not deployed or if the command-line logging settings in Windows Security are not configured correctly, which may prevent the necessary telemetry from being captured.

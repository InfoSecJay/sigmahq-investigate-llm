  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of Windows-based hacktools by examining Portable Executable (PE) metadata for the presence of the company name "Cube0x0." These tools, often utilized for malicious activities such as credential theft and lateral movement, can include applications like SharpPrintNightmare, KrbRelay, and SharpMapExec. The focus on PE metadata allows the rule to identify these tools even if their file names have been altered to evade detection. The primary technical data sources integral to this detection involve process creation logs and specific attributes within the PE headers, enabling the identification of these hacktools based on their encoded characteristics. This rule aligns with MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Credential Access (T1588.002) and Credential Dumping (T1003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs for any suspicious process creation events corresponding to binary execution with "Cube0x0" listed in the PE metadata. Validate the context and authentication method used during execution.
  - **Analyze File and Network Behavior:** Utilize EDR tools to track the behavior of the identified processes in real-time. Pay close attention to any outbound network connections that may indicate data exfiltration or additional malicious activity.
  - **Review Historical Execution:** Investigate the history of the identified hacktool execution to determine if it has been executed previously and if there are any known associations with malicious campaigns or threat actors.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference the findings with threat intelligence sources for any reports or indicators of compromise related to the specific tools that exhibit the PE metadata of "Cube0x0." Leverage the information to assess potential impact and necessary remediation actions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a high severity level due to the association with known malicious hacktools that are typically used in sophisticated attacks, including credential theft and lateral movement activities within an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One potential blind spot for this rule involves situations where hacktools may not include "Cube0x0" in their PE metadata, either through modification by an adversary or if using similar tools from different sources. Furthermore, the detection relies on the availability of accurate and complete process creation logs, which can sometimes be missed if log retention policies are not maintained adequately. Lastly, false negatives may occur if a newly developed or customized hacktool does not carry the identifiable metadata attributes.

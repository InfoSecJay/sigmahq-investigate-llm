  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "HackTool 
  - CreateMiniDump Execution" is designed to detect the execution of a specific tool, `CreateMiniDump.exe`, which is often used for illegal credential dumping from the LSASS process in Windows environments. By monitoring process creation events, this rule focuses on identifying instances where this tool is executed, specifically filtering for cases where the image name ends with `CreateMiniDump.exe` and matches a known hash (IMPHASH). This data is primarily sourced from Windows Sysmon logs that capture detailed process creation events. The rule maps to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of **Credential Access** and the technique **T1003.001**, targeting one of the key methods attackers use to extract sensitive information like credentials from the LSASS memory.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Context**: Use EDR tools to review the execution context of the detected process. Check parent-child relationships and user context to understand how and under which account the tool was launched.
    
  - **Analyze Event Logs**: Review Windows Sysmon and Security logs for any related events around the same timestamp. Focus on additional process creations or unusual access patterns that may indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation.
  - **Search for Related Artifacts**: Look for other files or tools commonly associated with the execution of `CreateMiniDump.exe`. This may include the presence of known credential dumping tools or other binaries running in a suspicious manner.
  - **Investigate Network Traffic**: Utilize NDR tools to analyze outbound connections that may coincide with the alert. Specifically, check for any unexpected external communications that could indicate data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as high because the execution of `CreateMiniDump.exe` typically indicates a deliberate attempt to access and extract potentially sensitive credentials, which can lead to further compromises within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule relies on the correct installation and configuration of Sysmon for effective logging of process creations. It may fail to trigger if the tool is renamed or if system protections (such as application whitelisting) are in effect to block its execution. Moreover, attackers may utilize other methods or tools for credential dumping that are not captured by this specific rule, leaving potential gaps in detection capabilities.

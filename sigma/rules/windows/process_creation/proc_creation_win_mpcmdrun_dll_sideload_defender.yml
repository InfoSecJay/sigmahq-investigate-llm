  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potential sideloading of the "mpclient.dll" library via Windows Defender processes, specifically "MpCmdRun.exe" and "NisSrv.exe". The rule analyzes the parent processes associated with these executables, looking for instances where they are executed from non-default directories, which could indicate malicious activity. Key data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs, examining the paths from which "MpCmdRun.exe" and "NisSrv.exe" are launched. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1574.002 (Sideloading) under the Defense Evasion tactic, highlighting how adversaries might exploit legitimate tools to bypass security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Execution Context:** Investigate the process creation logs for "MpCmdRun.exe" and "NisSrv.exe", noting their parent processes and command-line arguments to understand the context of their execution.
  - **Validate Binary Locations:** Examine the file paths of the detected executables to confirm if they originate from a non-default directory, which might indicate an anomaly in the normal operation of Windows Defender.
  - **Cross-Reference Threat Intelligence:** Use threat intelligence feeds to verify if any known malicious activity is associated with the execution of "mpclient.dll" or the observed paths.
  - **Monitor Network Activity:** Utilize EDR tools to assess any network connections made by these processes around the time of their execution to identify potentially malicious communications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity due to the implications of sideloading: it may signify an attempt by an adversary to use a trusted system process to execute malicious code, circumventing traditional security measures.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection may not fire if the malicious executables are run from expected locations or if they utilize alternative methods to load the "mpclient.dll" dynamically. Additionally, if an adversary modifies the file paths or utilizes legitimate processes in unexpected ways without raising sufficient suspicion, the rule may fail to capture those events. It's assumed that typical baseline usage patterns for Windows Defender have been established and adequately monitored.

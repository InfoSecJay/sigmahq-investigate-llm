  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - Nmap/Zenmap Execution" aims to detect the execution of Nmap and Zenmap, both tools commonly used for network discovery and security auditing. Adversaries often use these tools to scan for services running on remote hosts, identifying potential vulnerabilities for exploitation. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs, focusing specifically on instances where the executed image ends with 'nmap.exe' or 'zenmap.exe' and where the original file name matches these criteria. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Discovery (tagged as `attack.discovery`), specifically the technique of Network Service Scanning (T1046). This rule is essential for uncovering potentially malicious reconnaissance efforts in an enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR logs**: Investigate the process creation logs in the EDR to confirm the execution of Nmap or Zenmap, checking the user context to determine if the execution aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.
  - **Review associated network connections**: Use network logging tools to analyze any outbound connections made by Nmap/Zenmap, identifying patterns that may indicate malicious intent, such as scanning for open ports on unauthorized hosts.
  - **Cross-reference with VPN logs**: If the execution occurred from a remote location, check VPN logs to validate the user's access and confirm that their activities were in line with expected behavior.
  - **Analyze other related alerts**: Look for any additional alerts correlated with this event in the SIEM that might indicate broader malicious activity or an initial compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as medium because while Nmap and Zenmap can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, their execution may also signal reconnaissance activities indicative of a malicious actor mapping out the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may fail to detect instances where users rename Nmap or Zenmap executables or use custom scripts to execute these scans. It assumes that logging is adequately configured for process creation and that attackers do not employ sophisticated obfuscation techniques or operate outside standard user contexts. Additionally, legitimate administrative activity may lead to false positives if not properly contextualized.

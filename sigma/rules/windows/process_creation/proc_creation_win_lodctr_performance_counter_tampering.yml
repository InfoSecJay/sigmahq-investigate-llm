title: Rebuild Performance Counter Values Via Lodctr.EXE
id: cc9d3712-6310-4320-b2df-7cb408274d53
status: test
description: Detects the execution of "lodctr.exe" to rebuild the performance counter
  registry values. This can be abused by attackers by providing a malicious config
  file to overwrite performance counter configuration to confuse and evade monitoring
  and security solutions.

  ### Technical Context:
  The detection rule "Rebuild Performance Counter Values Via Lodctr.EXE" focuses on identifying the execution of the `lodctr.exe` process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used to rebuild performance counter registry values. Attackers can misuse this functionality by supplying a malicious configuration file that falsely alters performance counter settings, potentially evading monitoring tools and other security mechanisms. By looking for specific behavior—such as the invocation of `lodctr.exe` with the command-line parameter `-r`—this rule helps to identify potential misuse. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique TA0002 (Execution). The relevant telemetry sources include process creation logs, which capture when and how `lodctr.exe` is executed.
  ### Investigation Steps:
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Check the Windows Security or Sysmon logs for any instances of `lodctr.exe` execution around the time of the alert. Focus on the command-line parameters to confirm if `-r` is present.
    
  - **Analyze Parent Process**: Investigate the parent process of the `lodctr.exe` execution to determine if it originates from a legitimate source or a potentially suspicious application. Look for any abnormal behaviors associated with the parent process.
    
  - **Compare Registry Changes**: After confirming `lodctr.exe` execution, examine the performance counter registry values to identify any unauthorized changes. Use Windows Registry auditing tools or scripts to facilitate this process.
    
  - **Check for Malicious Config Files**: Investigate any configuration files that were supplied alongside `lodctr.exe`, ensuring they are not tampered with or pointing to suspicious paths. Ensure they originate from trusted sources.
  ### Prioritization:
  This alert is marked as medium severity due to its potential to indicate malicious activity, particularly if the execution of `lodctr.exe` disrupts monitoring solutions. Investigations should be prioritized to understand the context and impact of the action taken.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions:
  This rule may not trigger if legitimate administrative activity occurs; therefore, it is essential to differentiate between normal and suspicious usage. Additionally, if an attacker finds a way to obscure their command-line arguments or execute it through a legitimate process, the detection may fail. Adversaries may exploit system misconfigurations or permissions, making it critical for engineers to remain vigilant about environment-specific anomalies.

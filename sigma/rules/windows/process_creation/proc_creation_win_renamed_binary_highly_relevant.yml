  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule identifies potential defense evasion tactics employed by attackers, particularly the renaming of legitimate system binaries to obscure malicious activity. This is often seen in malware operations where known tools such as PsExec, PowerShell, or other administrative utilities are repurposed to execute commands under deceptive contexts. The rule inspects the `OriginalFileName` field from Sysmon logs to spot instances where these well-known binaries (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `mshta.exe`, etc.) are renamed, which is indicative of attempts to evade security controls. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique for this rule is T1036.003, which focuses on renaming and modifying file attributes as a form of defense evasion. By monitoring for these renamed binaries during process creation events, the rule provides insight into potentially malicious behavior within the enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Context**: Utilize EDR tools to inspect the parent-child relationship of processes initiated with the renamed binaries to identify any suspicious activity leading to their execution.
  - **Review Command Line Arguments**: Investigate the command-line parameters associated with the processes to recognize any unusual or potentially malicious commands that may indicate abuse of the renamed binaries.
  - **Correlate Network Activity**: Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to correlate outgoing network connections initiated by the suspicious processes, seeking any signs of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication patterns.
  - **Analyze Historical Logs**: Examine historical Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs for prior occurrences of these binaries being executed under different names to evaluate patterns of potential abuse or compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the implication that an attacker may be attempting to execute malware or utilize tools in a stealthy manner, thereby potentially compromising enterprise security and data integrity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are assumptions in this rule pertaining to the presence of OriginalFileName data; if a legitimate application modifies its binary without preserving this metadata, the rule may not fire. Moreover, custom applications that use renamed binaries could lead to false positives unless accurately whitelisted. Additionally, PsExec installed from the Windows Store does not provide the original filename, which can result in missed detections (false negatives).

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential lateral movement within an enterprise network when an internet-hosted WebDAV share is mounted using the `net.exe` utility. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the executable `net.exe` or its variant `net1.exe` is invoked with command-line arguments that include both the syntax for network share mapping using 'use' and an 'http' prefix, indicating that a WebDAV share is being accessed over the internet. This behavior raises suspicion as it may indicate an adversary attempting to leverage remote resources for unauthorized data access or exfiltration. The detection relies on Windows process creation logs captured by Sysmon and focuses on the `process_creation` category while mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic "Lateral Movement" and the technique "Lateral Tool Transfer" (T1021.002).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Review the Sysmon process creation logs for instances where `net.exe` or `net1.exe` was executed, specifically noting the command-line parameters used during the execution.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Utilize network detection and response (NDR) tools to examine any outbound connections initiated by the host to external IP addresses once the WebDAV share is mounted.
  - **Review Endpoint Activity:** Investigate any user actions associated with the time window of the alert using EDR solutions, looking for any suspicious file accesses or copy operations from the mapped network share.
  - **Correlate with Security Events:** Cross-reference the identified processes and network activity with Windows Security logs to check for any unauthorized access attempts or policy violations regarding remote shares.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential implications of an unauthorized internet-hosted WebDAV share mount, this alert is classified as high severity. It reflects a significant security concern that may allow for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communications, requiring prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `net.exe` or `net1.exe` is legitimate and commonly used for authorized activities. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries might modify their techniques to employ different utilities or custom scripts, which would not be captured by this rule. The detection also relies on Sysmon being properly configured and deployed; therefore, any lapses in logging may lead to incomplete visibility into potentially malicious actions. Lastly, the presence of well-established exception management practices could result in false negatives where malicious actions are disregarded due to past approvals.

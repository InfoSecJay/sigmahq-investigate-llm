  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Remote Access Tool 
  - AnyDesk Piped Password Via CLI" is designed to detect potentially malicious activity associated with the misuse of AnyDesk, a popular remote desktop application. Specifically, the rule captures instances where an attacker may pipe a password directly into an AnyDesk command line instruction using the `--set-password` flag, a method that can enable unauthorized remote access. The rule monitors process creation events, focusing on Windows process logs that include command-line parameters which contain phrases indicative of such an action. The underlying data sources for this detection include the Windows Event Logs, particularly the process creation events logged by Sysmon, which provide detailed information about command-line executions, including the parameters used. This detection is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of Command and Control and the technique T1219.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review the EDR for alerts related to the process creation of AnyDesk and any associated suspicious activities (e.g., unusual user accounts or timings) in proximity to the event.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Examine the command-line parameters of the flagged processes to confirm the use of the `--set-password` flag along with any piping commands (e.g., `echo`).
  - **Inspect User Context:** Determine the user account associated with the process and assess its legitimacy along with any recent account activity to identify possible compromise.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Utilize NDR tools to check for any outbound connections made by the AnyDesk process to identify unusual behavior or communication to unknown IP addresses.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for unauthorized access that can lead to significant security breaches, leveraging compromised credentials or tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One primary assumption is that the telemetry configured properly captures the relevant process creation events; if Sysmon is not deployed, the rule might not trigger. Additionally, legitimate instances of piping commands for AnyDesk may occur, leading to false positives. The rule may also fail to capture instances where attackers utilize different syntax or obscure command patterns, so it is vital to supplement this detection with broader monitoring strategies. Furthermore, failing to monitor for similar applications using the same command structure could result in undetected malicious behaviors.

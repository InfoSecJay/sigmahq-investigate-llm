  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the use of the AnyDesk remote access tool when the password is being set via command-line interface (CLI) piping. Specifically, it looks for command-line executions that include the `--set-password` flag along with the `echo` command fed through the Command Prompt (CMD), indicating that a password is being piped to the AnyDesk application. The detection is based on process creation logs collected from Windows systems, where the rule scans for specific combinations of command-line parameters that suggest potentially unauthorized remote access configuration. By monitoring these parameters, incident responders can identify when unauthorized users may be setting or changing passwords to gain access to remote systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR system to identify instances where AnyDesk was executed with the `--set-password` flag and inspect the associated command-line arguments for potential malicious activity.
  - Analyze user and system logs through the SIEM to determine if there were any prior indications of unauthorized access, including logins from unfamiliar IP addresses or accounts.
  - Investigate network traffic via the NDR to assess whether AnyDesk connections were established following the identified command execution, paying special attention to any anomalous outbound connections.
  - Cross-reference the timestamps of the alerts with proxy logs to identify any unusual or suspicious web activity that may correlate with the detected command-line execution.

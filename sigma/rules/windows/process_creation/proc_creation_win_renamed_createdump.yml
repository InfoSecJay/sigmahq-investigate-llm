  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed CreateDump Utility Execution" detection rule identifies the execution of a renamed legitimate utility, `createdump.exe`, often associated with the LOLOBIN malware. Adversaries frequently use this tool to dump process memory, which can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive information, including passwords and other credential data stored in memory. This rule monitors specific command-line parameters associated with `createdump.exe` execution, particularly the options indicating the program is being instructed to create a dump file (e.g., `-u`, `--full`, and `--name`), while filtering out instances where the original file name doesn't match the expected name for legitimate tool usage. The rule is based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of "Defense Evasion" and techniques T1036 (Masquerading) and T1003.001 (Credential Dumping: Credential Dumping from LSASS).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Execution Context:** Use EDR tools to investigate the execution context of the `createdump.exe`, including the user account, parent process, and timestamp to understand the legitimacy of the action taken.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line parameters of the alerting process instance in Windows Event Logs or through Sysmon logs to verify if the parameters align with typical behavior or patterns of malicious intent.
  - **Assess Process Tree:** Analyze the process tree to identify any suspicious parent-child relationships. Pay attention to whether the `createdump.exe` process was spawned from an unusual or malicious executable.
  - **Correlate with Other Alerts:** Use SIEM to correlate this alert with others concerning credential dumping or known threat actor behaviors, identifying potential intelligence or indicators of compromise related to the output.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the significant risks associated with memory dumping activities, which could lead to credential theft and subsequent compromise of the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger if an adversary renames the `createdump.exe` executable to something benign or less recognizable, as the filtering criteria depend heavily on the expected naming convention. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate applications that use similar command-line flags, requiring careful analysis. Furthermore, if log sources are not available or configured correctly—such as if Sysmon is not deployed or capturing the appropriate events—this rule may fail to fire completely.

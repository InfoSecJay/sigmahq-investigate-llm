  ### Technical Context
  The "PowerShell Base64 Encoded IEX Cmdlet" detection rule is designed to identify instances where a PowerShell command with a Base64-encoded string is executed using the `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) cmdlet. This technique is commonly employed by threat actors to obfuscate malicious commands, making it difficult for traditional security measures to detect their activities. The rule analyzes process creation logs specifically looking for command lines that include variations of the `IEX` cmdlet along with Base64-encoded payloads. Key data sources include Windows process creation event logs which capture details such as command-line arguments, helping to reveal potentially harmful actions being executed within the operating system. The rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of execution, specifically the technique T1059.001, which focuses on the use of command-line interfaces for executing commands.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize your EDR or SIEM tool to filter and examine the process creation logs for instances of PowerShell commands that triggered the alert, particularly focusing on the mentioned command-line patterns.
  - **Analyze Command Structure:** Investigate the command structure to identify whether the Base64-encoded strings are legitimate or indicative of suspicious activity. Decode the Base64 strings if necessary to understand the exact commands being executed.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Employ network detection tools (NDR) to analyze outbound connections initiated by the identified processes, looking for any unusual or unauthorized communication patterns that could indicate exfiltration or further compromise.
  - **Assess User Context:** Inspect user activity logs and authentication events to determine the context of the user that initiated the PowerShell command, identifying whether the command execution aligns with typical user behavior or indicates potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential risk associated with executing Base64-encoded PowerShell commands. Such actions can indicate an active attempt to execute malicious payloads, warranting immediate attention and investigation to mitigate any possible data breaches or system compromises.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if commands are executed through means other than PowerShell or if the Base64 encoding avoids the specific patterns defined in the rule. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks may inadvertently trigger the rule, leading to false positives. It is also assumed that the monitoring of process creation events is properly configured; if logging is incomplete or misconfigured, the rule may fail to detect suspicious activity.

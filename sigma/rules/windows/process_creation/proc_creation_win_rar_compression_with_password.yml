title: Rar Usage with Password and Compression Level
id: faa48cae-6b25-4f00-a094-08947fef582f
status: test
description: Detects the use of rar.exe, on the command line, to create an archive
  with password protection or with a specific compression level. This is pretty indicative
  of malicious actions.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the use of the command-line utility `rar.exe` to create password-protected archives or those utilizing specific compression levels. The rule focuses on identifying command-line arguments that indicate these actions, specifically the presence of the string `-hp`, which signifies password protection, and the strings `-m` or `a`, which relate to compression specifications when creating an archive. When these conditions are met concurrently, it presents a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior, as attackers often employ such techniques to exfiltrate data while obscuring their actions. 
  The data sources involved in this detection include Windows Event Logs capturing process creation events, specifically looking at `CommandLine` parameters. The identified MITRE ATT&CK technique related to this rule is T1560.001, which pertains to the collection of data through archiving, specifically indicating malicious intent when paired with password protection features.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line arguments associated with the detected process creation events in your EDR. Focus on the use of `-hp`, as well as `-m` or `a`, to confirm the context of the command execution.
  - **Correlate with Related Activity:** Use history of Any existing logs (Sysmon, AV, etc.) to correlate this RAR usage with other abnormal activities within the affected host, such as suspicious logins or lateral movement patterns.
  - **Check for Data Exfiltration:** Investigate external network connections and proxy logs to determine if there was any subsequent data exfiltration following the creation of the password-protected archive to ensure that sensitive information isnâ€™t being sent outside the organization.
  - **Interview Relevant Users:** If necessary, consult with end-users associated with the affected system to validate whether the usage of `rar.exe` was legitimate, especially if there are indications of unusual activity aligned with typical business processes.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for data exfiltration and concealing of malicious payloads that can occur with password-protected and specifically compressed archives. Such actions, if conducted without proper justification, are often indicative of serious security incidents requiring immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if legitimate users are frequently using WinRAR with these command-line parameters in a normal business context, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, the rule relies on the visibility of command-line arguments; therefore, if command-line logging is not enabled in the environment, valid malicious activities could go undetected. Moreover, adversaries might employ legitimate non-WinRAR tools that replicate similar functionalities to avoid detection by this specific rule.

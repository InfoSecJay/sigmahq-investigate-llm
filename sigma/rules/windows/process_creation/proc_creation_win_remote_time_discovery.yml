title: Discovery of a System Time
id: b243b280-65fe-48df-ba07-6ddea7646427
status: test
description: Identifies use of various commands to query a systems time. This technique
  may be used before executing a scheduled task or to discover the time zone of a
  target system.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the querying of a system's time through specific command-line utilities in a Windows environment. It identifies the execution of commands such as `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, and `w32tm.exe` when they are used to retrieve time-related information or time zone settings. Querying the system time can be a precursor to executing scheduled tasks or gathering intelligence about the systemâ€™s configuration, which can aid in further malicious activities. The technical data sources utilized in this rule include process creation logs, which capture details about the command-line arguments used and the processes executed.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in your EDR tool to identify instances of `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, or `w32tm.exe` being executed, particularly looking for command-line arguments containing "time" or "tz."
  - Check for any unusual patterns or sequences of commands leading up to the time queries, which may indicate a reconnaissance phase by an unauthorized user or malicious actor.
  - Correlate the timestamps of these events with other security events or alerts to assess if there is any related suspicious activity that necessitates deeper investigation.
  - Explore network activity through your NDR or Proxy logs to identify any outbound connections initiated around the same time as the time-querying commands, which could indicate data exfiltration or communication with malicious external entities.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious Query of MachineGUID" detects the execution of the `reg.exe` command-line tool to query the Machine GUID, which is a unique identifier for the Windows operating system installation. The rule looks for the specific invocation of `reg.exe` that includes the registry path `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography`, the command-line switch `/v`, and the key `MachineGuid`. This type of activity can be indicative of reconnaissance activities where an attacker attempts to glean identification information about the installed systems for later exploitation.
  The detection relies primarily on process creation logs that capture command-line activities for all executed processes. These logs provide critical information about the context in which commands are run, helping to identify potential malicious behavior. The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes this behavior under the tactic of "Discovery" and the technique T1082, which relates to querying system information to facilitate further attacks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Check the process creation logs (Windows Security Logs) for the execution of `reg.exe` with the specified parameters to confirm the alert is associated with legitimate activity or a potential threat.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Investigate the full command-line parameters used in the context of the alert to correlate with user behaviors or system processes, looking for unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Cross-reference the execution time of the suspicious `reg.exe` activity with user activity logs to determine if it aligns with legitimate administrative actions or appears out-of-context.
  - **Utilize EDR for Endpoint Analysis**: Utilize EDR tools to analyze the scoped endpoint for additional context, such as whether the command was executed under a suspicious user account or alongside other known malicious behaviors.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been assigned a low severity level, as querying the Machine GUID alone may not indicate immediate malicious intent. However, it should be investigated as part of a broader reconnaissance activity that may precede an attack.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection may not trigger if `reg.exe` is executed with different arguments or through a different method not captured by the logs. There is an assumption that all invocations of `reg.exe` have been logged appropriately; environments with logging misconfigurations may not capture necessary data. Additionally, sophisticated attackers can use alternate legitimate tools, script executions, or invoke commands in a way designed to evade detection, thereby mitigating the effectiveness of this rule.

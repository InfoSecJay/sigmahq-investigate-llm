  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activities associated with the execution of "hh.exe," a Windows Help file viewer. The rule monitors for instances where "hh.exe" is either invoked to execute or download remotely hosted Compiled HTML Help (.chm) files. Specifically, it looks for process creation events where the command line includes HTTP(S) URLs or UNC paths, which indicate an attempt to remotely access content. The data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs, which provide insights into how and when processes are launched, including their associated command-line arguments. This rule leverages these data points to flag unusual or suspicious usage patterns that could indicate a security incident.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Use the EDR tool to search for instances of "hh.exe" execution within the defined timeframe, focusing on command-line parameters that contain HTTP, HTTPS, or UNC paths.
  - Review the process creation logs for any suspicious activity related to "hh.exe." Pay close attention to the user context in which these processes were executed and look for unusual parent-child relationships.
  - Check network logs from the NGFW or NDR for outbound connections to the URLs identified in the command-line arguments, determining if any data exfiltration or unauthorized access occurred.
  - Utilize AV and Proxy logs to verify whether any of the downloaded .chm files were flagged as malicious or if there were any unusual request patterns indicative of potential exploitation attempts.

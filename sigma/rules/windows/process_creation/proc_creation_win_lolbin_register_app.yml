  ### Technical Context
  The "REGISTER_APP.VBS Proxy Execution" detection rule identifies the execution of a specific Microsoft-signed script, `REGISTER_APP.VBS`, which is used for registering a Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) or Virtual Disk Service (VDS) provider as a COM+ application. This script, when invoked with the `-register` parameter, can potentially be exploited by attackers to execute unauthorized actions, thereby evading defenses. The rule specifically monitors process creation events to capture this behavior, focusing on command-line parameters that include both the script name and the registration flag. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), which discusses how adversaries may use signed binaries (in this case, a signed script) to evade detection mechanisms.
  The relevant technical data sources for this rule primarily include Windows Event Logs, specifically focusing on process creation logs that detail the CommandLine execution parameters of launched processes. Having visibility into these details enables analysts to discern between legitimate and suspicious script executions, particularly in cases where such scripts may be employed as part of an attack vector.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Created:** Utilize your EDR tool to analyze the process creation log for `REGISTER_APP.VBS` to verify the parent process and related execution context. Look for any anomalies indicative of misuse.
    
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters:** Cross-reference the command-line parameters utilized during the script execution, specifically checking for the `-register` flag. Investigate whether the parameters were executed in a context consistent with typical administrative tasks.
  - **Examine Associated Network Activity:** Use the NDR or firewall logs to identify any unusual outbound connections that may be made by the process after execution. This may help in identifying if the script has been leveraged for malicious purposes.
  - **Assess Logins and User Activity:** Investigate correlated Windows Security logs for user logins around the time of the script execution. Ensure the user executing the script has a legitimate reason to register a VSS/VDS provider.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium due to the potential for misuse of the script to perform unauthorized registration of system components. While the script is signed and can have legitimate uses, its execution in unexpected contexts may indicate a compromise and warrants further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the script is executed with modified parameters or if it is invoked under different contexts that do not match the specified command-line conditions. Additionally, the detection may be bypassed if adversaries utilize other signed scripts or techniques that are not covered by this specific monitoring setup. It is also assumed that the organization has baseline knowledge of legitimate uses of the script, making it essential for the SOC to maintain contextual awareness for potential false positives.

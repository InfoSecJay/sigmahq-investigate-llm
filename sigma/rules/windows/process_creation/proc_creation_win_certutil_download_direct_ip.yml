  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious file downloads initiated by the `certutil.exe` executable, which is a legitimate utility in the Windows operating system. By monitoring process creation logs, particularly those associated with `certutil.exe`, the rule identifies command line arguments that allow the tool to download files directly from internet resources. Specifically, it flags instances where the command line is used with specific parameters (`urlcache`, `verifyctl`) and contains direct IP addresses disguised within standard URL formatting (e.g., `://1`, `://2`, etc.). This activity can indicate an attempt to bypass security mechanisms or direct downloads from potentially malicious sources, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (T1027).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Event Details:** Review the endpoint's EDR for the `certutil.exe` process creation event. Confirm the command line arguments used, and note any suspicious patterns or additional processes spawned as a result of the command.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Use Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to track outbound connections made by the system running `certutil.exe`. Look for connections to unfamiliar or flagged IP addresses that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.
  - **Examine File System Changes:** Inspect the file system for any files downloaded during the execution of `certutil.exe`. Verify the integrity and legitimacy of these files using threat intelligence databases.
  - **Review Proxy and VPN Logs:** Analyze logs from proxy servers and VPN gateways to see if there is any record of the endpoint connecting to suspicious URLs or IPs. This can provide additional context on the potential source of the download.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the inherent risk associated with downloads executed through `certutil.exe`, particularly when they are from direct IP addresses. Such activities can be indicative of malicious behaviors, including threat actor exploits or data exfiltration attempts, necessitating prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the file download is executed through alternative methods or tools rather than `certutil.exe`. Additionally, if the adversary uses local IP ranges, they may evade detection, underscoring the need for environment-specific configurations. Adversaries may also employ obfuscation techniques not covered by the established command-line patterns, leading to missed detections.

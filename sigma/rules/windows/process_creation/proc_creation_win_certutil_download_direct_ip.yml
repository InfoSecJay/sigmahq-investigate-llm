  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify suspicious file downloads initiated by the Windows utility `certutil.exe` using direct IP addresses. Specifically, it looks for process creation logs where `certutil.exe` is executed with command-line flags that indicate the downloading of files from URLs (e.g., `urlcache` and `verifyctl`) that contain direct IP addresses (e.g., `://1`, `://2`, etc.). The significance of detecting such usage is rooted in the fact that `certutil.exe` can be misused by attackers to download malicious files without the need for domain name resolution, which can help evade security measures and monitoring tools. The rule is applicable to Windows systems and utilizes data sources primarily from process creation logs.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Use EDR tools to review the execution history of `certutil.exe` by investigating the process creation logs for the event that triggered the detection.
  - Examine the command-line arguments associated with the detected execution to determine the IP address from which the file was downloaded and the nature of the downloaded file.
  - Correlate findings with firewall logs from the NGFW to identify any outbound connections made to the direct IP address at the time of the download, looking for additional suspicious activity.
  - Review the affected hostâ€™s network activity through Proxy and VPN logs to identify any subsequent communication with the IP address or domains related to the downloaded file.

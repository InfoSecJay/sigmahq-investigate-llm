  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled **"Potential Product Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE"** focuses on detecting the use of the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility to query the system for installed software, specifically targeting firewall and antivirus products. WMIC is a powerful command-line interface that allows users to perform a range of system management tasks, including the enumeration of installed applications. This rule leverages Windows process creation logs to identify instances of `wmic.exe` running with command-line parameters that indicate an intent to list products. The detection is formulated to look for the combination of the process image name ending in `wmic.exe` and the command line containing the keyword "Product." This activity falls under the **MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Execution** and Technique: **T1047 
  - Windows Management Instrumentation**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the process creation log for instances of `wmic.exe` execution, specifically looking for the associated user account and timestamp of the activity.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Investigate related logs such as Windows Firewall logs and antivirus logs to determine if there were any other concerning events or anomalies that accompany the WMIC execution.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze the exact command-line arguments used during WMIC execution to ascertain what queries were performed, focusing on how the reconnaissance was conducted.
  - **Check for Unusual User Accounts:** Look into the user accounts that initiated the WMIC command, particularly checking for any unusual or unauthorized accounts that may have carried out this action.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium as the detection indicates potential reconnaissance activity that could precede further malicious actions, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in installed security products.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if WMIC is executed using alternate methods, such as scripts that obscure command-line arguments or via tools that mask process creation events. It assumes that logging for process creation is enabled across all endpoints and that the logs are properly aggregated in the SIEM. Furthermore, this rule may not capture legitimate administrative uses of WMIC, so context around the userâ€™s role and normal activities must be understood.

title: SQL Client Tools PowerShell Session Detection
id: a746c9b8-a2fb-4ee5-a428-92bee9e99060
status: test
description: |
  This rule detects execution of a PowerShell code through the sqltoolsps.exe utility, which is included in the standard set of utilities supplied with the Microsoft SQL Server Management studio.
  Script blocks are not logged in this case, so this utility helps to bypass protection mechanisms based on the analysis of these logs.

  ### Technical Context
  The SQL Client Tools PowerShell Session Detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious executions of PowerShell commands that are invoked through `sqltoolsps.exe`, a utility shipped with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This tool may be utilized by attackers to execute commands directly, without generating typical PowerShell log entries, thereby circumventing enterprise monitoring efforts. The detection leverages process creation logs to identify instances where `sqltoolsps.exe` is launched, specifically monitoring scenarios where its parent process is `smss.exe`, indicating potential misuse in an attempt to evade detection mechanisms. This rule specifically relates to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, particularly the "Execution" tactic (T1059.001) and "Defense Evasion" tactic (T1127).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Process Chain:** Investigate the parent-child process relationships using EDR tools to determine if `sqltoolsps.exe` was legitimately invoked or part of suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Check the command-line parameters of the detected execution to identify any unusual or uncommon PowerShell commands being executed through `sqltoolsps.exe`.
  - **Review Logs from Security Tools:** Examine the Windows Security and Sysmon logs for any additional indicators of compromise related to PowerShell execution or unusual file access patterns around SQL Server Management Studio.
  - **Assess User Context:** Identify the user account that executed `sqltoolsps.exe`, utilizing logs from user activity monitoring to correlate this account to any known malicious behavior or insider threats.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as medium severity due to the dual nature of the executed processes, which can signify both legitimate administrative tasks and potentially malicious activities attempting to exploit PowerShell's capabilities without raising alarms through common logging mechanisms. Prompt investigation is essential to ascertain the intent behind the execution.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary uses other legitimate tools or obfuscates their commands further, or if PowerShell logging is correctly configured and engaged. It assumes the presence of `sqltoolsps.exe` and that the attacker's behavior aligns with common execution patterns, which may not always be the case if novel techniques are employed. Additionally, environments with alternative logging mechanisms might overlook instances entirely, indicating a need for tight integration of various log sources to enhance detection capabilities.

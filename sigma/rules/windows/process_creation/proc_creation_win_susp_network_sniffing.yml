title: Potential Network Sniffing Activity Using Network Tools
id: ba1f7802-adc7-48b4-9ecb-81e227fddfd5
status: test
description: |
  Detects potential network sniffing via use of network tools such as "tshark", "windump".
  Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.
  An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting potential network sniffing activity focuses on identifying the use of network analysis tools, specifically `tshark.exe` and `windump.exe`, which are commonly used to capture and analyze network traffic. This type of activity can indicate an adversary attempting to monitor sensitive data in transit by placing a network interface into promiscuous mode, allowing them to collect data packets that are not necessarily intended for their system. The rule primarily relies on process creation logs, examining command-line parameters to identify specific flags—such as `-i` with `tshark`—that indicate an intent to capture traffic. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1040, which addresses exfiltration and credential access through network sniffing tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows Security Event Logs for entries related to `tshark.exe` or `windump.exe` process creations, paying close attention to the CommandLine field for suspicious parameters.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize Network Detection and Response (NDR) tools to investigate if any unusual traffic patterns were detected during the time frame of the alert, particularly looking for unexpected data exfiltration or traffic to external entities.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Look into user activity logs in your SIEM to determine if the user account associated with the alert has legitimate administrative roles or if this activity is uncharacteristic based on their operational profile.
  - **Monitor System Integrity:** Use EDR and System logs (Sysmon) to confirm if the network interfaces were set to promiscuous mode and examine any relevant changes made to network configurations or driver loads.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for an adversary to intercept sensitive information through network sniffing, this alert is considered medium severity in an enterprise environment. Although the activity could stem from legitimate administrative functions, the risk of data exfiltration makes it crucial to investigate promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is important to recognize that the rule may not trigger if the tools were launched with benign command-line arguments not captured in the detection logic or if `tshark` and `windump` are obfuscated (renamed or embedded within other applications). Additionally, network sniffing can occur with other, less commonly used tools that may not be included in this rule. The accuracy of the alerts also hinges on the proper logging of process creation events; any environmental configuration that omits this logging may lead to oversight.

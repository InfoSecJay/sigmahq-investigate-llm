title: Local Groups Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE
id: 164eda96-11b2-430b-85ff-6a265c15bf32
status: test
description: |
  Detects the execution of "wmic" with the "group" flag.
  Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
  Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Local Groups Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE" is designed to identify potential reconnaissance activities performed by adversaries using the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool. Specifically, this rule monitors for the execution of "wmic.exe" with command-line parameters that include the "group" flag, which is typically used to query information about local system groups and their memberships. By obtaining intelligence about local groups, attackers can assess which users have elevated privileges, such as members of the local administrators group. The rule leverages the "process creation" log source, focusing on the execution of wmic.exe, along with tracking command-line arguments to identify potentially malicious activities. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of discovery and the technique T1069.001, which specifically addresses reconnaissance of local group memberships.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Check the process creation logs in the EDR for any instances of "wmic.exe" execution, paying particular attention to command-line arguments that include "group."
    
  - **Correlate with User Accounts**: Investigate the user account that executed the wmic command to determine if it has valid administrative credentials or if it falls within typical user activity patterns.
  - **Analyze Network Activity**: Use network detection tools to check for any unusual outbound connections following the execution of the wmic command that may indicate data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - **Examine Audit Logs**: Consult Windows Security event logs for any related authentication or privilege escalation events around the same time as the wmic.exe execution to further understand the context of the command.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as low severity, as not all usage of wmic.exe indicates malicious intent. However, it requires investigation due to its potential association with reconnaissance operations aimed at identifying users with elevated permissions.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several factors that may lead to the Sigma rule not firing or being less effective in certain environments. For instance, if an adversary executes wmic.exe with different parameters or makes use of alternative enumeration techniques, this rule will not trigger. Additionally, legitimate administrative tasks may also result in the execution of wmic with the group flag. Furthermore, if logging is not sufficiently configured on endpoints, the rule might not capture relevant events, thus limiting visibility.

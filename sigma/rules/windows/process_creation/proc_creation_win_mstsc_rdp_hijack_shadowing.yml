  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential MSTSC Shadowing Activity" detects instances of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session hijacking through the use of the Microsoft Terminal Services Client (MSTSC) shadowing feature. Specifically, the rule looks for command-line parameters that indicate the execution of a shadowing command without user consent, as signified by the presence of `noconsentprompt` and `shadow:` in the command line. The relevant technical data sources for this detection include process creation logs that capture detailed information about the invocation of processes, including command-line parameters and the context in which they were executed. This activity corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK technique for lateral movement (T1563.002) and involves unauthorized access to user sessions, posing a significant risk to sensitive data and operational integrity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review EDR alerts for any abnormal process behaviors associated with MSTSC or RDP sessions during the timeframe of the alert. Look for parent-child relationships in process trees that may indicate shadowing activity.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Analyze the Windows Security logs for login events that coincide with the detected MSTSC shadowing activity. Pay particular attention to any failed login attempts or suspicious user logins.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Use Sysmon logs to investigate the full command-line parameters of the executed MSTSC processes. Validate the presence of `noconsentprompt` and ensure they were initiated by legitimate users.
  - **Consult Session Logs:** If applicable, check RDP session logs to identify any legitimate user connections that were shadowed. Cross-reference this with any alerts generated for unauthorized access attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential impact of unauthorized session hijacking, which can lead to data breaches or facilitate further lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the MSTSC shadowing command is obfuscated or executed with altered parameters that do not include `noconsentprompt` or `shadow:`. Additionally, it relies on the visibility of process creation events; if logging is misconfigured or lacks sufficient detail, the rule may fail to detect actual instances. It is also assumed that the environment uses default RDP settings, and customized configurations may lead to missed detections.

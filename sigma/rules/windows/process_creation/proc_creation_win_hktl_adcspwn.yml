  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - ADCSPwn Execution" is designed to detect potentially malicious usage of the ADCSPwn tool, which is known for exploiting vulnerabilities in Active Directory environments. Specifically, the rule identifies command-line parameters associated with its execution, particularly those that indicate attempts to escalate privileges using machine account authentication and relaying to the certificate service. The detection is based on monitoring process creation events from Windows, focusing on specific command line arguments that have been identified as indicative of the toolâ€™s operation. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics involved here include "Credential Access" (T1557.001), which highlights the importance of monitoring for tools that can compromise credentials.
  Insider threats and external attackers may utilize ADCSPwn in attempts to gain unauthorized access to privileged accounts within the network. By analyzing process creation logs, security teams can uncover the misuse of this tool and respond effectively to potential security incidents.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Check the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution for alerts related to process creations that include the specified command-line arguments (`--adcs` and `--port`). Investigate the context of these alerts and look for signs of unusual behavior from the originating host.
  - **Correlate with Event Logs**: Use Windows Event Logs to gather detailed information on the processes associated with the detected command-line usage. Pay special attention to the PID, parent process, and user context under which the process is running.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Examine network connection logs to see if there are any outbound connections that align with the timing of the ADCSPwn execution, especially connections to certificate services or domain controllers.
  - **Check for Associated Techniques**: Look for other telemetry that may correlate with known tactics used by ADCSPwn, such as abnormal DNS queries, file accesses related to known credential files, or suspicious PowerShell invocation patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for significant harm posed by unauthorized privilege escalation tools within an Active Directory environment. Prompt investigation is critical to mitigate risks associated with potential credential breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in instances where ADCSPwn is executed with obfuscated command-line parameters or if it is embedded within other legitimate processes that do not follow typical execution patterns. Additionally, the alert will not trigger if the system does not log process creation events or if logging configurations are not adequately set to capture relevant command-line data. Adversaries may also deploy similar techniques from custom-built or modified tools, evading detection by not using the specific identifiers that this rule monitors.

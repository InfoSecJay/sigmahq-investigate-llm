  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Gpresult Display Group Policy Information" is designed to detect instances where a user invokes the built-in Windows utility `gpresult.exe` to display the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) information. This utility retrieves data about applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and can be used by both legitimate users and potential malicious actors. The rule specifically looks for process creation events indicating that `gpresult.exe` has been executed with command-line arguments such as `/z` or `/v`, which request verbose outputs. By focusing on these command-line flags, the rule aims to capture administrative queries that may indicate either legitimate troubleshooting or possible reconnaissance activities in support of further malicious actions. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Discovery" under technique T1615, which covers threats that exploit administrative tools to gather system information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to examine process creation logs for occurrences of `gpresult.exe` being executed, along with the specific command-line parameters that triggered the alert.
  - **Analyze User Activity:** Check Windows Security Event Logs to identify the user associated with the execution of `gpresult.exe`, including any historical login and privilege levels to establish context around their activity.
  - **Correlate with Group Policy Changes:** Investigate Group Policy changes or configurations by checking the Event Viewer under the Group Policy operational log within the System category to determine if this command execution was justified or if there were any unauthorized attempts.
  - **Monitor for Subsequent Actions:** Keep an eye on subsequent process creation events or network connections to determine if the execution of this command was followed by further suspicious activity, indicating potential exploitation or data exfiltration.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because while the execution of `gpresult.exe` can be part of legitimate administrative activities, it also poses a risk when used by malicious actors for reconnaissance purposes. Immediate investigation is warranted to rule out any nefarious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the utility is executed without the specified command-line options or if it is invoked through other processes that do not involve direct user action. Additionally, the effectiveness of detection relies on the presence and proper configuration of Windows Security and Sysmon log sources. Adversaries may also employ obfuscation tactics or alter command-line parameters to evade detection, potentially leading to false negatives.

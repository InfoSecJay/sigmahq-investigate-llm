  7Zip or Winrar, which is a sign of phishing as threat actors put small ISO files
  in archives as email attachments to bypass certain filters and protective measures

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activity associated with the extraction and opening of ISO files using common archiving tools such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, and PeaZip. By monitoring process creation events, the rule flags instances where one of these archiving applications is used to open an ISO file, which is often a tactic employed by threat actors to deliver malware via email attachments. The detection focuses specifically on the "initial access" tactic under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly technique T1566 (Phishing), indicating that the behavior can be related to phishing attempts. Data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, which contain valuable information about executable file actions, including their parent processes and image paths.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Details:** Review the process details in your EDR solution for the process ID related to the alert to determine the user context and other related processes that might have occurred simultaneously.
  - **Examine Windows Event Logs:** Query the Windows Security event logs to assess any prior authentication events from the user and look for suspicious activity or unusual patterns surrounding the process creation.
  - **Review Proxy Logs:** Analyze the proxy logs to identify any related web requests made by the user leading up to the incident, particularly those that may have been initiated from external email services.
  - **Investigate Email Headers:** Collect and analyze the headers of incoming emails to which the detected activity is potentially linked, looking for indications of phishing, such as suspicious sender domains or misleading subject lines.
  ### Prioritization
  Due to the high potential for ISO files to hide malicious payloads, the alert generated from this rule indicates a high severity level. Any instance of executable file actions associated with archivers and ISO images warrants immediate investigation to prevent potential initial access by threat actors.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where legitimate users are opening ISO files that are included in archives, resulting in false negatives if behavior is typical and predictable within the organization. Additionally, the rule relies on the presence of Windows event logging configured correctly to capture all necessary process creation events. Adversaries may also evade detection by using less common archiving tools or file types unsupported by this rule, rendering it less effective against more sophisticated techniques that do not utilize known patterns.

title: Changing Existing Service ImagePath Value Via Reg.EXE
id: 9b0b7ac3-6223-47aa-a3fd-e8f211e637db
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services.
  Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for registry to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code at Service start.
  Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential malicious activities where adversaries modify the `ImagePath` value of existing Windows services using the `reg.exe` command-line tool. By changing the registry entry located at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`, attackers can redirect service execution to a malicious executable of their choosing, thereby enabling persistent unauthorized access. The rule specifically searches for command-line invocations of `reg.exe` that involve adding registry entries under the targeted service path with an emphasis on modifications to the `ImagePath`. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic is **Persistence**, specifically technique **T1574.011** (Service Image Path Modification). 
  Data sources involved include Windows Security event logs capturing process creation details, particularly the command-line parameters of each process execution. This information is essential for identifying unauthorized use of registry modifications that directly impact service behavior.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Access EDR Logs**: Check the EDR logs to identify the host from which the alert was triggered, focusing on the process creation logs during the time frame of the event.
  - **Validate Command Line**: Analyze the command-line parameters used in the `reg.exe` process for unusual entries that reference the `ImagePath` modification to determine the specific service affected.
  - **Inspect Service Settings**: Use the Windows Services console or PowerShell to confirm the current `ImagePath` configuration for the identified service, comparing it to the expected configuration.
  - **Review Audit Logs**: Consult the Security event logs to assess if there are any additional suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts around the time of the registry modification.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to its potential to enable persistence mechanisms by altering system service configurations. Immediate investigation is necessary to determine if this behavior is legitimate or indicative of a compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if the `reg.exe` command is executed without the specified parameters or if registry auditing is not adequately configured on the monitored systems. Additionally, skilled adversaries could utilize alternative methods to alter service images without invoking `reg.exe`, thus bypassing detection. There's an assumption that standard logging is enabled at the time of the incident; if logging is disabled or incomplete, relevant activity may go unnoticed.

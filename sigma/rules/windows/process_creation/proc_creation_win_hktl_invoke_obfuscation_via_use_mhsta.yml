  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Invoke-Obfuscation Via Use MSHTA" is designed to detect the use of Microsoft HTML Application (MSHTA) as a vector for invoking obfuscated PowerShell scripts. This technique is often employed by adversaries to bypass traditional security measures due to its capability to execute scripts indirectly through command-line arguments that include obfuscated commands. The rule leverages process creation logs to identify when the command-line parameters of a new process include specific strings associated with this evasion method, such as 'set', '&&', 'mshta', 'vbscript:createobject', '.run', and '(window.close)'. By monitoring for these keywords, security teams can pinpoint potentially malicious activity that seeks to obfuscate execution logic, making it a critical detection point in threat hunting and incident response.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the EDR solution for any process creation events related to MSHTA, particularly focusing on those that match the command-line patterns configured in this rule.
  - Check command-line arguments and parent processes of any identified MSHTA invocations to determine the origin and intent of the script being executed.
  - Analyze network activity originating from the affected hosts using NDR tools to identify any suspicious external communications or data exfiltration attempts associated with the detected activity.
  - Utilize SIEM to correlate alerts with other security events and logs from AV and NGFW, looking for patterns consistent with known attack methodologies and indicators of compromise.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potential User Account Control (UAC) bypass attempts through the use of Event Viewer’s RecentViews functionality. UAC bypasses are techniques whereby an attacker can run a process with escalated privileges without user consent or awareness. The rule relies on examining `process_creation` logs, specifically focusing on command lines that reference Event Viewer’s RecentViews directory. By looking for command-line arguments that contain paths to this directory, as well as redirection operators, the rule flags potentially malicious activities that conform to the pattern of UAC bypassing. This behavior falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Defense Evasion (T1203) and Privilege Escalation (T1068), highlighting the significance of this technique in both evading detection and gaining elevated permissions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use the EDR to analyze process creation logs for any instances of `eventvwr.exe` being launched with command lines containing `\Event Viewer\RecentViews`, indicating potential UAC bypass attempts.
  - **Correlate with User Activities:** Cross-check the timestamps and user accounts associated with the flagged events against user activity logs in case the command was executed as part of legitimate operations or maintenance.
  - **Examine Execution Context:** Investigate the context in which the command to Event Viewer was executed, looking for any preceding processes that initiated privilege escalation maneuvers or indicated malicious intent.
  - **Monitor for Related Network Traffic:** Utilize network detection tools to determine if there were any suspicious outbound connections or communications following the execution of the identified process, which often accompanies successful exploitation.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that UAC bypass techniques are critical for escalating privileges without user consent, this alert is classified as high severity. Organizations must treat such alerts with urgency as they can indicate a serious security breach with potential unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger in scenarios where an attacker employs obfuscation techniques in the command line or utilizes alternative methods for privilege escalation that do not explicitly reference Event Viewer’s RecentViews. Additionally, if legitimate administrative accounts utilize the Event Viewer functionality frequently, this may lead to potential false positives. Security teams should also take into account the possibility of an adversary completely bypassing the detection by using non-standard paths or misconfiguring their tactics to avoid recognized command patterns.

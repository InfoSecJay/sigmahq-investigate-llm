  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential attempts by threat actors, specifically Threat Group 3390 (Bronze Union), to disable HTTP logging on Windows IIS web servers, which is a tactic used to evade detection. The rule focuses on identifying the use of the `appcmd.exe` process to manipulate IIS configurations, specifically looking for a command line that sets the HTTP logging configuration to not log requests (i.e., `dontLog:true`). This action hinders an organization's ability to monitor and audit web traffic, thus facilitating malicious activities. The rule integrates data from Windows process creation logs, particularly those related to the execution of the `appcmd.exe` process, enabling monitoring for this specific command line pattern. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically the technique T1562.002, which is aimed at altering or disabling logging mechanisms.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Logs:** Review Windows Event Logs for process creation events related to `appcmd.exe` to confirm the execution and capture details such as timestamps and user accounts.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Usage:** Examine the command-line arguments associated with the detected process, specifically looking for any instance of `set config section:httplogging dontLog:true` which indicates a direct attempt to disable logging.
  - **Audit IIS Configuration:** Access the IIS Manager or perform a `Get-WebConfiguration` command via PowerShell to verify the current logging settings for HTTP requests and determine if they reflect the changes detected by the rule.
  - **Investigate User Accounts:** Identify the user account that executed the command. Check for unusual logins or previous compromise indicators that might suggest malicious intent or insider threats.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity because disabling HTTP logging can significantly degrade an organization's ability to detect and respond to web-based attacks, allowing adversaries to operate with greater stealth.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `appcmd.exe` executable is renamed or if the command to disable logging is executed through other means (for instance, directly manipulating IIS configuration files or using different management tools). It is assumed that IIS logs are enabled in the first place and that no other configurations override logging settings without routing through `appcmd.exe`. Adversaries may also use techniques to clear logs or revert changes after executing commands, which could obscure detection.

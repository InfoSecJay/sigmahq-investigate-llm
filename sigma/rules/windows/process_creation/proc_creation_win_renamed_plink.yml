  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Renamed Plink Execution" is designed to detect potential misuse of the Plink binary by monitoring for renamed versions of it executing on Windows systems. Plink, a command-line interface to the PuTTY back-end, is commonly used in SSH connections and remote access scenarios, which makes it a target for adversaries looking to establish unauthorized access. This rule specifically looks for process creation logs where the `OriginalFileName` is 'Plink' and the command line arguments include suspicious networking flags such as `-l forward`, `-P`, or `-R`, which are typically associated with port forwarding or reverse shell activities. To minimize false positives, the detection includes a filter that ensures the process executing is genuinely Plink by verifying that it ends with ‘\plink.exe’. This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for Defense Evasion (TA0005) and specifically the technique of Masquerading (T1036).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the process creation events in the EDR tool to gather details on the executed process, such as the parent process ID, user context, and timestamp.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Use the command line parameters captured in the logs to determine the intent of the execution, especially looking for unusual combinations that suggest nefarious intentions.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Investigate related network connections in the NDR tool that may correspond with the time of the Plink execution, especially looking for external connections which may indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
  - **Review Incident History:** Look into historical logs for similar alert patterns or known occurrences of malicious Plink usage to assess if this is part of a broader threat campaign or isolated incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity is categorized as high due to the potential of Plink being used as a tool for unauthorized access or data exfiltration, both of which pose significant risks to enterprise security.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the actual Plink binary retains its name but operates in a benign context; for example, legitimate users may also execute Plink for authorized tasks. Additionally, if an adversary modifies the original binary or utilizes a different executable masquerading as Plink, the detection may fail. It's also assumed that monitoring for process creation events and command-line parameters is active; if such telemetry is not captured, the detection rule will not trigger.

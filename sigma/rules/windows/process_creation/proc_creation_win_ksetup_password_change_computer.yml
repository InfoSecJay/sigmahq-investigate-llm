  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Computer Password Change Via Ksetup.EXE" is designed to detect unauthorized or suspicious changes to the computer's domain account or host principal password using the `ksetup.exe` utility. This executable is part of Windows' support for Kerberos authentication, specifically related to configuring and managing domain and host principal settings. The detection occurs by monitoring the process creation logs for instances of `ksetup.exe`, particularly focusing on the command line parameters. When the command line includes the `/setcomputerpassword` switch, it indicates a potentially critical action where the computer's password is being changed, which can be exploited by an attacker to maintain access or conduct lateral movement within an organization.
  This rule directly relates to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution, specifically under the technique of "Command-Line Interface" (T1059). By recognizing the execution of `ksetup.exe` with this particular command line, the SOC can identify possible credential manipulation or malicious activities aimed at compromising the integrity of system accounts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin**: Check the process creation logs in your EDR tool to ascertain the legitimacy of the `ksetup.exe` process by examining its file path and parent process ID (PID).
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Review the command line parameters used with `ksetup.exe`, specifically looking for the `/setcomputerpassword` switch to confirm if the action was authorized.
  - **Correlate with Domain Controller Logs**: Investigate domain controller logs to determine if the password change corresponds with legitimate administrative activities or if it appears anomalous.
  - **Review User Context**: Identify the user account which initiated the process. Verify if this account has the necessary permissions to change computer accounts within the domain.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is set to medium due to the potential impact of unauthorized password changes on system security. This activity can indicate compromised accounts or may be part of a larger strategy to establish persistence on the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `ksetup.exe` is not commonly used for legitimate password changes, or if it is executed in a non-standard way that doesn't match the specified command line patterns. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes other methods or tools to change passwords without invoking `ksetup.exe`, these activities may go undetected. It's also assumed that logging is enabled and correctly configured for process creations, which might not be the case in all environments.

  An adversary might use WMI to discover information about the system, such as the volume name, size,
  free space, and other disk information. This can be done using the `wmic` command-line utility and has been
  observed being used by threat actors such as Volt Typhoon.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "System Disk And Volume Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE" identifies potential reconnaissance activities conducted by an adversary using the `wmic` command-line utility. The rule targets specific indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to the `wmic` command, particularly when it is employed to gather information about disk volumes, including names, sizes, and free space. The key technical data sources utilized for this detection involve process creation logs, with a focus on the execution of `WMIC.exe`. By analyzing the command-line parameters for evidence of reconnaissance activities related to volume and disk information, this detection rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation) and T1082 (System Information Discovery). This activity is commonly associated with threat actors aiming to gather intelligence about the target environment prior to launching further attacks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs for any instances of `WMIC.exe` that match the identified command line patterns, paying particular attention to command-line arguments that include 'volume' or 'path win32_logicaldisk'.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Validate findings by cross-referencing logs from the EDR system for suspicious processes running concurrently or immediately before the `wmic` execution to provide context on the incident.
  - **Assess User Behavior:** Check the user account invoking `WMIC.exe` in the Security Event Logs to determine whether the account displays any anomalous behavior or is expected to run such commands.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** If applicable, analyze network traffic logs to see if there is any unusual outbound access or communications following the reconnaissance activity to assess potential follow-up actions by the adversary.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been designated as medium severity as the use of `WMIC.exe` for system reconnaissance indicates that an adversary is actively probing the environment for further exploits, which could lead to significant breaches if combined with other malicious actions.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the `wmic` command is executed in a legitimate context by authorized personnel, potentially leading to false negatives. Additionally, if an attacker uses obfuscated commands or modified executables that do not match the hardcoded indicators, the detection may fail. It is assumed that the environments being monitored have not disabled Sysmon logging for process creation, as this would inhibit visibility into the command's execution.

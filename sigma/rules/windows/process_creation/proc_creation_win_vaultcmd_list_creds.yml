  ### Technical Context
  The rule is designed to detect unauthorized access to stored credentials in the Windows Credential Manager by monitoring the use of the `vaultcmd.exe` utility. Credential Manager is a secure repository for storing various types of credentials, making it a target for attackers seeking to compromise user accounts or gain further access within an enterprise environment. This rule focuses on process creation events, specifically looking for instances where `vaultcmd.exe` is executed with the command-line argument `/listcreds:`. By analyzing process creation logs, the rule identifies potential credential theft attempts while specifically correlating the behavior to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1555.004 (Credentials from Password Managers).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the EDR logs for any occurrences of `VaultCmd.exe` being launched with the `/listcreds:` parameter, including timestamps and associated user accounts.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Investigate the user's recent activities in Windows Event Logs (Security), particularly around the time of the `vaultcmd.exe` execution, to determine if any suspicious behavior is present.
  - **Review Credential Access Logs:** Analyze Azure Active Directory or local Security/Event logs for any actions taken by the user leading up to or following the credential listing, as this may indicate further malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize network traffic logs to see if any data exfiltration attempts were made post-execution, particularly focusing on outgoing connections to known malicious IPs or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level because accessing Windows Credential Manager could indicate potential credential theft or abuse but may also be a legitimate action, depending on the context of the user's role and activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the malicious actor uses alternative tools or scripts to access credentials without invoking `vaultcmd.exe`. Furthermore, it assumes that appropriate settings enable logging for process creation events, and it may not detect incidents if logs are deleted or otherwise obfuscated by an adversary. Additionally, scenarios where users legitimately access their credentials as part of routine work may result in false positives.

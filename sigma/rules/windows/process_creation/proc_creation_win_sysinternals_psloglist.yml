  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the suspicious use of the `PsLogList` utility, which is part of the Sysinternals suite of tools. Adversaries can utilize this tool to dump event logs from a Windows system, potentially to extract sensitive information about administrator accounts for account discovery or to delete logs that could reveal their activities. The rule leverages process creation logs, specifically monitoring for instances of `PsLogList` being executed with indicative command-line parameters such as `-d` for dumping logs, `-x` for exporting logs, and the use of specific log type arguments (security, application, system). By correlating these parameters against the expected behavior of `PsLogList`, this rule helps identify potentially malicious activities in line with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1087 (Account Discovery), T1087.001 (Account Discovery via Command-Line Interface), and T1087.002 (Account Discovery via Remote Services).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:**
    Review the process creation logs in your EDR or SIEM to identify when `PsLogList` was executed. Correlate the timestamps with other suspicious activities around the same time.
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters:**
    Inspect the command-line arguments used with `PsLogList` in the logs. Pay particular attention to the presence of flags indicating log dumping or deletion, which can signify malicious intent.
  - **Analyze Event Logs:**
    Investigate the corresponding event logs (Security, Application, System) for any anomalies or tampering that may indicate an attempt to conceal unauthorized access or activity by the user or process in question.
  - **Cross-reference User Activity:**
    Examine user access logs to ascertain whether the account executing `PsLogList` has a history of administrative activities or if this is an anomalous behavior for that user.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule generates medium-severity alerts because while the use of `PsLogList` can be legitimate in certain administrative contexts, its suspicious use cases raise the potential for serious security incidents related to account discovery and log tampering.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in scenarios where adversaries use alternate tools that are capable of executing similar functions without triggering this specific rule, or if they modify the command-line parameters to evade detection. Additionally, the rule may not account for legitimate administrative actions where `PsLogList` is used appropriately, which may lead to false positives. Understanding that different environments may have varying policies around tool usage is essential for effective application of this rule.

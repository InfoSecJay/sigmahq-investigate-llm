  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the client32.exe executable, associated with the NetSupport Remote Access Tool (RAT), from locations outside of the typical installation directories, namely 'C:\Program Files' and 'C:\Program Files (x86)'. The rule leverages Windows process creation logs to identify instances where this specific executable is run, while filtering out legitimate instances operating within standard directories. By focusing on execution from unusual paths, the rule aims to highlight potentially malicious use of the NetSupport RAT, which could indicate an attacker trying to bypass defenses. This detection is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of defense evasion, specifically related to techniques that involve executing malicious tools from atypical file locations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Source:** Utilize EDR tools to verify the source of the client32.exe execution, examining the file path from which it was launched to determine if it's atypical and potentially malicious.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line arguments of the client32.exe process within the EDR to understand the context of its execution and identify any harmful activity or unusual parameters.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Analyze network logs to check for any unusual outbound connections made by the client32.exe process, focusing on IPs and domains to ascertain if data exfiltration attempts are occurring.
  - **Assess User Context:** Investigate the user account that initiated the execution of client32.exe, checking for any anomalies such as unusual access patterns or whether the user typically operates in a privileged context.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a medium severity level due to the potential risk of unauthorized access through remote tools, which could lead to data breaches or network compromises if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire if the NetSupport RAT is executed using renamed or obfuscated binaries or if the attacker has installed the software in standard directories with legitimate naming conventions. Additionally, if the process is executed on systems where logging is enabled but improperly configured, the relevant telemetry may be absent. It's crucial to note that defenders should remain vigilant against RATs that employ evasive tactics, including alternative execution methods or scripting to bypass detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The "DumpMinitool Execution" detection rule is designed to identify the execution of the DumpMinitool, a utility that facilitates the extraction of process memory using the Windows API function `MiniDumpWriteDump`. This tool can be leveraged both for legitimate debugging purposes and by malicious actors to capture sensitive information from memory, such as credentials and execution context of applications. The rule triggers on specific indicators, such as the execution of either the DumpMinitool executable or its variations, and checks for particular command-line parameters that indicate attempts to capture process memory (e.g., "Full", "Mini", "WithHeap"). 
  The detection primarily utilizes Windows process creation logs, focusing on the `Image` paths of the executable and specific patterns in the `CommandLine` parameters. This relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques under the tactics of defense evasion (T1036) and credential dumping (T1003.001), where attackers may attempt to use memory dumps to extract authentication information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify File Origin:** Check the 'Image' path in the process creation logs using EDR to establish if the DumpMinitool was executed from a trusted location or a potentially suspicious directory.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Review the command-line arguments associated with the process to identify any unusual flags that may indicate malicious intent or common use cases of the tool in legitimate scenarios.
  - **Cross-reference Activity:** Use the SIEM to correlate the execution with other logs (e.g., network connections, process access) to detect if the process is part of an ongoing malicious activity or campaign.
  - **Review Relevant User Activity:** Inspect user behavior leading up to the execution of DumpMinitool to determine if it aligns with normal operational patterns or if there are indicators of compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level assigned to this alert is justified due to the potential misuse of the DumpMinitool for credential dumping and other malicious activities, which could lead to data breaches if left unchecked. Immediate investigation is advised to mitigate risks associated with sensitive data exposure.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where the DumpMinitool is not widely used, or if the tool has been renamed or executed in a manner that bypasses detection (e.g., through a different directory). Additionally, if legitimate users employ DumpMinitool with the flagged command-line parameters for valid purposes, this may contribute to false positives. Furthermore, the efficacy of this detection depends on comprehensive logging configurations and may be affected if Windows Event Logs or Sysmon data is improperly configured or missing.

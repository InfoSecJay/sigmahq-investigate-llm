  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where the `rundll32.exe` process is executed without any command-line parameters, which can indicate suspicious or malicious activity, particularly associated with Cobalt Strike beacons. `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to run functions from DLLs, but it is often misused by threat actors to execute payloads stealthily. The rule primarily analyzes process creation events captured via Windows Security logs (specifically the `process_creation` category) to detect such occurrences. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic associated with this rule is **Defense Evasion** under the technique T1202, which discusses how adversaries may hide their activities to evade detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution for instances of `rundll32.exe` launching without command-line parameters. Pay attention to unusual parent processes, especially those originating from user profile paths like `\AppData\Local\`.
  - **Analyze Parent Process:** Investigate the parent process of the detected `rundll32.exe` instance. Identify whether it is a legitimate application (e.g., Microsoft Edge) or if it is potentially malicious, guiding further steps in your investigation.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Use network detection tools to check for any outgoing connections or unexpected DNS queries associated with the timing of the `rundll32.exe` execution. Suspicious network activity may further indicate a compromised environment.
  - **Review Endpoint Security Alerts:** Consult your AV and EDR solution to check if any alerts or indicators of compromise (IOCs) align with the execution of `rundll32.exe`. This can help identify if similar activities have been flagged as malicious.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered high severity due to the potential association with advanced threats, such as Cobalt Strike, which are known for utilizing this method to execute payloads stealthily. Prompt investigation is critical to mitigate possible breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are known blind spots for this rule, such as environments where 'rundll32.exe' is occasionally called legitimately without parameters or through trusted applications that may not trigger the detection. Furthermore, if attackers leverage alternate methods to execute DLL functions or use different tools entirely, this rule may not trigger, leaving the environment vulnerable. Assumptions made include that command-line visibility is adequately configured in the monitoring tools.

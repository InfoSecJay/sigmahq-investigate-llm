  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Serv-U Process Pattern" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious activity stemming from the Serv-U application on Windows systems. Specifically, it monitors for processes that are executed as child processes of `Serv-U.exe`, which could indicate that an attacker is leveraging this service to execute harmful commands. The rule identifies suspicious command-line utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, and others that are commonly used in exploitation scenarios. By analyzing the process creation logs from the Windows event system, this rule aims to capture instances where the Serv-U service is being exploited, indicating a possible security breach. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the tactic of Credential Access (T1555), which illustrates how adversaries may seek to obtain necessary credentials for further system compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Trees:** Utilize your EDR to analyze the process tree for instances of Serv-U.exe and its child processes, focusing on the command-line parameters used during their execution.
  - **Review Event Logs:** Look into Windows Security and System event logs for any unusual or elevated access requests that may have occurred in conjunction with the detected suspicious processes.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to assess any outgoing connections made by Serv-U or related processes that may indicate data exfiltration or communication with known malicious IPs.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference identified processes and their behavior against threat intelligence databases to verify if they match known exploit patterns or actors targeting Serv-U.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level of this alert, it is crucial that it is treated as a potential ongoing exploit attempt targeting the Serv-U service, warranting immediate investigation to prevent further compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in scenarios where other legitimate processes are initiated under the Serv-U service or if the usage of command-line tools is benign and expected. Additionally, the rule assumes that Serv-U is running in the default configuration; any custom modifications could nullify the detection. Adversaries might also employ techniques to obscure their activities, such as process renaming or execution through less suspicious utilities.

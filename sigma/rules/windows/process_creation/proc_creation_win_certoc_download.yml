  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potentially unauthorized file downloads conducted via `CertOC.exe`, a tool often used for Certificate Management in Windows environments. The rule leverages process creation logs to specifically look for instances where `CertOC.exe` is executed with a command line that includes both the `-GetCACAPS` argument and an `http` URL. These command-line parameters suggest that the tool is being misused to retrieve files from external sources, which could indicate a command-and-control (C2) activity in line with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer). By monitoring process creation events, SOC analysts can respond to suspicious activities that can bypass traditional file download protections.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Investigate the `CertOC.exe` process creation event in your EDR solution to gather details such as User Account, Parent Process, and Timestamp to confirm the context of execution.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Utilize your NDR to analyze outgoing network traffic associated with the `CertOC.exe` process for connections to potentially malicious or unknown IP addresses or URLs.
  - **Audit System Logs:** Check Windows Security and Application Event Logs for any other related activity by the user that might indicate account compromise or misuse of legitimate tools.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Review user activity logs, including PowerShell or command-line histories, to determine if the download was part of a broader set of actions that could suggest malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered medium severity due to the use of `CertOC.exe` in a non-standard manner, indicating a potential security incident that warrants further investigation, but may also have legitimate use cases in your environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to fire if `CertOC.exe` is invoked using different command-line arguments or if the executable is renamed or replaced by an adversary. Additionally, it assumes that all instances of `CertOC.exe` will be logged appropriately; improper logging configurations could result in missed detections. Analysts should be aware that attackers may use legitimate tools within their operational process to avoid detection.

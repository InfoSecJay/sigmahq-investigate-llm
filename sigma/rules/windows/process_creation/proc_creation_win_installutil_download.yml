  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify the use of the .NET utility `InstallUtil.exe` to download arbitrary files from remote locations using HTTP or FTP protocols. The rule specifically looks for instances where `InstallUtil.exe` is executed, coupled with command-line parameters that indicate a file download from URLs. When triggered, the downloaded files are likely stored in the local cache at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\IE\`. This behavior is attributed to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), which focuses on utilizing trusted binaries to execute potentially malicious activities in a stealthy manner. Monitoring for this activity allows detection of potential attempts at evading defenses and conducting further malicious operations on the compromised machine.
  The primary data sources leveraged for this rule include process creation logs that capture the execution of processes and their associated command-line parameters, specifically looking for signatures of `InstallUtil.exe` along with specific URL patterns indicating file downloads. By analyzing these logs, security teams can effectively flag suspicious behavior before it escalates into larger security incidents.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin**: Check the origin of the `InstallUtil.exe` process through EDR or Sysmon logs to ensure it has not been tampered with or originated from an unusual source.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments**: Review the command-line arguments used during the execution of `InstallUtil.exe` for any suspicious URLs or additional flags that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Analyze Downloaded Files**: Investigate the files written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\IE\` to determine their nature, utilizing antivirus and static analysis tools to classify their risk levels.
  - **Review Network Connections**: Utilize network traffic logs from NDR or NGFW to analyze outbound connections made during the execution of `InstallUtil.exe` for any unusual or unauthorized data transfers.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is categorized as medium due to the potential for `InstallUtil.exe` to be exploited for nefarious purposes, such as downloading malware or other data exfiltration tools, which could lead to further compromise of the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `InstallUtil.exe` is executed under a different context or with modified parameters that do not match the specified patterns. It also assumes proper logging for process creation is enabled; if logs are not maintained or are incomplete, the rule may fail to detect the activity. Adversaries might employ obfuscation techniques, such as using other legitimate binaries that perform similar functions or disguising malicious URLs, thereby evading detection.

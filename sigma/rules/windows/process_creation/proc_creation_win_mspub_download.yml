  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Arbitrary File Download Via MSPUB.EXE" is designed to detect suspicious instances where Microsoft Publisher (MSPUB.EXE) is used to download files from external sources. This is noteworthy because MSPUB.EXE is not typically associated with file downloading, making such behavior potentially indicative of malicious activity. The rule leverages process creation logs to monitor instances of MSPUB.EXE and inspects their command-line parameters for any use of protocols like FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS intended for downloading files. This detection method falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically targeting the "Execution" tactic (T1218), which addresses the use of trusted applications to execute adversarial behaviors.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Examine recent process creation logs in your SIEM for instances of MSPUB.EXE while paying particular attention to associated command-line parameters that contain file download URLs.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Review alerts and activities flagged by your EDR solution that involve MSPUB.EXE or related file operations around the same timestamp to identify any anomalous behavior or patterns.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Analyze network connections and traffic originating from the endpoint where MSPUB.EXE was executed. Look specifically for connections to FTP or web services corresponding to the command-line arguments.
  - **Query for File Modifications:** Use file integrity monitoring tools to check if any unexpected files were downloaded and saved in local or shared directories following the execution of MSPUB.EXE.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the nature of arbitrary file downloads, this alert is assigned a medium severity level. Such activity could lead to potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access, requiring prompt investigation to ascertain the intentions behind the download.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if MSPUB.EXE is executed in a manner that does not involve direct command-line parameters for file downloads, such as through interactive user inputs or specific legitimate business processes. Additionally, the detection relies on accurate logging configurations, and any misconfigurations could lead to missed detections. Finally, adversaries may attempt to obfuscate their actions by using different legitimate applications, which could bypass this specific rule.

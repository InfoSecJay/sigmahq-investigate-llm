  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "HackTool 
  - SharpMove Tool Execution" is designed to detect the execution of SharpMove, a .NET utility commonly used for various tasks related to lateral movement within a network. Specifically, the rule targets the process creation events associated with the `SharpMove.exe` executable, leveraging Windows Sysmon logs to identify its presence. The rule looks for specific characteristics in the command-line parameters that indicate malicious activities, such as creating tasks, querying services, or executing scripts via WMI. By monitoring the process execution indicators including the image filename, original file name, and particular command-line flags, incident responders can identify potential unauthorized use of this tool in their environment. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic for Lateral Movement, particularly technique T1021.002 (Remote Services: Windows Remote Management).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Behavior:** Use EDR tools to analyze the behavior of the process `SharpMove.exe`. Investigate additional processes spawned by it or any unusual network connections established.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect command-line parameters captured in Security logs or Sysmon logs for suspicious actions such as those related to DCOM, VBS scripts, or task creation commands.
  - **Conduct File Verification:** Verify the integrity and origin of `SharpMove.exe` through its hash in security solutions or threat intelligence sources to ensure it is not a tampered or malicious version.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Review proxy and NDR logs to identify any outbound connections initiated by `SharpMove.exe`, focusing on targets and data exfiltration patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high severity level assigned to this alert, the detection of `SharpMove.exe` indicates a significant risk for lateral movement and potential compromise across systems, necessitating immediate investigation and response.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this rule may be limited if the executable path or name is altered by malicious actors to evade detection. Additionally, if `SharpMove.exe` is executed with non-standard command-line parameters or using alternative execution methods not captured by this rule, such as through other scripts or scheduled tasks, this alert may not trigger. It is essential for detection engineers to consider the wider context of security events around this tool to improve coverage.

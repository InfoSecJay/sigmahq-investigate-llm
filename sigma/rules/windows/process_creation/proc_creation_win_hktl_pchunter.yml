  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "HackTool 
  - PCHunter Execution" is designed to identify the execution of PCHunter, a tool often utilized by attackers to explore and manipulate system processes and memory. This rule focuses on detecting process creation events specifically for PCHunter executables, which include both 64-bit and 32-bit versions. The rule utilizes data sources such as process creation logs where it inspects the image names and checks for specific file hashes associated with PCHunter. The identified techniques correspond to the MITRE ATT&CK framework under tactics like Execution (T1082), Discovery (T1057), and others, which focus on the use of tools that provide low-level system interaction, often employed by adversaries during their operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to examine logs for any recent process creation events related to PCHunter, focusing on timestamps around the alert and the user context.
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters**: Analyze command-line arguments passed to the detected PCHunter processes to identify any suspicious operations or flags that may suggest malicious intent.
  - **Correlate with User Behavior**: Investigate user account activity surrounding the alert, including login patterns and other executed applications to determine if there are anomalies indicative of compromise.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Utilize NDR to monitor for any related outbound connections made by the PCHunter process that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control communications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been classified as high severity due to the potential risk associated with the use of hacking tools like PCHunter, which can facilitate further malicious activities against enterprise systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the PCHunter executables are renamed or modified in a way that circumvents detection, as the rule relies on specific image names and hashes. Additionally, if defense mechanisms are in place that block or log the execution of such tools prior to process creation, the rule will not trigger. It is assumed that environments with robust endpoint controls might have less exposure to the execution of known hacking tools.

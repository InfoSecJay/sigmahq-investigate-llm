title: Potential Application Whitelisting Bypass via Dnx.EXE
id: 81ebd28b-9607-4478-bf06-974ed9d53ed7
status: test
description: |
  Detects the execution of Dnx.EXE. The Dnx utility allows for the execution of C# code.
  Attackers might abuse this in order to bypass application whitelisting.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors the execution of `Dnx.EXE`, a command-line utility for running C# code. Since it allows arbitrary code execution, attackers may exploit it to bypass application whitelisting mechanisms that are in place to prevent unapproved software from executing. The rule focuses on process creation logs specifically looking for the execution of `dnx.exe` to identify potential misuse. This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion (Tactics: defense-evasion, Techniques: T1218, T1027.004), indicating its relevance in accessing and executing code without typical restrictions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Check EDR or Sysmon logs for entries related to `dnx.exe` execution, noting any command-line parameters that are unusual for legitimate use cases.
  - **Review User Context:** Identify the user accounts that executed `dnx.exe`. Validate if these accounts typically require the use of this tool or if it's being executed under suspicious circumstances.
  - **Monitor for related activities:** Investigate further by analyzing subsequent processes spawned by `dnx.exe`, especially those that access sensitive resources or perform actions typical of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - **Check Application Whitelisting Configuration:** Confirm that application whitelisting is properly configured to ensure any legitimate use of `dnx.exe` is accounted for, and identify any potential gaps in its coverage.
  ### Prioritization
  When `dnx.exe` is executed, it raises a medium severity alert since its functionality can pose a significant risk of bypassing application controls. The context of its usage and the environment it runs in will determine the urgency of the investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the application whitelisting mechanism is entirely bypassed by an attacker or if `dnx.exe` is executed from a location that's not consistently monitored. Additionally, this detection assumes that logs are correctly configured to capture all instances of `dnx.exe` execution; inconsistencies in logging could lead to missed detections. Furthermore, the rule might generate false positives during legitimate use cases, where authorized users require `dnx.exe` for development purposes.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Dumping of Sensitive Hives Via Reg.EXE" is designed to detect instances where the `reg.exe` utility is utilized to dump sensitive Windows registry hives, specifically the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY hives. These hives are critical as they contain sensitive information such as user credentials and system configuration, making them prime targets for credential theft. The detection logic leverages process creation logs that capture the invocation of `reg.exe`, focusing on specific command-line parameters that indicate attempts to save or export these sensitive hives. Key indicators include references to "hklm" (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) and paths typically associated with the sensitive hives.
  This rule is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques for Credential Access, particularly T1003.002 (Credential Dumping: NTDS.dit), T1003.004 (Credential Dumping: Security Hive), and T1003.005 (Credential Dumping: SAM). By correlating the execution of the `reg.exe` process with the unauthorized attempts to interact with these critical registry components, the detection rule effectively identifies potential malicious activities aimed at credential harvesting.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to investigate process creation logs that captured the execution of `reg.exe`, focusing on the user context and timestamps to evaluate suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters**: Check the command-line arguments used with `reg.exe`, specifically look for instances of "save" or "export" along with references to sensitive hives (SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY) to confirm intent.
  - **Investigate User Account Activity**: Correlate the alert with user account logs from Active Directory or other user management systems to determine if the account used for the command had appropriate permissions or if it appears compromised.
  - **Search for Supporting Artifacts**: Examine related logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs) that could provide additional context around the execution, such as login events or other processes executed around the same timeframe.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert is classified as high severity, any detection of attempts to dump sensitive registry hives indicates potential credential theft and poses a significant risk to the organization. Immediate investigation is warranted to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate any possible breach.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not capture scenarios where an attacker modifies the command-line arguments to avoid detection, or uses alternative tools or methods (e.g., PowerShell scripts) to access the registry without invoking `reg.exe`. Additionally, legitimate administrative activities that involve backing up or inspecting the registry may trigger false positives. Engineers should be aware of these potential blind spots and consider implementing complementary detection strategies to enhance coverage.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the Remote Utilities Remote Access Tool (RURAT) from atypical locations on Windows systems, specifically locations outside of the standard installation directories (`C:\Program Files\Remote Utilities` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\Remote Utilities`). It looks for the execution of processes associated with this tool, namely `rutserv.exe` and `rfusclient.exe`, through process creation logs. When these executables are observed launching from a directory that does not match the expected paths, it potentially indicates an attempt by an attacker to disguise or manipulate their activities. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion," specifically focusing on the technique related to process execution from unexpected locations.
  The logs sourced for this detection come primarily from Windows process creation events, providing visibility into new process launches and their originating paths. By capturing and analyzing these events, security analysts can identify potentially malicious behaviors that deviate from established norms and investigate further to mitigate risks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the relevant Windows Security or Sysmon logs to confirm the execution of `rutserv.exe` or `rfusclient.exe` and note the directory from which the processes were launched. 
  - **Examine System Activity:** Utilize your EDR to correlate the execution event with other suspicious behavior on the endpoint, such as unusual network connections or file modifications.
  - **Validate Process Integrity:** Check the legitimacy of the executables by comparing the hashes against known good values to determine if they have been altered or are potentially malicious.
  - **Review User Activity and Context:** Investigate the user account associated with the process execution to understand its usual activity profile and whether any other alerts coincide with the timeframe of this detection.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered medium severity within an enterprise environment due to the potential for Remote Utilities to be misused for unauthorized remote access. Detection of its execution from unusual locations warrants attention, as this may indicate a compromised system or malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the RURAT software is executed from its legitimate installation directories, thereby bypassing detection thresholds. Additionally, it assumes that process creation logs are being captured effectively across all endpoints and that no tampering occurs with logging configurations or executables. Organizations should also be aware that sophisticated adversaries may employ techniques to obfuscate the location from which they run malicious tools.

title: Dllhost.EXE Execution Anomaly
id: e7888eb1-13b0-4616-bd99-4bc0c2b054b9
status: test
description: Detects a "dllhost" process spawning with no commandline arguments which
  is very rare to happen and could indicate process injection activity or malware
  mimicking similar system processes.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Dllhost.EXE Execution Anomaly" is designed to identify unusual instances of the `dllhost.exe` process that execute without command-line arguments. `dllhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process known for hosting COM objects, should ideally carry specific command-line parameters during execution. An anomaly occurs when this process is instantiated without any arguments, which is a very rare scenario and could signify attempts to carry out process injection or the presence of malware that mimics legitimate system processes. This rule leverages data from Windows process creation logs to scrutinize instances of `dllhost.exe` for the absence of command-line parameters, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055 (Process Injection), categorized under the defense evasion tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Identify Process Context:** Use your EDR tool to examine the process tree for instances of `dllhost.exe` identified in the alerts, paying attention to parent processes and any related suspicious-looking processes.
    
  - **Retrieve Command-Line Arguments:** Query Windows Event Logs for detailed command-line invocations associated with the flagged `dllhost.exe` processes to discern if there are truly no command-line arguments provided or if they are simply obscured.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Utilize your NDR or firewall logs to investigate any outbound network connections that may have been made by the `dllhost.exe` processes, as these can indicate an ongoing command and control mechanism.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Consult user login and activity logs to determine if the timing of the process instantiation aligns with known user activities or if it appears to be unassociated with any legitimate actions.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert severity level is high because the execution of `dllhost.exe` without command-line arguments is atypical and may indicate malicious activity, such as process injection, which poses a significant threat to enterprise security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is important to note that this rule may not trigger in environments where benign instances of `dllhost.exe` run without command-line arguments, potentially leading to false negatives. Additionally, skilled adversaries may use process hollowing or other techniques to disguise their activities, potentially bypassing this detection method. The effectiveness of this rule is contingent on accurate and timely logging from the Windows process creation logs; if these logs are not enabled or properly monitored, the rule may fail to execute as intended.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify instances of the Crassus execution tool, which is a Windows-based privilege escalation discovery utility. The rule specifically looks for the occurrence of a process named `Crassus.exe`, examining process creation logs for specific indicators such as the image name, original file name, and a description that contains the term "Crassus". These parameters allow threat detection systems to flag the execution of this potentially unwanted application (PUA), which may be used to assist in unauthorized privilege escalation or reconnaissance activities. The rule is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Discovery, specifically the technique T1590.001, which covers the use of tools for enumerating system information that could lead to exploitation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Initial Alert Verification:** Check the EDR console for recent alerts or logs involving `Crassus.exe` to confirm the alert's validity and understand the context of its execution.
  - **Process Tree Analysis:** Utilize your process analysis tools to examine the parent-child process relationships to identify how `Crassus.exe` was launched and what other processes were executed at the same time.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Analyze the network connection logs (NDR) for any suspicious outbound connections made during the time `Crassus.exe` was running, focusing on unusual or unauthorized endpoints.
  - **Check User Context:** Inspect Windows Event Logs for user logon events around the time of the alert to determine whether the process was run by an authorized or unauthorized user.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert raised by this rule is of high severity in an enterprise environment, as the execution of tools like Crassus may indicate a prelude to a privilege escalation attempt, potentially leading to wider system compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary renames or obfuscates the `Crassus.exe` file or if it executes with alternate methods that bypass standard process creation logging. Additionally, if the tool is executed on systems where logging is not enabled or properly configured, it may fail to be detected. The rule assumes that there will be proper logging enabled on Windows systems; if logging settings have been altered or disabled, critical insights may be lost.

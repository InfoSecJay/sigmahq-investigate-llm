  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the usage of the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-ADUser`, which can be used to collect sensitive user information from Active Directory (AD) and write that information to a file. The detection occurs by monitoring process creation events on Windows systems, specifically looking for PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`) that include command lines indicative of user enumeration and data export activities. The command line must not only contain the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet with a filter argument but also include redirection symbols such as `>` or piping operations to output user data into files. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery), as adversaries may utilize this information to gather intelligence about user accounts in a targeted environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Tool**: Investigate the endpoint where the alert was triggered using the EDR tool to examine running processes, and identify if there were any abnormal behaviors or other malicious commands executed around the same timeframe.
  - **Review PowerShell Logs**: Analyze Windows PowerShell logs for any suspicious command executions, especially focusing on user context, time, and any preceding commands that led to the usage of `Get-ADUser`.
  - **Examine Network Activity**: Utilize network traffic analysis tools to review outbound traffic from the affected machine during the alert window, looking for any potentially malicious data exfiltration events.
  - **Interview Relevant Users**: Speak to administrators or users who work with AD to confirm if the usage of `Get-ADUser` was part of legitimate administrative activities or if further investigation is warranted.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert indicates potential unauthorized access to sensitive user data, it is assigned a medium severity level. While legitimate administrative tasks may trigger this rule, it is essential to investigate to confirm whether the action was executed by a legitimate user or potentially an adversary.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an adversary employs obfuscation techniques to disguise their PowerShell commands or uses alternative scripting languages to interact with Active Directory. Furthermore, legitimate administrative uses of `Get-ADUser` in regular operations can result in false positives. It is essential to consider user context and exclude known legitimate sources to minimize noise in alerting.

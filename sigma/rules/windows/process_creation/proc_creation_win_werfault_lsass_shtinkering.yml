  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential credential dumping activities that exploit Windows Error Reporting (WER), particularly using the `WerFault.exe` process to access and extract sensitive information from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). The technique leverages command-line parameters indicative of requests made to `WerFault.exe`, such as `-u`, `-p`, and `-ip`, where the `-p` parameter refers to the process ID of LSASS while the `-ip` indicates a different process. If the parent image is `lsass.exe`, the presence of a command line that seeks to manipulate this process suggests a malicious intent for credential dumping. This rule ties into the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the credential access tactic (T1003.001), which alerts to methods of harvesting credentials through process exploits.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate EDR Alerts**: Check the EDR for additional alerts related to suspicious process activities surrounding `WerFault.exe` and `lsass.exe` to gather context about potentially malicious behaviors.
  - **Review Command-Line Parameters**: Analyze the CommandLine entries associated with the alert. Focus on the `-p` and `-ip` parameters to confirm if `lsass.exe` is targeted.
  - **Check Event Logs**: Look into Windows Event Logs related to process creation for `WerFault.exe`. Correlate the timestamps of these logs with the occurrence of the alert for a more accurate evaluation.
  - **Investigate Parent-Child Relationships**: Utilize the EDR or Sysinternals tools to inspect the parent-child relationship of processes, ensuring that there is no legitimate use case for the observed command line involving `WerFault.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the high-level severity assigned to this alert, it represents a critical situation for the enterpriseâ€”highlighting potential unauthorized access to sensitive user credentials. Prompt investigation is imperative to mitigate risks associated with such credential exploitation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger under certain conditions, such as in environments where Windows Error Reporting is disabled or where legitimate software is innocently invoking `WerFault.exe` with similar command-line parameters. Additionally, adversaries might use alternate methods or encrypted techniques to bypass detection. It is important to remember that not all instances of `WerFault.exe` will be malicious; false positives can arise from legitimate processes. Understanding the context around the process executions is crucial for accurate incident response.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify instances where the Notepad++ updater utility (GUP.exe) is executed from a parent process other than Notepad++. Specifically, the rule captures process creation events where GUP.exe is initiated by a different executable, indicating potential misuse for unauthorized file downloads. The detection relies on process creation logs, particularly looking for the image name "GUP.exe", the original filename being "gup.exe", and a command line containing ' -unzipTo ' along with a URL (indicating a file download). By analyzing these parameters, the rule highlights anomalous behavior consistent with adversarial tactics, particularly under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the Command and Control (T1105) technique.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to inspect the process creation events for GUP.exe. Check the parent process to confirm if it is indeed from Notepad++ or another unrecognized process.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the parameters passed to GUP.exe as captured in the logs. Look for specific clues that might indicate the nature of the download, such as suspicious URLs or file types.
    
  - **Cross-Reference Network Activity:** Use NDR solutions to correlate any network traffic associated with the execution of GUP.exe. Identify if the traffic indicates downloads from any known malicious domains or IPs.
    
  - **Check for Related Files and Downloads:** Investigate any files downloaded by the GUP process. Analyze the file hashes against threat intelligence sources to determine if they are known malware.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for data exfiltration or malicious file downloads initiated through an unexpected process, which could indicate a compromised environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if GUP.exe is executed by a legitimate parent process outside of Notepad++ if there are unidentified benign applications utilizing the updater. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries may employ techniques to obfuscate executable properties or manipulate command-line arguments to disguise malicious intentions, thereby evading detection.

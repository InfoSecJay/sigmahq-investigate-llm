  ### Technical Context
  This rule is designed to detect the use of the `reg.exe` command-line utility to disable Protected Process Light service (PPL) protection for the Local Security Authority (LSA) process. PPL protection helps safeguard sensitive components of the operating system, such as the LSA, from unauthorized modifications, thereby enhancing the integrity and security of protective measures against certain types of malware that aim to access credentials. When an attacker attempts to disable this protection, they may leverage `reg.exe` to modify the registry settings under `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`, specifically by adding the value `RunAsPPL` and setting it to `0`. This action is indicative of potential defense evasion tactics employed by malware or threat actors, as categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactic of defense evasion (T1562.010).
  The detection leverages process creation logs from Windows, focusing on the image path and command-line parameters used with `reg.exe`. The rule looks for instances where the command prepared includes specific flags indicating a direct manipulation of LSAâ€™s protection settings, encapsulating a critical moment where security could be compromised.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to investigate the process creation logs around the time of the alert to identify any unauthorized or suspicious executions of `reg.exe`.
  - **Check Command Line Parameters:** Examine the command line arguments that were passed to `reg.exe` for any additional context that may clarify the intent of the operation, particularly looking for `/d 0` and `/v RunAsPPL`.
  - **Monitor System Integrity:** Utilize Windows Security and System logs to analyze if there were any prior indications of compromise or unusual activity leading up to the modification of LSA settings.
  - **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence:** Corroborate findings with documented attack patterns from threat intelligence sources to evaluate if the observed actions align with known adversary tactics associated with credential theft or persistence techniques.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is high due to the potential implications of disabling LSA PPL protection, which could enable an attacker to bypass security protocols designed to safeguard sensitive system processes. This action could lead to credential theft, unauthorized access, and further compromise of the system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious activity is attempted using alternate methods beyond the `reg.exe` utility, such as direct API calls or other registry manipulation tools. Additionally, if the process is executed under a legitimate context or by a trusted administrator, it may result in false negatives. There is also an assumption that sufficient logging is enabled on the target systems to capture and relay these process creation events. Any changes in registry permissions or lack of Sysmon granularity could lead to blind spots during detection.

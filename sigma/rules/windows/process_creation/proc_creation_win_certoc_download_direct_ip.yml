  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where the `CertOC.exe` utility is used to download files from an IP-based URL. The `CertOC.exe` is typically a legitimate Windows executable used to manage certificate operations, but it can be exploited by attackers to download malicious files from suspicious sources. The rule examines the `process_creation` logs specifically looking for command-line invocations of `CertOC.exe` that contain a command to fetch certificate capabilities (indicative of potentially downloading unwanted content), specifically filtering by the presence of IP addresses in the URL. The detection leverages Windows Event Logs, capturing key details such as the process image name and command-line parameters. This rule is related to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1203) and Command and Control (T1105), indicating a potential compromise vector that adversaries may exploit during an attack.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:**
    Review the process creation events for `CertOC.exe` in the EDR console, focusing on timestamps and parent processes to understand the context of this execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:**
    Examine the command-line arguments associated with the `CertOC.exe` process in the process creation logs to validate the presence of suspicious IP-based URLs.
  - **Verify Network Connections:**
    Utilize network threat detection tools to inspect outbound connections made from `CertOC.exe` to any IP addresses accessed during the timeframe of the alert for any known malicious domains or anomalous traffic patterns.
  - **Review User Activity:**
    Conduct a user activity review in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) logs to determine whether the user who initiated the command had legitimate intentions or was potentially compromised.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as high severity due to the potential for `CertOC.exe` being utilized as a malicious tool for data exfiltration or downloading malware, which can pose significant threats to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `CertOC.exe` is executed with different command-line parameters or from a location where it is not detected. Additionally, legitimate applications may also use `CertOC.exe` for benign purposes, leading to false positives. If the attacker deploys obfuscation techniques or uses other command-line tools to download files, the detection may fail. Awareness of how this executable can be abused in conjunction with network filtering rules is crucial for improving detection capabilities.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Potential Remote Desktop Tunneling" detection rule identifies potential attempts to establish a remote desktop protocol (RDP) connection over a reverse SSH tunnel. This technique, which is associated with lateral movement (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: T1021), is used by adversaries to bypass traditional network controls and gain unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data. The rule operates by monitoring the command-line arguments of process creation events on Windows systems, specifically looking for any instances where the command includes either the RDP port `:3389` or common SSH tunneling flags such as `-L`, `-P`, `-R`, `-pw`, and `-ssh`. By leveraging Windows process creation logs, the rule helps detect possible malicious activities related to tunneling that would otherwise remain hidden in the network traffic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Detected Alerts:** Utilize your EDR solution to gather details about the process associated with the alert. Investigate the command line used, the parent process, and the user context under which it was executed to assess legitimacy.
    
  - **Correlate with Network Logs:** Check Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions or firewall logs for any unusual outbound connections originating from the affected host. Look for connections to known SSH servers that correspond with the time of the alert.
  - **Analyze User Behavior:** Examine Windows Security event logs for any abnormal user behavior leading up to the detection. This should include any logins from unusual locations or times that may suggest an account compromise.
  - **Inspect for artifacts:** Conduct a forensic examination of the affected machine using tools like Sysmon to identify any potential remnants of the SSH utility or reverse tunnel configurations that may suggest sustained access.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is classified as medium due to the potential risk posed by adversaries leveraging tunneling techniques to gain unauthorized access to systems, which could facilitate further exploitation and data breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may fail to trigger if the malicious actors utilize non-standard SSH utilities or port numbers to establish the tunnel, or if they have modified their command-line arguments to avoid detection. Additionally, if logging is not sufficiently detailed or if the affected system doesn't have the appropriate logging enabled, awareness of such activity may be limited. Analysts should assume that sophisticated adversaries may employ obfuscation techniques to defeat this detection.

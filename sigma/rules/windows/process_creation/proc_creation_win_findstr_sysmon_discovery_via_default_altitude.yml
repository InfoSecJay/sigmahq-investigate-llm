title: Sysmon Discovery Via Default Driver Altitude Using Findstr.EXE
id: 37db85d1-b089-490a-a59a-c7b6f984f480
status: test
description: Detects usage of "findstr" with the argument "385201". Which could indicate
  potential discovery of an installed Sysinternals Sysmon service using the default
  driver altitude (even if the name is changed).

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for the potential discovery of the Sysinternals Sysmon service via the command-line tool `findstr.exe`, specifically searching with the argument `385201`. In a Windows environment, this argument corresponds to the default altitude of the Sysmon driver. When malicious actors are attempting to ascertain the presence of security tools such as Sysmon, they may execute commands that use `findstr.exe` to filter output for specific terms, signaling their intent to evade detection or reconnaissance efforts. The primary data sources leveraged for this detection include process creation logs, specifically focusing on command line parameters for the executed processes `find.exe` and `findstr.exe`. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Tactic: **Discovery** and Technique: **Security Software Discovery** (T1518.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Identify Process Execution:** Use EDR tools to review process execution logs for instances of `findstr.exe` with the argument `385201` to determine when and where this command was executed.
  - **Examine Parent Process:** Investigate the parent process associated with the `findstr.exe` command to gather context about its execution, including the user account that initiated the activity and any related processes that may indicate malicious intent.
  - **Check for Additional Indicators:** Utilize Windows Security logs and Sysmon event logs to identify if other suspicious commands were executed around the same time, which may suggest a broader malicious activity or reconnaissance operation.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Analyze Network Detection and Response (NDR) logs to assess if any unusual or unauthorized network connections were made by the system that executed the command, providing further insight into potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as **high severity** due to its implications for discovering security monitoring tools within the environment. Such reconnaissance can be a precursor to further malicious activity, warranting immediate investigation to mitigate potential risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if adversaries utilize alternate command-line tools to conduct similar reconnaissance or if they modify command-line arguments to avoid detection. Additionally, environments with misconfigured logging settings might not capture the necessary process creation events for `findstr.exe`. Analysts should also consider scenarios where benign administrative scripts could use similar commands, which could lead to false positives. Understanding the operational environment thoroughly will help reduce unnecessary alerts and ensure more accurate detection.

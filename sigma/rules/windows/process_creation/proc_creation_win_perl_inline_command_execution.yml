  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Perl Inline Command Execution" is designed to detect instances of Perl being executed with the `-e` or `-E` flags, which allow users to execute Perl code directly from the command line. These flags can be misused by attackers to launch reverse shells or execute arbitrary code, often serving as a method for exploitation during an attack. The rule focuses specifically on process creation logs from Windows systems, particularly monitoring the `perl.exe` executable and analyzing command-line arguments for the presence of the specified flags. Employing a combination of checks on the executable's image and original file name, this detection aims to identify suspicious inline command executions that may indicate malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR for recent executions of `perl.exe`, paying close attention to the command-line arguments that include the `-e` or `-E` flags.
  - Utilize the SIEM to correlate any relevant alerts related to this detection with historical activity that may indicate prior compromises or patterns of abuse.
  - Check the network traffic logs (NDR or Proxy) for suspicious outbound connections that might align with reverse shell behavior initiated using Perl.
  - Examine user account activity in cloud logs to identify any unauthorized access or activity concurrent with the execution of `perl.exe`, ensuring to assess whether the account has been compromised.

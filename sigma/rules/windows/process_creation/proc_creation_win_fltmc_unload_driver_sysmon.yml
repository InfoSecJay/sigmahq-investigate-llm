  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Sysmon Driver Unloaded Via Fltmc.EXE" is designed to detect the unloading of Sysmon filter drivers using the `fltmc.exe` utility. Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service and device driver that logs system activity to the Windows Event Log, providing invaluable forensic data. When an unauthorized or unexpected unloading of a Sysmon driver occurs, it may indicate malicious activity aimed at evading detection or modifying system behavior. The rule specifically looks for the execution of `fltmc.exe` with command-line parameters that contain both "unload" and "sysmon." The primary technical data sources involved in this detection are Windows Event Logs related to process creation, particularly logging the execution of `fltmc.exe` along with its command-line activities. This detection context relates to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, specifically under the tactics of Defense Evasion (T1070) and Process Injection (T1562).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Process Information:** Review the endpoint EDR for any instances of `fltmc.exe` execution to understand the process context and any associated user activity.
  - **Analyze Sysmon Event Logs:** Filter Sysmon event logs for process creation events related to `fltmc.exe` to validate the timing and conditions surrounding the driver unload action.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Investigate network logs for any unusual external connections initiated around the same timeframe that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control activity.
  - **Review Application and Security Logs:** Examine application and Windows Security event logs for other anomalies, such as unexpected logins or policy changes that could correlate with the driver unload event.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential implications of an attacker attempting to disable or bypass Sysmon's monitoring capabilities, which could significantly hinder incident response efforts and lead to undetected malicious activity within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where `fltmc.exe` is legitimately used for system maintenance or in specialized applications, leading to possible false negatives. Additionally, high-level privileges or administrative access may allow an adversary to employ stealthy methods to unload Sysmon filters, meaning that not all tactics would be detectable through this rule alone. Engineers should be aware that bypass techniques and substituted process names could evade detection.

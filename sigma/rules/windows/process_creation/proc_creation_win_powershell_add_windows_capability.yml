  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Add Windows Capability Via PowerShell Cmdlet" is designed to detect the usage of the Add-WindowsCapability cmdlet, which is used to add optional capabilities to Windows installations. This cmdlet can install notable capabilities such as OpenSSH, which may be exploited by threat actors to facilitate unauthorized remote access or lateral movement within a network. The rule leverages process creation logs from Windows to analyze PowerShell command executions, specifically looking for instances where the command line contains the phrase "Add-WindowsCapability" along with keywords like "OpenSSH" to identify potentially malicious activities. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution and specifically addresses the technique of command and scripting interpreter via PowerShell usage.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check PowerShell Logs:** Review recent PowerShell execution logs for any occurrences of the Add-WindowsCapability cmdlet to identify the context and user associated with this activity.
  - **Analyze Process Tree:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate the process tree of the detected PowerShell instance to determine related processes and whether any suspicious behavior was observed.
  - **User Context Review:** Examine the user account that executed the cmdlet. Investigate whether this user has the necessary permissions and assess if the usage aligns with normal operational behavior.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Check firewall or proxy logs to see if there were any unusual outbound network connections from the machine during the time frame of the cmdlet execution, as this could indicate potential exfiltration or command and control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as medium severity because while the legitimate use of the Add-WindowsCapability cmdlet can occur in administrative tasks, any unauthorized or unusual usage could indicate a compromise that warrants further investigation in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses direct API calls or other scripting methods to add capabilities without invoking PowerShell or the cmdlet name. Additionally, legitimate administrative actions may produce false positives, requiring further filtering or contextual scrutiny. It is also crucial to ensure that PowerShell logging is appropriately configured in the environments to detect such activities effectively.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule “Computer System Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE” is designed to detect the execution of the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility, specifically when it is used with the "computersystem" keyword. This command is often utilized by attackers for reconnaissance purposes, enabling them to collect sensitive information about a target system, such as domain names, usernames, machine models, and other operational details. The rule monitors process creation events, specifically focusing on processes initiated with wmic.exe as their image name and checks for the presence of the "computersystem" argument in the command line. By correlating this data, analysts can identify potentially malicious activity consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review process creation logs via EDR to understand the context of the wmic.exe execution, including the user account and timestamps associated with the command.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Inspect the full command-line execution string associated with the detected instance of wmic.exe to confirm whether the “computersystem” flag was used.
  - **Cross-Reference with Other Logs:** Utilize Windows Event Logs to verify any suspicious user activity around the same timeframe, checking for unusual logins or other command executions.
  - **Examine Network Activity:** Look into network traffic logs to determine any outbound connections that might indicate data exfiltration or further malicious attempts following the use of wmic.exe.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as medium severity because while the execution of wmic.exe can indicate legitimate administrative activities, its presence in unexpected contexts may signal pre-attack reconnaissance behavior that warrants further investigation in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Detection may be hindered by legitimate administrative use of WMIC for system inventory or management, which can lead to false positives. Additionally, if attackers employ methods to obscure the process or change command line parameters (e.g., using obfuscation techniques or different tools), the rule may fail to trigger. The assumption is that wmic.exe is not commonly used in your environment for administrative tasks, which would otherwise complicate event correlation.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential reconnaissance activities by monitoring for the execution of the `systeminfo.exe` command on Windows systems. `systeminfo` is a built-in Windows tool that provides comprehensive details about the operating system, including the machine's hostname, system architecture, and installed patches. Attackers may leverage this information to gather insights into the target environment as part of their reconnaissance phase, enhancing their strategies for further exploitation.
  The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the executable name ends with `\systeminfo.exe` or has an original file name of `sysinfo.exe`. This detection leverages Windows Process Creation logs, which capture details about newly executed processes, enabling security teams to identify and respond to suspicious usage patterns. In terms of MITRE ATT&CK, this activity aligns with the tactic of "Discovery" and the technique T1082, highlighting the importance of maintaining vigilance against unauthorized information gathering.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Examine recent process creation logs in Sysmon or Windows Security logs for instances of `systeminfo.exe` being executed, paying attention to the account under which the command was run.
    
  - **Analyze Parent Process**: Investigate the parent process of the `systeminfo` execution to determine if it was initiated by a legitimate application or another suspicious process, which could indicate a potential attack pattern.
  - **Review User Accounts**: Identify the user accounts associated with the execution of `systeminfo.exe`, particularly focusing on any non-admin or anomalously behaving user accounts that may have initiated the command.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Utilize network detection tools to check for any outbound connections that correspond with the timing of the `systeminfo.exe` executions, indicating potential data exfiltration or communication with malicious infrastructure.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as low severity since `systeminfo.exe` is a native tool, and its execution might also occur in legitimate administrative contexts. However, any unexpected usage patterns should be scrutinized closely to rule out reconnaissance attempts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several assumptions and limitations to this rule. First, legitimate users could run `systeminfo.exe` for routine checks, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an attacker is using alternative methods to gather system information that do not involve executing `systeminfo.exe`, such as leveraging PowerShell or WMI queries, this rule would not capture such activities. Also, if logging is misconfigured or disabled, the rule may fail to fire entirely.

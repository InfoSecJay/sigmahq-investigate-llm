  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule targets the execution of the `systeminfo` command, a legitimate Windows utility that retrieves detailed system information such as OS version, hardware configuration, and network settings. However, attackers may exploit this command during reconnaissance phases to gather system data prior to launching further attacks. The rule looks for process creation events where the executable ends with `\systeminfo.exe` or has an original file name of `sysinfo.exe`. This is monitored through process creation logs collected from Windows systems, providing insight into potentially unauthorized usage.
  Monitoring for the execution of `systeminfo` is crucial as it can be indicative of the early stages of a system compromise, where adversaries try to gather useful information about the target environment. By correlating the execution of this command with other suspicious activities, security analysts can better assess the potential for a security incident.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR to identify the user account associated with the execution of `systeminfo.exe`, determining whether it matches expected behavior.
  - Examine the command-line parameters used during the execution of `systeminfo` to ascertain if any additional flags or indicators were leveraged that might suggest malicious intent.
  - Correlate findings with user activity logs from the Proxy server to identify any external communications that occurred after the command was executed.
  - Analyze recent alerts from the SIEM that could indicate other reconnaissance or suspicious behavior around the same timeframe to provide context for the execution.

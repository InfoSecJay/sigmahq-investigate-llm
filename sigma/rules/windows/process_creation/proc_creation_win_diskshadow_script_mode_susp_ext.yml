  Detects execution of "Diskshadow.exe" in script mode to execute an script with a potentially uncommon extension.
  Initial baselining of the allowed extension list is required.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of "Diskshadow.exe" in script mode with uncommon script extensions. Diskshadow is a command-line tool included in Windows that is used to manage Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) snapshots and can be exploited by attackers to perform malicious actions such as evading defenses or extracting sensitive data. The rule focuses specifically on triggering alerts when the command line arguments include the '-s' flag (indicating script mode) and if the executed script file has an uncommon extension (in this case, it checks for '.txt' files). It leverages process creation logs as its primary data source, particularly by examining the `CommandLine` field to capture details about the execution context of Diskshadow. This activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of **Defense Evasion** (specifically technique T1218: Signed Binary Proxy Execution), highlighting the potential misuse of trusted processes by adversaries.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to identify instances of `diskshadow.exe` being executed with the `-s` flag and examine the command line for any suspicious extensions.
  - **Analyze Script Contents**: Investigate the script file that was executed for malicious commands or indicators of compromise (IOCs). Check the source and integrity of the script.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs**: Cross-reference the event with logs from Windows Security, Network Detection, or proxy logs to identify potential external communication or related suspicious activities.
  - **Check for Baseline Deviations**: Validate against the initial baseline of allowed script extensions within your organization to confirm whether the alerted extension is deemed suspicious.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule should be treated with medium priority due to the potential for compromise, especially in environments that utilize Diskshadow for legitimate administrative tasks. Prompt investigation is warranted as it could indicate an attempted evasion strategy by an adversary.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule operates under the assumption that the command-line interface and common scripting extensions are configured as intended within the enterprise. There may be areas where legitimate usage of uncommon extensions occurs, which could lead to false positives. Additionally, if an attacker employs methods to obfuscate or masquerade their command-line parameters or uses a common script extension that is whitelisted, the rule may fail to trigger. Analysts should be vigilant about potential evasion techniques that adversaries might employ to bypass detection.

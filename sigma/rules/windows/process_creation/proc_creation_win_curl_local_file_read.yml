  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Local File Read Using Curl.EXE" is designed to detect instances where the `curl.exe` command-line tool is used with the `file://` protocol handler to attempt to read local files on a Windows machine. This behavior can indicate potential information disclosure or data exfiltration attempts by adversaries who leverage trusted utilities like `curl` to manipulate files discreetly. The relevant technical data sources for this rule include process creation logs which capture executions of processes like `curl.exe`, as well as their associated command-line arguments. The detection pertains to the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (specifically the technique for command and scripting interpreter, T1059).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Logs:** Review your EDR solution for instances of `curl.exe` execution during the suspected timeframe, and confirm it was run with the command-line argument `file:///`.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command-line parameters used with `curl.exe`, specifically looking for any reference to local file paths which may indicate an attempt to read sensitive data.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check associated Windows event logs to understand what user executed the command and if this behavior aligns with normal user activity or patterns.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Utilize NDR or firewall logs to determine if there were any outbound network connections initiated after the execution of `curl.exe`, which may suggest a data exfiltration attempt.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with local file access, especially if sensitive information is revealed or compromised. Timely investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the command's purpose and the user's intentions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the attacker uses other methods to read local files that do not involve `curl.exe`, such as using PowerShell or other scripts. Additionally, legitimate uses of `curl` for file access may raise false positives, particularly in environments where `curl` is part of standard operations. The assumption is made that monitoring for `file:///` usage is comprehensive, but variations in command-line usage could lead to missed detections.

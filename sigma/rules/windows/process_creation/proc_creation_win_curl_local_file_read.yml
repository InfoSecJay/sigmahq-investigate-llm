  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potential misuse of `curl.exe`, a commonly used command-line tool for transferring data. Specifically, it looks for instances where `curl.exe` is executed with the `file:///` protocol, which implies that the tool is reading files from the local file system rather than making web requests. Such behavior may indicate an unauthorized attempt to access sensitive files or information within the system. The detection is based on process creation logs, focusing on two key aspects: the executable name, which must end with `curl.exe`, and the command line parameters that include the `file:///` protocol. This rule can help SOC teams identify potential data exfiltration attempts or other malicious activities involving local file access.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the process creation logs in the EDR to locate instances of `curl.exe` execution, specifically focusing on those accompanied by the `file:///` protocol in the command line.
  - Validate the context of the execution by checking the user account associated with the process to determine if it was run by a legitimate user or an unauthorized account.
  - Cross-reference the timestamps of the `curl.exe` executions with any other suspicious activities logged during the same timeframe, including unusual file access or modifications.
  - Consult network activity logs from the NGFW or Proxy to identify if there were any outbound connections initiated by the same user or system around the time of the detected execution.

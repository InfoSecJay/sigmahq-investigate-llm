  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Domain Trust Discovery Via Dsquery" is designed to detect the execution of the "dsquery.exe" command-line utility specifically for discovering domain trusts within an Active Directory (AD) environment. The rule identifies instances where this utility is invoked with command-line parameters that include 'trustedDomain', which suggests the user is attempting to enumerate existing trust relationships between domains. The primary data sources leveraged by this detection are process creation logs, which capture the execution of processes along with their command-line parameters. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Discovery" and specifically targets technique T1482, which relates to the discovery of trust relationships in Active Directory environments. 
  By monitoring for the execution of dsquery.exe, this rule helps in identifying potentially malicious reconnaissance activities that attackers may conduct to understand the domain's trust structure and exploit those relationships for lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in the SIEM to confirm the invocation of dsquery.exe, including the user account that executed the command and the timestamp of the activity.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters associated with the dsquery execution to determine if 'trustedDomain' was indeed used, indicating potential suspicious activity.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate the user account that performed the action through the EDR solution to identify other concurrent activities and confirm whether they match legitimate business operations.
  - **Audit Active Directory Trust Relationships:** Use AD tools to review current trust relationships for any unusual or unauthorized changes that may have been made around the same time as the alert.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for dsquery.exe execution to signify explicit reconnaissance activities, this alert is categorized as medium severity. In an enterprise environment, unauthorized use of such command-line utilities could indicate an ongoing attempt to gather information for later exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is important to note that this rule may not trigger if an adversary utilizes alternative methods for domain trust discovery, such as scripts or other command-line utilities that do not invoke dsquery.exe. Additionally, legitimate administrative users may run dsquery.exe for valid purposes, leading to false positives. There is an assumption that the enterprise environment has properly configured logging for process creation events; if these logs are not collected or if necessary permissions are lacking, the rule may fail to fire or capture relevant activity.

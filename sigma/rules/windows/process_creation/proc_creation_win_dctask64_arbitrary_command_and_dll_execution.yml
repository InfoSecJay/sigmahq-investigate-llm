  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "ManageEngine Endpoint Central Dctask64.EXE Potential Abuse" is designed to detect potentially malicious activities related to the execution of `dctask64.exe`, a legitimate signed binary from ZOHO Corporation utilized within ManageEngine Endpoint Central. Adversaries can exploit this binary for harmful purposes, such as DLL injection and the execution of arbitrary commands and processes. The rule primarily monitors for processes created with a specific path and hashes associated with known malicious abuse of `dctask64.exe`. In addition, it watches the command line parameters used during the execution of this binary, looking for specific keywords that indicate potential misuse, such as `executecmd64`, `invokeexe`, and `injectDll`. This detection is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055.001, which focuses on process injection methods and the evasion of defenses.
  To capture relevant events, the rule analyzes the Windows process creation logs, primarily leveraging telemetry data from Sysmon, which tracks process execution and command-line parameters associated with these actions. By correlating both the image path and specific command line arguments, this rule aims to identify scenarios where the intended use of `dctask64.exe` may have deviated into malicious behavior.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Execution Logs:** Utilize your EDR tool to search for instances of `dctask64.exe` being executed, paying close attention to the process hierarchy to determine the parent process context.
  - **Examine Command Line Arguments:** Inspect the command line parameters associated with the detected execution to identify any unusual or malicious commands that indicate an unauthorized activity.
  - **Analyze File Hashes:** Validate the file using the given IMPHASH values to confirm whether the executed binary is indeed the legitimate version or a potentially altered variant.
  - **Conduct Network Activity Review:** Check for any outgoing network connections initiated by the `dctask64.exe` process using firewall and network detection tools, which may indicate exfiltration attempts or command and control communications.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the risk posed by the potential abuse of a trusted binary for malicious purposes, which can result in significant impacts on system integrity and data security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the binary is executed without the targeted command line arguments or if alternative, less-obvious methods of execution are employed. Additionally, if an adversary employs a modified executable that does not match the specified Hashes or paths, the detection will fail. It is assumed that legitimate administrative use of `dctask64.exe` does not incorporate the flagged command line inputs; however, organizations must validate user roles and permissions to ensure proper usage.

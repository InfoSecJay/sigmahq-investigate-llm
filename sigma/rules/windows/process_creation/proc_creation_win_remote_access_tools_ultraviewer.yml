title: Remote Access Tool - UltraViewer Execution
id: 88656cec-6c3b-487c-82c0-f73ebb805503
status: test
description: |
  An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.
  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting the execution of UltraViewer—a legitimate remote access tool—focuses on monitoring process creation events in a Windows environment. Specifically, it looks for processes launched with specific attributes, particularly those related to UltraViewer, such as the product name, company name, and original file name. The technical data sources involved include Windows Security logs, specifically those capturing process creation events. This detection is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1219 (Remote Access Software), highlighting the potential use of such tools by adversaries to establish a command and control channel for remote interaction with compromised systems. In environments where remote access applications are common, this rule aims to pinpoint potentially malicious activity disguised as legitimate support when UltraViewer is executed.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Origin:** Review the process creation logs in the EDR tool to confirm the source of the UltraViewer executable. Check if the process was initiated from a known legitimate directory or if it has an anomalous path that raises suspicion.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate user activity associated with the timestamp of the alert. Cross-reference logs from the VPN, proxy, and any remote desktop access records to understand whether the user was performing legitimate remote support tasks.
  - **Assess Network Connections:** Utilize network logs from the NDR to evaluate any outbound connections initiated by the UltraViewer process. Pay attention to unusual destination IPs or URLs that may indicate command and control communication.
  - **Review System Changes:** Check for any concurrent registry changes or file modifications related to UltraViewer in the Windows system logs. This may reveal unauthorized alterations made by the adversary or the presence of additional payloads.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity as it indicates potential malicious use of remote access software that could facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive systems. If confirmed as malicious, such activity poses a significant risk requiring immediate investigation and mitigation measures.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if UltraViewer is used legitimately, leading to a high false positive rate in environments where the software is sanctioned for technical support. Additionally, if an adversary renames the executable or uses a different remote access tool, this detection may not trigger. It's also assumed that process creation logging is enabled and correctly configured in the environment, which may not always be the case.

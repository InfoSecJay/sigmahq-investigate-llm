  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential LethalHTA Technique Execution" aims to identify potentially malicious activity involving the execution of the `mshta.exe` process by a parent process of `svchost.exe`. The LethalHTA technique leverages Microsoft HTML Application (HTA) to execute malicious scripts that can evade traditional security measures. This rule detects such activity by monitoring process creation events on Windows systems, particularly focusing on the parental relationship between `mshta.exe`, an executable associated with HTML applications, and `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process responsible for hosting service processes. The rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218.005 under the tactic of Defense Evasion, as attackers often use such legitimate processes to mask malicious actions and avoid detection.
  The primary telemetry source for this detection includes process creation logs, which capture information about new processes initiated on the system, their parent processes, and command-line parameters. By examining these logs, the detection rule can identify instances where `mshta.exe` is spawned improperly by `svchost.exe`, indicating a potential security incident that warrants further investigation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs to trace the execution path of `mshta.exe` and confirm that it was indeed spawned by `svchost.exe`. Look for unusual timestamps or command-line arguments associated with the processes.
    
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Utilize EDR solutions to analyze the behavior of the `mshta.exe` process and check its associated network connections. Look for any connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains that may indicate command-and-control activity.
    
  - **Inspect Windows Event Logs:** Examine the Windows Security, System, and Application logs for any abnormal activities, including unexpected service actions or failures that correspond to the time of the detected activity. This may give additional context or insight into any potential system compromise.
    
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Use network detection tools to correlate any suspicious DNS queries or HTTP requests made by `mshta.exe`. Identifying unexpected outbound traffic can further indicate malicious behavior or data exfiltration attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity because the execution of `mshta.exe` spawned by a potentially compromised `svchost.exe` can indicate an active attempt to execute malicious scripts, posing a significant threat to the integrity and security of the affected environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the adversary manages to obfuscate the execution chain or uses legitimate processes that do not include `svchost.exe` as a parent. Additionally, if the system does not have `Process Creation` logging enabled or is misconfigured, the detection may also fail. It's assumed that the environment maintains adequate logging levels; therefore, appropriate setup is crucial for this detection rule to function effectively. Engineers must also consider that skilled adversaries may employ various techniques to evade detection, such as using different legitimate parent processes.

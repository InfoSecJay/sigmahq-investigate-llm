title: Potential Arbitrary File Download Via Cmdl32.EXE
id: f37aba28-a9e6-4045-882c-d5004043b337
status: test
description: |
  Detects execution of Cmdl32 with the "/vpn" and "/lan" flags.
  Attackers can abuse this utility in order to download arbitrary files via a configuration file.
  Inspect the location and the content of the file passed as an argument in order to determine if it is suspicious.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential misuse of the `Cmdl32.exe` executable, specifically when it is invoked with the `/vpn` and `/lan` flags. Command-line tools such as `Cmdl32.exe` can be exploited by attackers to download arbitrary files via configuration files, posing a significant security risk. The rule monitors process creation logs for instances of `Cmdl32.exe` with the key flags, leveraging data points such as the executable name and the command-line parameters provided. Itâ€™s crucial to inspect the source and content of any files referenced in these command-line executions to ascertain their legitimacy and uncover any malicious intent.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Utilize EDR tools to search for instances of `Cmdl32.exe` being executed with the specified command-line arguments, focusing on the timestamp of the alerts to correlate with user activity.
  - Review process creation logs to identify the parent process of `Cmdl32.exe` to determine if the execution was initiated by a legitimate application or an unauthorized script.
  - Analyze any downloaded files for signatures or characteristics indicative of malware using antivirus tools or sandbox environments.
  - Check network logs (from the NDR or proxy) for any outgoing connections made during the execution of `Cmdl32.exe`, which may provide context about potential data exfiltration attempts.

title: Potential Arbitrary File Download Via Cmdl32.EXE
id: f37aba28-a9e6-4045-882c-d5004043b337
status: test
description: |
  Detects execution of Cmdl32 with the "/vpn" and "/lan" flags.
  Attackers can abuse this utility in order to download arbitrary files via a configuration file.
  Inspect the location and the content of the file passed as an argument in order to determine if it is suspicious.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Arbitrary File Download Via Cmdl32.EXE" aims to detect the exploitation of the `cmdl32.exe` utility, a legitimate Windows component, which can be manipulated by attackers to download arbitrary files using specific command-line flags: `/vpn` and `/lan`. When executed with these flags, the utility may utilize configuration files sourced from potentially malicious locations, thus posing a security threat. The detection mechanism focuses on monitoring process creation logs and command-line arguments associated with the `cmdl32.exe` image. By identifying such patterns, the rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the Execution tactic (T1218) and Defense Evasion (T1202), highlighting the misuse of legitimate tools by adversaries.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR for instances of `cmdl32.exe` executing with the `/vpn` and `/lan` flags to confirm the alert details and understand the context of its execution.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters:** Capture and analyze the full command-line arguments used during the execution to identify any suspicious URLs or file paths that may indicate a potential threat.
  - **Inspect Downloaded Files:** If available, examine the contents of any configuration files or downloaded files referenced in the command line to assess their legitimacy and potential malware characteristics.
  - **Monitor Network Connections:** Utilize NDR tools to inspect any network connections initiated by `cmdl32.exe` to ascertain whether there are unusual external communications indicative of data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for an attacker to misuse built-in Windows functionality for malicious purposes. Organizations should treat this alert seriously, as it may indicate a pivot point for further compromise within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `cmdl32.exe` is executed without the specified command-line flags, or if it is obfuscated or executed through a technique that does not reliably log the necessary details in the system's event logs. Additionally, attackers may use alternate living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) or modified versions of legitimate executables to bypass detection. Analysts should remain aware of the potential for false positives, particularly in environments where legitimate use of `cmdl32.exe` is common.

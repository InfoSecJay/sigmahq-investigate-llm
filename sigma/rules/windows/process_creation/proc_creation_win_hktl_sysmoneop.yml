  ### Technical Context
  The "HackTool 
  - SysmonEOP Execution" detection rule focuses on identifying the execution of the SysmonEOP tool, which can be leveraged to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2022-41120) in the Sysmon logging service. This rule inspects the process creation events within a Windows environment to capture signs of this specific executable when it runs. The detection criteria are structured around two main indicators: the presence of the executable named `SysmonEOP.exe` and specific Import Hashes (IMPHASH values) associated with it. This monitoring falls under the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, specifically addressing the tactic of Privilege Escalation (T1068), which emphasizes routine escalations in access permissions that could lead to severe consequences within an enterprise.
  The technical data sources used in this detection rule are primarily Windows Sysmon logs, focusing on process creation events. By examining these logs, incident responders can accurately identify attempts to execute the SysmonEOP tool, enabling them to investigate potential exploitations of the Sysmon service.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Correlate Process Creation Logs:** Review recently generated process creation logs from Sysmon to identify instances of `SysmonEOP.exe` execution, along with associated command-line arguments and parent processes to understand the context of the execution.
  - **Analyze Hash Values:** Verify the presence of the specified Import Hashes (IMPHASH) in EDR logs for collected processes. This will help confirm whether the executed file aligns with the known malicious samples.
  - **Check for Privilege Escalation Attempts:** Use EDR solutions to analyze the context around the execution events for potential privilege escalation patterns, such as the alteration of security settings or creation of new user accounts.
  - **Review Firewall and Network Logs:** Inspect network connection logs and firewall logs to identify any suspicious outgoing connections that may relate to the execution of `SysmonEOP.exe`, potentially indicating command and control activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as critical due to the potential for privilege escalation resulting from the exploitation of a known vulnerability, which could jeopardize the integrity of system security and provide unauthorized access to systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot for this detection rule is that it may not trigger if the `SysmonEOP.exe` is renamed or modified to evade detection, as the rule relies heavily on specific filename and hash values. Additionally, if malicious actors employ stealth techniques or utilize other process injection methods, those actions may not be captured by this monitoring approach. Itâ€™s assumed that the monitored endpoints have appropriate telemetry configured and that the malicious executable is executed on a monitored system.

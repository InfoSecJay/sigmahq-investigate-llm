  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies suspicious child processes spawned by the "Manage Engine ServiceDesk Plus," which is a Java-based web service. The key focus of the rule is to monitor specific parent processes associated with the ServiceDesk application, particularly `java.exe`, and check for any launched executables that are commonly abused by attackers. These include tools such as `powershell.exe`, `bitsadmin.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and others, which can be leveraged for malicious activities, including command-and-control (C2) actions. The primary data source involved is the process creation logs that track the relationships between parent and child processes, providing insight into potentially unauthorized activity originating from this Java service. This rule is tied to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the tactics of Command and Control (T1102), reflecting the potential for adversaries to establish persistent connections to external servers during an attack.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Recent Process Activity**: Use your EDR solution to analyze the recent process activity on the affected systems for any instances of `AppVLP.exe`, `curl.exe`, or `powershell.exe` invoked by `java.exe` or other pointers related to the ManageEngine ServiceDesk.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments**: Investigate the command-line parameters for any suspicious child processes. Look for unusual flags or arguments, especially those involving the use of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` that include the keyword “stop,” which might indicate attempts to disable or manipulate services.
  - **Analyze Network Connections**: Examine any associated network connections to external hosts initiated by the processes detected. Look for established connections that may align with known attacker infrastructure or exhibit unusual patterns, indicating potential data exfiltration or remote access.
  - **Inspect Security and System Logs**: Cross-reference Windows Security and System Logs for any relevant entries that could correlate with the abnormal behavior of the Manage Engine ServiceDesk or its child processes. This can provide additional context or evidence of lateral movement in the environment.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is categorized as high in an enterprise environment due to the nature of the processes being scrutinized, which are frequently exploited by attackers. Any indication of these processes running under the ServiceDesk application warrants immediate investigation since it may involve a compromised service.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not activate in scenarios where the malicious process directly mimics or masquerades as the legitimate Manage Engine application, thus evading detection. Additionally, if attackers utilize less common tools or subprocesses not listed in the rule, they may avoid triggering alerts altogether. It is assumed that system configurations align with industry standards; any significant deviations may impact the rule’s effectiveness. Furthermore, legitimate subprocesses that may trigger false positives could cloud the investigation if not carefully distinguished from suspicious activities.

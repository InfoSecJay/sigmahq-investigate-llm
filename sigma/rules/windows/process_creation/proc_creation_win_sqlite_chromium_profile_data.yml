  ### Technical Context
  The "SQLite Chromium Profile Data DB Access" detection rule targets potential unauthorized access to sensitive data within Chromium-based browsers using the SQLite binary. Specifically, it identifies when processes are initiated using `sqlite.exe` or `sqlite3.exe` accompanied by command-line parameters that indicate the access of user profile databases, such as "Login Data," "Cookies," and "Web Data." The detection relies on monitoring process creation logs to correlate actions involving SQLite with the suspected target databases. This mapping is critical since attackers may exploit these binaries to extract sensitive user information stealthily. The manipulation of credentials and private data falls within the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of Credential Access (T1539) and Collection (T1005), guiding the detection of such malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze logs for instances of `sqlite.exe` or `sqlite3.exe` to confirm they were executed from expected paths without indication of malicious intent.
  - **Assess Command-Line Parameters:** Investigate the command-line arguments associated with the process to determine if there is any attempt to access sensitive data like Cookies or Login Data.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Look for abnormal user behavior or patterns in user activity that align with the timeline of the SQLite binary access to validate whether it was part of legitimate operations.
  - **Monitor For Lateral Movement:** Check related alerts or logs for signs of lateral movement that might further indicate adversarial behavior, particularly focusing on systems or users who interacted with the affected browser.
  ### Prioritization
  This rule is assigned a high severity level due to the potential risk of credential leakage and unauthorized data access, which can lead to significant security incidents if exploited in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Detection may fail if an adversary uses alternative methods or tools to access the Chromium databases without relying on the SQLite binaries, or if protective mechanisms obscure legitimate usage patterns. Additionally, there are assumptions that all instances of SQLite usage are correctly logged and that the necessary permissions for accurate logging are in place. The rule may also not trigger if commands are executed in environments where process creation events are not captured adequately.

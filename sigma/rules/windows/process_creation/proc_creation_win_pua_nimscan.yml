  Detects usage of NimScan, a portscanner utility.
  In early 2025, adversaries were observed using this utility to scan for open ports on remote hosts in a compromised environment.
  This rule identifies the execution of NimScan based on the process image name and specific hash values associated with different versions of the tool.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule “PUA 
  - NimScan Execution” aims to detect the execution of NimScan, a known port scanner utility that has been exploited by adversaries to probe for open ports on remote systems in compromised environments. By monitoring process creation events on Windows systems, the rule identifies instances where the binary `NimScan.exe` is executed. It specifically looks for certain hash values associated with different versions of NimScan to ensure accurate targeting of this potentially unwanted application. The detection leverages the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1046: Network Service Discovery**, which falls under the Discovery tactic. The key technical data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs, which detail the executed processes along with their image names and hash values.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the process creation logs in your EDR for the execution of `NimScan.exe` and correlate this with the corresponding hash values provided in the detection rule.
    
  - **Investigate Command Usage:** Review the command-line parameters associated with the `NimScan.exe` process to determine the specific actions being executed or to identify any unusual scanning activity.
  - **Check for Anomalous Network Activity:** Utilize your network connection logs to identify any unusual outbound connections initiated by the machine where NimScan was executed, particularly focused on scanning for open ports.
  - **Review User Activity Logs:** Analyze the logs of user accounts that initiated the NimScan processes to ensure that the activity aligns with legitimate administrative activities or to reveal any indicators of malicious intent.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts generated from this rule should be prioritized as medium severity. This is due to the potential for misuse of the NimScan tool by adversaries to gather reconnaissance information within an environment, making it a precursor to further malicious actions.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where NimScan is present but not executed, or if the software is executed from a path that does not match the defined image name. Additionally, legitimate administrative users could run NimScan for valid purposes, creating potential false positives. There is also the possibility that attackers may rename tools or utilize different evasion techniques to bypass detection, meaning the effectiveness of this rule can be limited if NimScan is disguised or altered before execution.

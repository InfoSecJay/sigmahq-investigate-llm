title: Uncommon Child Process Of Setres.EXE
id: 835e75bf-4bfd-47a4-b8a6-b766cac8bcb7
status: test
description: |
  Detects uncommon child process of Setres.EXE.
  Setres.EXE is a Windows server only process and tool that can be used to set the screen resolution.
  It can potentially be abused in order to launch any arbitrary file with a name containing the word "choice" from the current execution path.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect anomalous behavior associated with the Windows process `Setres.EXE`. The rule examines process creation events to identify any child processes spawned from `Setres.EXE` that contain "choice" in their filename, particularly monitoring for executions of `choice.exe` that are not originating from its legitimate locations (`C:\Windows\System32\choice.exe` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\choice.exe`). This rule targets the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), which outlines how adversaries may abuse legitimate binaries to execute malicious payloads, potentially evading detection. 
  The primary telemetry source for this detection is Windows Sysmon's process creation logs, which track detailed information about process generation and parent-child relationships, helping to identify suspicious execution patterns that could indicate misuse of legitimate software.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution**: Utilize EDR tools to trace the execution path of the detected child processes and verify the legitimacy of the parent `Setres.EXE`.
  - **Examine File Hashes**: Cross-reference the detected child process hashes against known good hashes in threat intelligence databases to check for malicious signatures.
  - **Check for Anomalies**: Investigate other child processes spawned around the same time or from unusual locations to identify potential lateral movement or additional risk indicators.
  - **Review Network Connections**: Analyze any outgoing network connections made by the suspicious child process using NDR logs to assess whether it communicates with known malicious domains or IPs.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is classified as high due to the potential for misuse of a legitimate Windows process to execute arbitrary code, which can indicate early stages of a compromise or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the attacker mimics legitimate execution paths or uses obfuscated command-line parameters that bypass the filter. The assumption is that `Setres.EXE` will typically operate in its designated environment; however, if legitimate actions by system administrators utilize unusual child processes, this could lead to false negatives or false positives. It's also important to acknowledge that this rule is based solely on the `process_creation` logs and may not account for other security events or advanced evasion techniques.

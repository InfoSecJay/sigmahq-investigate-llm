  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects suspicious PowerShell activity that utilizes obfuscation techniques, particularly through the use of UTF-16 and Base64 encoded strings in command lines. Obfuscated PowerShell commands are often employed by threat actors to evade detection and execute malicious scripts. The rule looks for specific patterns in the command line arguments of processes, such as encoded strings that are commonly associated with harmful PowerShell scripts. The primary data source involved in this detection is process creation logs from Windows, which provide insights into executed commands and their parameters. By uncovering these obfuscated commands, the rule helps organizations identify and respond to potential threats before they can cause damage.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Analyze the process creation logs in your EDR solution to identify instances of PowerShell running with suspicious command line arguments that match the detected patterns.
  - Cross-reference the identified PowerShell executions with AV logs to check for any known malicious signatures associated with the detected commands.
  - Investigate network traffic through NDR tools to see if any communications were initiated by the PowerShell process to external or suspicious IP addresses.
  - Utilize proxy logs to trace any web requests made by the PowerShell commands, identifying any potentially harmful downloads or connections.

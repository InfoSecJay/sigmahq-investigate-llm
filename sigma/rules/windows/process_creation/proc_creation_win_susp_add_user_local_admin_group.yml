  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "User Added to Local Administrators Group" is designed to detect instances where users are added to the local administrators group on Windows systems through command-line tools. This rule monitors both the execution of `net.exe` and PowerShell commands, specifically looking for the use of "localgroup" with the "/add" parameter or the "Add-LocalGroupMember" cmdlet, respectively. By analyzing the command-line arguments that indicate a user is added to the administrators group, this detection effectively monitors potentially unauthorized elevation of privileges which can be a precursor to further malicious activities. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Persistence tactic (T1098), as gaining administrative control is a common method for attackers to maintain a foothold in a compromised environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Process Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR to identify any processes that utilized `net.exe` or `powershell.exe` around the time of the alert. Pay special attention to command-line arguments that include "localgroup" and "Add-LocalGroupMember".
    
  - **Analyze User Account Changes:** Consult the local security event logs (Security logs) to verify any related security events (such as Event ID 4728) that correspond to the time when users were added to the local administrators group. 
  - **Validate User Authorization:** Cross-reference the newly added accounts against your organization's user access management policies to ensure they are authorized to have administrative privileges. Check for any atypical user behaviors or roles.
  - **Review Network Activities:** Investigate network logs for any suspicious or anomalous connections that might correlate with the timing of the command execution. Use tools such as NDR to determine if unexpected data was accessed or sent during that period.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risk associated with unauthorized privilege escalation. In an enterprise environment, unauthorized access to administrative groups can result in significant security breaches or data exfiltration if not addressed promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the command to add users is executed from scripts or via remote management tools that do not log command-line arguments effectively. Additionally, it assumes that the processes in question are executing on the monitored endpoints and that appropriate logging is enabled. Circumstances such as the deletion of logs or misuse of legitimate administrative tools can also defeat the detection capabilities of this rule, leading to missed alerts.

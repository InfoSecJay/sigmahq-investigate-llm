  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Audio Capture via SoundRecorder" is designed to detect instances where the Windows SoundRecorder application is used in a potentially malicious manner to capture audio recordings, which may indicate espionage or unauthorized information collection. The rule specifically looks for process creation events where the image being executed ends with `SoundRecorder.exe` and the command line includes the parameter `/FILE`, signaling that an audio file is being specified for output. This detection leverages Windows process creation logs as the primary data source, enabling the identification of potentially illicit activity based on known patterns used by attackers. 
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1123 (Audio Capture), which encompasses methods adversaries use to obtain audio recordings, exacerbating privacy and security concerns. Incident responders should recognize that while audio capture may serve legitimate purposes, its misuse poses significant risks to sensitive information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR/Process Logs:** Review the endpoint detection response (EDR) tool for historical data regarding `SoundRecorder.exe` execution, focusing on the user account and timestamps around the alert to determine if the activity is suspicious.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Confirm the command line used during the execution, particularly any `/FILE` parameters, to identify the target audio file and assess the intent behind the capture.
  - **Correlate User Activity:** Cross-reference the involved user account with other logs (e.g., authentication logs) to validate whether the user was performing expected activities at the time of the audio capture.
  - **Review Network Artifacts:** Inspect outbound traffic to find any connections to external locations that might correlate with audio recordings being sent or stored, which could indicate nefarious intentions.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a medium severity level as it identifies potentially invasive behavior, which can pose risks to personal privacy and organizational confidentiality. However, context must be assessed, as there may be legitimate reasons for audio capture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the attacker employs different methods to capture audio (e.g., using third-party tools or custom scripts). Additionally, if the processed command line does not include `/FILE`, legitimate usage could lead to false negatives. It's assumed that the SoundRecorder application is not heavily obfuscated or renamed by an adversary, which could inhibit detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential ShellDispatch.DLL Functionality Abuse" is designed to detect potential abuse of the "ShellDispatch.dll" through the invocation of arbitrary binaries using the ShellExecute function. It primarily focuses on two aspects of process creation: the detection of the Rundll32.exe process, which can be utilized to execute commands in an unintended manner, and the specific command-line parameter 'RunDll_ShellExecuteW', which indicates an attempt to invoke ShellExecute through the dynamic link library (DLL). 
  In a typical scenario, an attacker might use this kind of technique to execute malware or other undesired programs while trying to evade detection. Such behavior is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) and T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), as it leverages seemingly benign applications to carry out malicious tasks. The data sources involved in this detection include Windows process creation logs, which capture details about newly created processes (including their command lines) and attributes from the Sysmon logs relevant to process execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the EDR for any alerts associated with processes spawning from the Rundll32.exe executable, especially those involving unusual command-line parameters.
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Investigate Windows Event Logs related to process creation to identify any instances where Rundll32.exe was executed with command-line options that include 'RunDll_ShellExecuteW'.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Look at network traffic logs (NDR) to detect any outbound connections initiated by the suspicious process, which may indicate exfiltration or communication with a command and control server.
  - **Validate File Integrity:** Utilize AV and file integrity monitoring solutions to scan the environment for any unauthorized or altered files that may indicate compromise via the detected technique.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level assigned to this alert reflects the potential for serious security incidents, as attackers utilizing this technique can execute arbitrary code, compromising system integrity and data confidentiality within the enterprise. Quick investigation and response are recommended to mitigate any threats related to this behavior.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where traditional security controls are bypassed, such as if the attacker uses alternative execution methods not involving Rundll32.exe or uses tools that mimic benign commands. Additionally, environments heavily restricted by application whitelisting may not see this behavior as no execution will occur. Assumptions include that the presence of Sysmon logs is configured and that sufficient logging is enabled within the Windows environment to capture the necessary data points for this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious use of the Windows Installer executable, `msiexec.exe`. The rule identifies instances where `msiexec.exe` is invoked with a command line that includes web addresses. Attackers can leverage this method to download and execute malware hosted on remote servers under the guise of software installation, exploiting the legitimate capabilities of Windows Installer. The data sources involved in this detection include process creation logs that capture command-line parameters, specifically monitoring for the presence of both "msiexec" and "://". This correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for Defense Evasion (T1070) and Command and Control (T1105), as the use of web addresses may indicate an attempt to access external resources without raising immediate suspicion.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check Windows Security or Sysmon logs for all instances of `msiexec.exe`. Focus on command lines that contain web URLs and correlate timing with other suspicious activities.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Utilize EDR or NDR tools to review network connections made by the `msiexec.exe` process. Look for any outbound connections that align with known bad IP addresses or domains.
  - **Check Antivirus Logs:** Investigate any alerts from your AV system related to `msiexec.exe` during the time of the detection. This can provide additional context or confirm if any malicious payload was downloaded.
  - **Conduct a Threat Intelligence Lookup:** Cross-reference the domain or URL found in the command line against threat intelligence sources. Look for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the URLs.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium because the detection suggests a possible attempt to execute a malicious payload, a common tactic in cyber attacks. However, given that legitimate applications may also use `msiexec` to perform updates or installations, further investigation is essential to confirm malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses a different method to install software or masquerades malicious installations with legitimate software names. Additionally, it assumes that process creation logs are being adequately monitored and that an adversary is not using means to obfuscate command lines. False positives may also arise in environments where administrative tools or scripts utilize `msiexec` with web addresses for legitimate purposes.

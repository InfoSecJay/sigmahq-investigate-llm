title: Deleted Data Overwritten Via Cipher.EXE
id: 4b046706-5789-4673-b111-66f25fe99534
status: test
description: |
  Detects usage of the "cipher" built-in utility in order to overwrite deleted data from disk.
  Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources.
  Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Deleted Data Overwritten Via Cipher.EXE" is designed to detect the execution of the native Windows utility, `cipher.exe`, particularly when it is used with the `/w:` option to overwrite deleted data on disk. This utility is often employed by adversaries to permanently delete sensitive information by overwriting it, thereby making recovery nearly impossible. The rule collects data from process creation logs, looking specifically for the original file name of `cipher.exe` as well as instances where the command line includes the `/w:` flag, indicating that the utility is being used for data destruction purposes. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Impact," particularly under the technique T1485, which focuses on data destruction. By monitoring these activities, SOC analysts can better identify malicious actions aimed at ruining data integrity and availability.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Use EDR tools to analyze the process details of instances where `cipher.exe` was executed, including the user context and associated processes for any abnormal patterns.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line arguments for any unusual options or paths specified in the execution of `cipher.exe`, focusing on the `/w:` flag that indicates data overwriting.
  - **Examine Event Logs:** Query Windows Event Logs (Security, System, and Application) for events surrounding the execution to identify any correlating actions, such as file deletions or modifications occurring prior to the invocation of `cipher.exe`.
  - **Assess Network Activity:** Utilize NDR and Firewall logs to investigate network connections that might have been established in conjunction with the `cipher.exe` execution, which could indicate coordinated activity across the network.
  ### Prioritization
  When this alert fires, it signifies a potentially critical security incident, as the use of `cipher.exe` with the overwriting function indicates an active attempt to destroy data. Given the operational importance of data integrity, such actions could severely affect business continuity, warranting immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire if the adversary employs obfuscation techniques or alternative methods to invoke `cipher.exe` without the expected command-line parameters. Additionally, if `cipher.exe` is run by a privileged user during legitimate maintenance or compliance activities, its activity may generate false positives, making it crucial to contextually analyze each occurrence. Furthermore, the rule relies on the availability and retention of Windows process creation logs and may not trigger if log retention policies are insufficient or if logs have been tampered with.

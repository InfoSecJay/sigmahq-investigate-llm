  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule analyzes process creation events on Windows systems, specifically looking for processes initiated from the Task Manager (taskmgr.exe). Upon activation of taskmgr.exe, a user can launch other processes, which may serve various legitimate purposes or be exploited for malicious activities, such as bypassing User Account Control (UAC). The rule captures instances when a new process is created under the parent image of taskmgr.exe while filtering out commonly invoked executable files, such as Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe) or Resource Monitor (resmon.exe), to reduce false positives. This detection leverages Windows Security Event logs, primarily focusing on process creation logs, and is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the *Defense Evasion* tactic and specifically the *T1036: Masquerading* technique.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR tool to identify the details of the suspicious process, including the command-line arguments and the user account that initiated it.
  - **Examine Parent Processes:** Use Sysmon logs to investigate the parent process relationships, confirming whether taskmgr.exe was indeed used as the parent process and identifying any irregular process chain behaviors.
  - **Assess User Activity:** Analyze logs from Windows Event Viewer related to user activity around the time of the alert to establish whether legitimate administrative actions were performed that could justify the process creation.
  - **Network Connections Review:** Inspect any network connections established by the newly created process using firewall or network monitoring tools to determine if it exhibits suspicious or unauthorized communication patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is classified as low based on its association with potential administrative activities. However, it warrants investigation due to the possibility of circumvention techniques used by malicious actors to escalate privileges.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the taskmgr.exe process is manipulated or if an attacker utilizes other means to create processes without invoking taskmgr.exe. Additionally, legitimate users performing administrative tasks through task manager may result in false positives, as the rule may capture normal process behavior. It also assumes that process creation logs and filtering mechanisms are adequately monitored, and alternative methods of process creation (e.g., using scheduled tasks or scripts) are not covered by this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Recon Information for Export with Command Prompt" is designed to detect potential reconnaissance activities executed by adversaries who have established a foothold within a network. This rule specifically monitors for the use of command-line tools such as `tree.com`, `WMIC.exe`, `doskey.exe`, and `sc.exe`, which are frequently leveraged by attackers to extract and export internal information from a system. The rule focuses on identifying command invocations that redirect output to temporary files, indicating an attempt to collect and manipulate sensitive data. As part of the detection process, data sources involved include process creation logs to capture which executables were run and the command-line parameters that were used, as well as the context in which they were invoked (i.e., the parent process). This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1119 (Remote Access Tools) under the tactic of Collection, highlighting the malicious intent behind such actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR to examine process creation logs for any instances of the flagged executables (`tree.com`, `WMIC.exe`, etc.) and analyze their command-line arguments for suspicious activity.
  - **Analyze Parent Command Line:** Check the command line of the parent processes that invoked these tools to identify whether the output redirection patterns (`> %TEMP%\`) were present and connected to abnormal behavior.
  - **Check Network Activity:** Use NDR to monitor for any outgoing network connections that correspond with the timing of the detected command-line activities, as this may confirm data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Examine Temporary Files:** Investigate the contents of the temporary files to check whether any sensitive information has been collected and understand the scope of the potential compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for data exfiltration and system compromise through legitimate tools, which may escalate into significant security incidents if not investigated promptly.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  One limitation of this rule is that it may not fire in environments where logging is misconfigured or where Sysmon is not deployed, as critical process creation events might not be captured. Additionally, legitimate administrative use of these tools may create false positives, especially in environments where system administrators regularly utilize command-line utilities. Other evasion techniques, such as running these commands from scripts or manipulating process trees, could also prevent detection.

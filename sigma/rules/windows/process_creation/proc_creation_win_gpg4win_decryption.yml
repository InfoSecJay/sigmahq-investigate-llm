  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the usage of Gpg4win, specifically the command-line operations associated with file decryption. Utilizing Windows process creation logs, the rule looks for the execution of GnuPG's OpenPGP tool (gpg.exe or gpg2.exe) with command-line arguments indicating file decryption, such as `-d` and `passphrase`. When these elements are detected, it raises an alert suggesting a potentially malicious activity, as the use of Gpg4win can often indicate attempts to manipulate or access sensitive data covertly. This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework in the Execution tactic, particularly the technique of "Command-Line Interface" (T1059.003), which encompasses the execution of commands through various command-line interfaces.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the Windows Security Event Logs and EDR alerts for the execution of gpg.exe or gpg2.exe. Pay close attention to the timestamp and the user context in which these commands were initiated.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Assess the command-line parameters associated with the detected processes for sensitive information, specifically focusing on any usage of `passphrase` and the `-d` flag, which indicates decryption efforts.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize EDR and network logs to check if there were any outbound connections or unusual network patterns occurring around the same time as the Gpg4win usage that could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command and control server.
  - **Check for Related Artifacts:** Investigate file system changes or temporary files created in conjunction with the Gpg4win execution. Look for unusual files that may have been decrypted, as well as artifact cleanup efforts that might indicate an attempt to obscure malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity as it suggests potentially suspicious activity that could indicate data manipulation or exfiltration efforts by an adversary. Quick investigation is warranted to ascertain whether the action is part of legitimate operations or indicative of a security incident.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not trigger if the adversary uses alternative methods or tools for file decryption that do not invoke gpg.exe or gpg2.exe. Additionally, the rule operates under the assumption that command line logging is enabled and capturing arguments, which is not always the case in all environments. Furthermore, adversaries may use tactics such as process hollowing or DLL injection to circumvent detection, making it crucial to consider a wider context when analyzing alerts.

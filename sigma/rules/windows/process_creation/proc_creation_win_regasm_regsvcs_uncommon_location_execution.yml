  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to identify potential misuse of the `Regasm.exe` and `Regsvcs.exe` utilities, which are typically used for registering and configuring .NET framework assemblies for COM interop. When executed from uncommon directories like `AppData\Local\Temp` or `Users\Public`, these utilities may signal suspicious behavior often associated with nefarious activities such as malware persistence or lateral movement within a network. The detection relies on various data sources, particularly process creation logs, which capture details such as the command line and image file paths of executed processes. By focusing on command line execution from untrusted directories, the rule leverages the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically addressing the `Defense Evasion` tactic (T1218.009).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Execution Context:** Check the process creation logs in the EDR for additional context regarding the user account that executed the suspicious command and the time of execution. Identify if the user has a legitimate reason to run these utilities.
  - **Assess Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command-line parameters associated with the executed processes within the EDR to determine if any unusual flags or configurations were used that deviate from standard operational procedures.
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Review associated Windows Event Logs, particularly those from the Security, System, and Application logs, to identify any abnormal behavior or events occurring before or after the execution of `Regasm` or `Regsvcs`.
  - **Inspect Network Activity:** Utilize NDR and proxy logs to trace any network connections initiated by the executing process. Investigate communications with external IP addresses or domains that are suspicious or known for malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for lateral movement and persistence in an environment, suggesting that immediate investigation is warranted to mitigate risks posed by unauthorized use of system utilities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the monitored directories are indicative of suspicious activity; however, legitimate processes can also execute from these locations. Additionally, the rule may not trigger in environments where execution policies and user behaviors conform to expected norms, or if the attack vector circumvents these detection points (e.g., using legitimate tools for malicious purposes). It may also be bypassed if an attacker employs obfuscation techniques or executes from alternative locations not covered by the rule.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule targets suspicious downloads initiated via the Bitsadmin tool, specifically when the source is a direct IP address rather than a domain name. Bitsadmin is a command-line tool widely used to create and manage asynchronous file transfers. The rule examines processes launched with Bitsadmin, focusing on command-line parameters that indicate file transfer activities such as `/transfer`, `/create`, and `/addfile`, and searches for URLs containing IP addresses. The technical data sources involved include process creation logs that capture Bitadmin's execution, including command-line arguments and parent processes. This behavior is associated with several MITRE ATT&CK techniques, including **T1197** (Bait and Switch), **T1036.003** (Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location), and falls under the broader tactics of **Defense Evasion** and **Persistence**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Review process creation logs for instances of Bitsadmin invoking the relevant commands with direct IP addresses, including `CommandLine` and `ParentCommandLine` for additional context.
    
  - **Investigate Network Connections**: Use your network detection and response (NDR) tools to identify any outbound connections initiated by the IP address specified in the Bitsadmin command, which may reveal malicious activity or exfiltration attempts.
    
  - **Analyze Endpoint Threats**: Leverage endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to scan for any indicators of compromise related to the execution of Bitsadmin, including correlating with historical logs or alerts for unusual file downloads.
    
  - **Review Security Alerts**: Check for any alerts in other security tools (e.g., antivirus, firewall, proxy) that may provide insight into suspicious traffic or blocked IPs during the timeframe of the Bitsadmin execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity because the use of direct IP addresses to download files can indicate attempts to bypass DNS filtering, commonly used in malicious operations. Prompt investigation is essential to mitigate potential threats or data breaches.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not capture scenarios where Bitsadmin is executed with legitimate domain names, as the focus is exclusively on direct IP address usage. There is also the potential for false positives stemming from benign usage of Bitsadmin for legitimate file transfers in controlled environments. Moreover, adversaries may employ other means of file retrieval or disguise their activity through encrypted channels, evading detection by this rule.

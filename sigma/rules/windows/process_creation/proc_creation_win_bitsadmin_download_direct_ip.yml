  ### Technical Context
  This rule detects suspicious activity involving the Windows utility `bitsadmin.exe`, which is often used to create and manage download tasks without user intervention. Specifically, the rule targets command-line executions of `bitsadmin.exe` that initiate transfers using URLs that contain an IP address, which can indicate potential misuse or malicious downloads rather than standard DNS-based resolutions. The primary data sources utilized for this detection include process creation logs that capture details such as the command-line arguments used to invoke the process, allowing the rule to identify certain patterns of behavior associated with deceptive or unauthorized file downloads.
  By assessing indicators such as the specific command-line flags (e.g., `/transfer`, `/create`, `/addfile`) alongside checks that ensure the URL format matches patterns typically involving direct IP addresses, the rule aims to flag suspicious downloads. This information provides incident responders with actionable insights on potential threats leveraging `bitsadmin` to bypass typical security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Examine the EDR process creation logs for entries related to `bitsadmin.exe`, focusing on the captured command-line arguments to identify the nature of the download being executed.
  - Cross-reference any flagged IP addresses against threat intelligence sources to determine if they are known malicious or associated with suspicious activities.
  - Review network traffic through the NDR to identify data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized connections originating from the affected endpoint during the time of the `bitsadmin` execution.
  - Utilize cloud console logs from environments like AWS, GCP, or Azure to analyze any related file uploads or API interactions that may correlate with the suspicious downloads initiated by `bitsadmin.exe`.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Remote Access Tool 
  - ScreenConnect Remote Command Execution" is designed to detect potentially malicious activity related to the execution of system commands via the ScreenConnect Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) service. The rule specifically targets processes initiated by the ScreenConnect service (identified through the `ParentImage` field) that spawn instances of `cmd.exe`. It does this by correlating the parent-child relationship between the ScreenConnect Client Service and `cmd.exe`, while also examining the command-line arguments to identify executions from temporary ScreenConnect directories.
  The logging sources utilized for this detection rely on Windows Process Creation logs, specifically monitoring the process creation events that provide insights into which parent process spawned children. The MITRE ATT&CK framework tactic associated with this rule is "Execution" and the technique is categorized under T1059.003, which refers to native Windows command shell execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Events:** Using an EDR tool, query for any process creation events involving `cmd.exe` with a parent process of `ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe`. Look for command-line arguments that reference the ScreenConnect temporary directory.
    
  - **Analyze Related Network Connections:** Investigate any network connections established by the identified `cmd.exe` processes. Use NDR tools to see if any suspicious external connections correlate with the command execution.
    
  - **Examine AV Logs for Alerts:** Check AV logs for any detections or alerts triggered during the timeframe of the command execution. Itâ€™s necessary to confirm whether the executed command interacted with known malicious URLs or file hashes.
    
  - **Consult Windows Event Logs:** Inspect relevant Windows Security and System event logs for abnormal behavior, focusing on logons or account activities associated with the ScreenConnect service during the execution time frame.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is classified as low; however, it could indicate illicit use of remote access tools if not mitigated properly. Given the potential for legitimate administrative use of ScreenConnect, analysts should proceed with caution and gather sufficient context before escalating.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not trigger if an adversary utilizes methods to disguise command execution or if commands are executed outside of the structured methodology outlined by the rule. Additionally, environments with heavy legitimate use of ScreenConnect may produce numerous false positives, which could lead to alert fatigue. It is crucial to ensure that the rule does not fire during standard operational use cases, and engineers should validate that system logs are properly configured to capture all necessary process creation events.

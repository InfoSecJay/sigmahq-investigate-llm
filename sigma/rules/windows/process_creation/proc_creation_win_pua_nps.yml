  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - NPS Tunneling Tool Execution" aims to detect the execution of the NPS (Network Proxy Service) tunneling tool, which is utilized for port forwarding and acting as a penetration proxy server. This rule focuses on monitoring the process creation events within Windows environments specifically targeting the executable file `npc.exe`. It analyzes command-line parameters to identify potential malicious activity by detecting specific flags associated with the tool, such as `-server=`, `-vkey=`, and `-password=`, along with configurations that reference `-config=npc`. The rule also incorporates a check for specific file hashes associated with known versions of the NPS tool, enhancing detection capabilities against its usage. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic here is "Command and Control" (T1090), which refers to methods that adversaries employ to establish a foothold in a target network and maintain control over it.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to investigate the process creation logs for `npc.exe` execution, noting the date, time, and origin of the execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Check the command-line arguments for the process to identify potentially malicious flags or configurations that may indicate an unauthorized use of NPS.
  - **Check for Network Connections:** Investigate network event logs for any unusual outbound connections associated with the `npc.exe` process to identify if it is being used to tunnel data.
  - **Examine Historical Hash Values:** Validate the file hashes against known malicious or legitimate signatures in your AV tools and threat intelligence databases to determine the context of the file's presence.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is tagged with a high severity level due to the risk posed by the unauthorized use of tunneling tools, which can signify a potential breach or compromise of network security, allowing attackers to establish covert communication channels.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the NPS tunneling tool is executed without the specified command-line arguments or if a custom version of the application with different hashes is utilized. Additionally, false negatives may occur if the attacker modifies the file name or obscures its execution context. Analysts should also consider legitimate administrative use cases that may trigger the alert, particularly in environments where NPS tools are employed for internal purposes.

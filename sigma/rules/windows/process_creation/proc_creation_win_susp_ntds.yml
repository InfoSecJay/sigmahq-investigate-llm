  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious processes associated with the exfiltration of the NTDS.DIT file, which is a critical Active Directory database containing user account information and passwords. The detection criteria focus on command-line patterns and specific executable names such as `NTDSDump.exe` and `NTDSDumpEx.exe`, which are commonly used to access and export NTDS.DIT data. Key indicators include command-line arguments that specify the database file (`ntds.dit`) and system hive files (`system.hiv`), along with various suspicious PowerShell commands that may be aimed at retrieving this sensitive data. The rule leverages data from Windows process creation logs to identify potentially malicious activities, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Credential Access (T1003.003).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Windows Security event logs for entries corresponding to the identified processes (`NTDSDump.exe`, `NTDSDumpEx.exe`) and analyze their command-line arguments for any unusual parameters.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Use your EDR tools to investigate the endpoint where the alert was triggered, looking for additional suspicious behaviors such as lateral movement or process injection that may indicate a larger compromise.
  - **Inspect PowerShell Activity:** Investigate PowerShell logs to check for the execution of commands like `ntdsutil` and `NTDSgrab.ps1`, focusing on the contexts they were run to determine if they were part of malicious activity.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Evaluate network logs from the NDR and Firewall logs for any outbound connections that correspond with the timing of the suspicious process to identify potential data exfiltration activities.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the sensitivity of NTDS.DIT and its role in Active Directory, alerts triggered by this detection rule should be considered high priority. Compromise of this data can lead to significant security breaches, unauthorized access, or privilege escalation within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where the attackers utilize modified or renamed versions of the flagged tools, or if they employ other techniques to obfuscate their activities, such as custom scripts that don't use recognized command-line parameters. Additionally, the effectiveness of this detection is dependent on proper Sysmon logging configurations being in place, which could vary across different environments. There is also an assumption that all potentially malicious user actions are logged; if event logging is misconfigured, activity may be omitted.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "System Network Connections Discovery Via Net.EXE" is designed to detect potential reconnaissance activities by adversaries attempting to gather information about network connections on a compromised Windows system. It focuses specifically on the use of the `net.exe` and `net1.exe` commands, which are standard Windows tools that allow users to manage network resources, including viewing active network connections. The detection looks for process creation events related to `net.exe` or `net1.exe` and the presence of specific command-line parameters indicating network queries, such as “use” or “sessions”. 
  This rule is tagged under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1049 ("System Network Connections Discovery"), which is categorized as a discovery tactic. The relevance of this detection lies in its ability to identify when an attacker may be attempting to explore the network landscape, helping defenders proactively identify potential lateral movement or further exploitation attempts within their environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR to examine the process creation logs for instances of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` and assess the command-line arguments used during execution to confirm if they match the detected patterns.
  - **Analyze System Logs:** Check Windows Security logs to identify any unusual login events or remote access instances occurring around the same time as the detection to correlate unauthorized use of network discovery commands.
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Utilize NDR solutions to analyze network traffic patterns for unusual connections or attempts to access sensitive network resources initiated from the detected command, focusing on potential lateral movement.
  - **Examine Historical Data:** Query application logs such as Sysmon or Windows Event Logs to investigate any previous instances of similar command executions to identify patterns or recurring behavior that may indicate persistence.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is labeled with a low severity level, indicating that while the execution of network discovery commands can represent reconnaissance activity, it may not always denote malicious intent, especially if performed by legitimate administrative users. However, in critical environments or when correlated with other suspicious activities, it should still be treated with caution.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where `net.exe` is not commonly used or where security policies limit its execution. Furthermore, if adversaries utilize context-aware scripts or invoke this functionality via other tools, such as PowerShell, the detection may not fire. There’s an assumption that network discovery tools will be used in a standard manner; however, attackers may obfuscate their actions or use alternate methodologies to evade detection.

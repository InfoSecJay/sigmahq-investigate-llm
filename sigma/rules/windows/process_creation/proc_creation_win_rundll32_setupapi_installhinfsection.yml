title: Suspicious Rundll32 Setupapi.dll Activity
id: 285b85b1-a555-4095-8652-a8a4106af63f
status: test
description: setupapi.dll library provide InstallHinfSection function for processing
  INF files. INF file may contain instructions allowing to create values in the registry,
  modify files and install drivers. This technique could be used to obtain persistence
  via modifying one of Run or RunOnce registry keys, run process or use other DLLs
  chain calls (see references) InstallHinfSection function in setupapi.dll calls runonce.exe
  executable regardless of actual content of INF file.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious use of the `setupapi.dll` library, which is commonly exploited for persisting malware on Windows systems. The rule specifically looks for instances where the `rundll32.exe` process invokes the `InstallHinfSection` function from `setupapi.dll` to execute `runonce.exe`. This behavior can indicate an attempt to modify registry keys related to system startup—such as the Run or RunOnce keys—allowing attackers to establish persistence covertly. By analyzing process creation logs, particularly those that show command-line arguments and parent-child relationships between processes, the rule identifies suspicious activity that deviates from normal administrative and operational tasks.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Investigate the alert by reviewing the command-line parameters associated with the detected `runonce.exe` process in the EDR tool to determine if any malicious INF file was executed.
  - Examine the parent process details for `rundll32.exe` within the EDR logs, particularly focusing on the command line to confirm it includes `setupapi.dll` and `InstallHinfSection`.
  - Check the system's registry for any alterations made to the Run or RunOnce keys that correspond with the timing of the alert, using registry inspection tools.
  - Review recently executed processes and their relationships using the SIEM to identify any other sibling processes or related activities that could indicate a broader attack or persistence mechanism.

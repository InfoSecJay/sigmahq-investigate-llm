id: 285b85b1-a555-4095-8652-a8a4106af63f
status: test
description: setupapi.dll library provide InstallHinfSection function for processing
  INF files. INF file may contain instructions allowing to create values in the registry,
  modify files and install drivers. This technique could be used to obtain persistence
  via modifying one of Run or RunOnce registry keys, run process or use other DLLs
  chain calls (see references) InstallHinfSection function in setupapi.dll calls runonce.exe
  executable regardless of actual content of INF file.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Rundll32 Setupapi.dll Activity" Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially malicious use of the `rundll32.exe` process, specifically when it invokes the `InstallHinfSection` function from the `setupapi.dll` library. This function is commonly utilized to process INF files, which can contain instructions to modify the Windows registry, install drivers, and execute other processes. Adversaries may exploit this functionality to achieve persistence by modifying registry keys, such as those under the 'Run' or 'RunOnce' paths, so that malicious programs can execute at startup. The rule captures instances where `rundll32.exe` is the parent process, and its command line indicates a call to `setupapi.dll` along with the `InstallHinfSection` keyword.
  This detection leverages event logs related to process creation on Windows systems, specifically focusing on the command-line arguments of processes. The corresponding MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique for this behavior fall under **Defense Evasion** and specifically relate to **T1218.011** (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: rundll32). While legitimate administrative actions may utilize this functionality legitimately, the specific conditions set forth in this rule help flag potential misuse indicative of an attack.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine EDR Alerts:** Use your EDR platform to investigate alerts related to `rundll32.exe` and identify other associated processes or anomalies in execution patterns that might indicate malicious behavior.
  - **Review Process Logs:** Utilize Windows Security Logs to examine the command line used during the execution of `rundll32.exe`. Determine if the command parameters align with known good practices or appear unusual or unexpected.
  - **Analyze Registry Changes:** Check the Windows registry for modifications that may have occurred in the `Run` or `RunOnce` keys around the same time as the alert. Identify any new or unfamiliar entries that could suggest persistence mechanisms.
  - **Assess File Integrity:** Investigate any files that may have been modified or created during the execution of the detected activity using logs from your antivirus and endpoint security solutions to ensure they are not part of an infection.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has a medium severity level due to the potential for abuse in gaining persistence. While it could also arise from legitimate administrative activities, its association with known malicious behaviors necessitates a closer investigation to rule out any threats.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - The rule may not fire if the command-line arguments are obfuscated or altered significantly by the attacker, as the conditions are specific to the identifiers used in the command line. 
  - Legitimate applications using `setupapi.dll` may trigger false positives, which must be evaluated against the specific context of their execution.
  - Adversaries may choose to use alternative methods of persistence that do not involve `rundll32.exe`, such as direct code execution or less scrutinized mechanisms, reducing the likelihood of coverage by this rule.

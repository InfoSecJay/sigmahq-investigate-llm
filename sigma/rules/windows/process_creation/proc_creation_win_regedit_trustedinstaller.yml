  ### Technical Context
  The "Regedit as Trusted Installer" detection rule monitors for the execution of the Windows Registry Editor (regedit.exe) when it is initiated by the TrustedInstaller.exe or ProcessHacker.exe, both of which can signify unauthorized privilege escalation attempts. The primary focus is on the process creation logs, specifically identifying instances where regedit.exe is launched with elevated privileges typically associated with system-level access. This behavior is alarming as it may indicate malicious actors trying to manipulate system registries for their benefit, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1548 (Privilege Escalation). By capturing this information, security teams can detect and respond to potentially severe threats taking advantage of system trust relationships and capabilities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Process Origin**: Leverage your EDR solution to trace the origin of the process tree leading to the invocation of regedit.exe. Look for any suspicious activity or anomalous behavior in the parent process (TrustedInstaller.exe or ProcessHacker.exe).
    
  - **Examine Command-Line Parameters**: Check the command-line parameters used during the execution of regedit.exe to see if any unwanted or unusual arguments were utilized that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Review Associated Events**: Investigate Windows Event Logs, focusing on security events related to process creation and any recent changes made to the registry that coincide with the alert timeframe.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence**: Utilize your threat intelligence feeds to determine if the detection aligns with known patterns of behavior for advanced persistent threats (APTs) or recent vulnerabilities associated with the processes identified.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert carries a high severity level due to the significant risk posed by unauthorized privilege escalation attempts, which can lead to broader system compromises and data breaches within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in situations where an adversary uses different methods to escalate privileges or if alternative registry editing tools that do not match the specified process names are employed. Additionally, it assumes that process monitoring is adequately capturing process creation events without interference from anti-malware or system configurations that might suppress such alerts. Notably, valid system administrators may legitimately invoke regedit.exe under TrustedInstaller, resulting in potential false positives.

  Threat actors can use auditpol binary to change audit policy configuration to impair detection capability.
  This can be carried out by selectively disabling/removing certain audit policies as well as restoring a custom policy owned by the threat actor.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential tampering with an organization's audit policies through the use of the `auditpol.exe` binary. Threat actors may utilize this tool to alter audit policies to reduce the visibility of their actions and evade detection mechanisms. The rule specifically looks for processes that invoke `auditpol.exe` with command-line parameters that indicate a change or removal of existing audit settings, such as `disable`, `clear`, `remove`, and `restore`. The log source for this detection is based on Windows process creation logs, which capture information about executed processes, their parameters, and associated original file details. By monitoring these events, analysts can identify when an actor is attempting to conceal their activities by manipulating audit settings, aligning this detection with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of "Defense Evasion" and the technique "T1562.002".
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Examine the Windows process creation logs in the SIEM for instances of `auditpol.exe` along with the associated command-line arguments to confirm suspicious activity.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Utilize EDR tools to assess the behavior of the host where the `auditpol.exe` process was involved. Look for signs of unusual process behavior or any additional indicators of compromise.
  - **Analyze Audit Policy Changes:** Check the current audit policy settings against the expected organizational settings to determine if any policies were disabled or removed inappropriately.
  - **Assess Historical Changes:** Investigate historical event logs for changes to audit policies before the detection was triggered. This can provide context on whether the changes were legitimate or part of an adversarial action.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level for this alert is attributed to the critical role audit policies play in monitoring and detecting malicious activities. Unauthorized modifications to these settings could severely compromise the organization's detection capabilities, potentially allowing attackers to operate undetected.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that all instances of `auditpol.exe` executions are logged accurately in process creation logs. However, it may not fire in environments where logging is disabled or insufficient. Additionally, if an attacker uses alternative methods to change audit settings or employs a different binary, the rule would fail to detect such activities. Itâ€™s important for detection engineers to ensure an effective logging policy is in place and to monitor for similar suspicious behavior across other processes or scripts.

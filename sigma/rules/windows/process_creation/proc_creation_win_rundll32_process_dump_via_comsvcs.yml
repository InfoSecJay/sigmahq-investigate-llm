  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activity related to process memory dumps initiated via the `comsvcs.dll` library using `rundll32.exe`. The rule leverages various command-line parameters indicative of memory dumping techniques, specifically looking for calls to `MiniDump` and other related components in the command line. The rule inspects processes spawned with `rundll32.exe` to spot behaviors aligned with credential access and defense evasion tactics, specifically mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1036 (Masquerading) and T1003.001 (Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory). By monitoring Windows process creation logs, the rule efficiently identifies when an adversary may attempt to leverage memory dumps to extract sensitive information, which is crucial for maintaining security posture in enterprise environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Examine alerts in the EDR for the identified process, particularly focusing on `rundll32.exe` instances. Check the associated command-line arguments for any anomalous patterns or the presence of the `comsvcs` parameter.
  - **Analyze System Logs:** Inspect Windows Security and System logs for any recent related process creation events and errors that could indicate misconfigurations or abnormal activity linked to the monitored process.
  - **Check Network Connections:** Utilize the NDR tools to track any outbound connections initiated by the `rundll32.exe` process. Monitor these connections for potential data exfiltration attempts or command-and-control behavior.
  - **Query AV Logs:** Cross-reference alert details with your AV logs to verify if the detected behavior triggered any security rules. Investigate if the alerts have corresponding blocks or had been quarantined.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is high due to the critical nature of memory dumps in facilitating credential harvesting. Since malicious actors often exploit such techniques to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, immediate investigation is necessary to avoid potential data breaches or credential leaks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if the attacker utilizes alternative means to initiate memory dumps that do not involve `rundll32.exe` or `comsvcs.dll`, or if they employ obfuscation techniques in command-line arguments. Additionally, if the telemetry from process creation is limited or lacks detailed logging, the rule may not capture potential violations. It is assumed that defenders have visibility into the necessary log sources and configurations surrounding Sysmon or Windows logs are effective and intact to avoid evasion tactics.

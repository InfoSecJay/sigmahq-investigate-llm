  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Uncommon Child Process Of DefaultPack.EXE" targets potential suspicious activities involving the "DefaultPack.EXE" binary, which is often exploited by adversaries to launch malicious child processes in a stealthy manner. This rule detects uncommon child processes spawned from "DefaultPack.EXE" by analyzing process creation logs to identify the parent-child relationship. In essence, when "DefaultPack.EXE" starts, the rule checks the subsequent child processes to see if they deviate from expected behavior, which may indicate a misuse of that binary for executing unauthorized applications. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically reflecting the techniques associated with Execution (T1218) and Defense Evasion.
  The primary data source for this rule is the Windows process creation logs, which capture vital details such as the command line arguments and the relationships between parent and child processes. Monitoring these logs allows incident responders to identify potentially malicious activity propagating from an abused legitimate process, thus enhancing overall alerting capabilities regarding advanced threats that leverage known binaries for nefarious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs within the EDR for instances of "DefaultPack.EXE" launching uncommon child processes. Analyze the command-line arguments of these child processes to identify potentially malicious activities.
    
  - **Correlate with Other Data Sources:** Utilize the SIEM to correlate alerts from multiple sources, such as network connections and telemetry data, to determine if related suspicious activities have occurred, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - **Review Security Event Logs:** Examine Windows Security logs for any associated events that may indicate privilege escalations or unusual access patterns by the processes spawned from "DefaultPack.EXE."
  - **Assess File Integrity:** Use tools to check the integrity of the binaries associated with the child processes to verify if they have been modified or if suspicious files have been created in conjunction with their execution.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is categorized as medium because the detection of unusual child processes spawned from a commonly seen binary like "DefaultPack.EXE" may indicate an advanced exploitation technique. Such cases warrant immediate investigation, given that they can involve evasion tactics often used by sophisticated threat actors.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  One significant blind spot for this rule is the possibility of legitimate applications using "DefaultPack.EXE" for benign purposes, which could lead to false positives. Furthermore, if an adversary employs name obfuscation or encrypts the payloads of the child processes, it may evade detection as well. It is also assumed that the environment has not been altered to prevent logging or that security auditing measures are in place to collect relevant telemetry data effectively. Other factors that could impede the rule's effectiveness include improper configuration of logging settings or rare usage contexts that do not trigger the rule.

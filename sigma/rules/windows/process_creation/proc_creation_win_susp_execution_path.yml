  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potentially suspicious process executions originating from uncommon Windows folders that are considered atypical for legitimate activity. By monitoring process creation events, the rule focuses on paths associated with system-level operations, user profiles that typically should not contain executables, and temporary storage locations such as `C:\Users\Default\`, `:\Windows\addins\`, and others mentioned in the rule. The logic behind this rule is grounded in the principle that malicious actors often execute payloads from non-standard directories to evade detection. 
  The relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique that this rule addresses is **T1036** ("Masquerading"), particularly in the context of defense evasion tactics. When a process is launched from an unexpected folder, it raises a flag for further investigation, as it may indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activity using everyday Windows paths, thus bypassing standard security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Examine the process details in the EDR tool to ascertain whether the executable is legitimate or suspicious. Validate the process name, path, and origin of the binary to rule out false positives.
  - **Examine Parent Processes:** Investigate the parent processes of the detected suspicious execution to determine if they have a legitimate context or if they lead back to known malicious activity. This may provide insights into how the process was initiated.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Review Windows Event Logs for user authentication events around the time of the process execution to understand if unauthorized or anomalous access occurred. This can help contextualize the alert within user behavior.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Use NDR tools to analyze any outbound network connections initiated by the suspicious process. Look for command and control (C2) patterns or unusual data exfiltration activities that could indicate a security breach.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the high likelihood that execution from uncommon folders represents a method used by attackers to evade detection. Processes initiated from these locations may authorize malicious actions that compromise system security, making timely investigation critical.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if attackers execute their payloads from commonly used or legitimate directories that are not monitored, or if they manipulate the process environment to obscure their actions. Moreover, the rule assumes that the telemetry is properly configured to capture process creation events across all relevant Windows systems, which may not always be the case in decentralized or unmonitored environments. Further, unknown false positives may arise due to legitimate applications utilizing these folders for storage, thus necessitating ongoing tuning and validation against legitimate software behaviors.

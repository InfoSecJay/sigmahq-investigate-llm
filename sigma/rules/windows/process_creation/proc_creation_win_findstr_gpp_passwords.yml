  ### Technical Context
  The "Findstr GPP Passwords" detection rule identifies potential attempts to extract sensitive credentials stored in Group Policy Preferences (GPP) on Windows Domain Controllers. Specifically, it looks for the execution of the `find.exe` or `findstr.exe` commands, particularly when the command line contains the keyword `cpassword`, indicating that a decryption attempt may be underway. The presence of `\sysvol\` and `.xml` in the command line suggests that the attacker is targeting the specific XML files hosted in the SYSVOL directory, where GPP files often reside. These files may contain encrypted passwords, which can be decrypted with tools like `gpp-decrypt`. The rule utilizes process creation logs to track these potentially malicious command-line activities in real-time, providing a high-level alert for analysts.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Check your EDR for recent process creation events involving `find.exe` or `findstr.exe` to find any instances where these commands were executed with `cpassword` in the command line.
  - Review the logs from the Domain Controller to locate the specific command execution time and the user account that initiated the command.
  - Cross-reference with Active Directory logs to verify if the user has any elevated permissions that could suggest malicious intent or legitimate administrative access.
  - Investigate the SYSVOL directory contents to ensure no unauthorized XML files contain decrypted passwords or other sensitive information.

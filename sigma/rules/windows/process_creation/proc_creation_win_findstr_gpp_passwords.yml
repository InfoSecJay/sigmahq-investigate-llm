  ### Technical Context
  The "Findstr GPP Passwords" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activity involving Group Policy Preferences (GPP) on Windows Domain Controllers. This rule looks for the use of the `find.exe` or `findstr.exe` utilities, which are command-line tools used to search for specific strings within files. The detection specifically focuses on command-line operations that search for the term "cpassword" within XML files located in the `\sysvol\` directory, as these files may contain sensitive credentials stored in an encrypted format. This technique aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of Credential Access (T1552.006), highlighting the risk of credential extraction from GPP files.
  When the rule is triggered, it implies that an attacker or an unauthorized user may be seeking to discover and decrypt these sensitive credentials, which can be achieved using tools like `gpp-decrypt`. The primary data sources leveraged for this detection include process creation logs, specifically filtering on command line parameters associated with potentially malicious behavior, as well as the associated metadata from the execution of these processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Events:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR solution for instances of `findstr.exe` or `find.exe` with command lines containing 'cpassword', focusing on the context and user account associated with these events.
  - **Examine Relevant XML Files:** Investigate the content of the XML files located in the `\sysvol\` directory that were accessed. Look for any encrypted `cpassword` values that may have been uncovered or accessed during the identified process executions.
  - **User Account Activity Review:** Analyze the activity of the user account that executed the commands to assess if it was a legitimate administrator task or an indication of compromised credentials seeking sensitive information.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Utilize your network detection capabilities to identify any outbound requests or network connections made by the process after the command execution, which may indicate data exfiltration or further malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the sensitivity of credentials potentially being accessed through this rule, alerts triggered by this detection are assigned a high severity level. Unauthorized access to GPP credentials could lead to further compromise within the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the relevant telemetry data is being logged accurately and consistently, particularly process creation logs and command-line parameters. It may not fire if the tools or methods of accessing the GPP passwords are obfuscated or if an adversary employs alternate techniques. Additionally, if 'find' or 'findstr' are renamed or replaced by similarly functioning utilities, such as custom scripts, the detection may fail to capture this activity. Analysts should be aware of these potential evasion tactics.

status: test
description: Detects a whoami.exe executed with the /priv command line flag instructing
  the tool to show all current user privileges. This is often used after a privilege
  escalation attempt.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule for "Security Privileges Enumeration Via Whoami.EXE" monitors the execution of the `whoami.exe` utility, specifically focusing on instances where it is invoked with the `/priv` command-line flag. This flag reveals all privileges associated with the current user, making it a potential indicator of malicious activity, particularly after a privilege escalation attempt. The rule leverages data from process creation logs on Windows systems, pinpointing instances where the image name matches `whoami.exe` and the command line contains the specified parameters indicating privilege queries. By identifying these behaviors, SOC analysts can correlate them with known tactics and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the tactics of Privilege Escalation and Discovery (Technique T1033) to ensure robust security monitoring.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Logs:** Review pan-aware process creation entries in the Windows Security logs to verify the execution of `whoami.exe` with the `/priv` parameter, noting the user and host involved.
  - **Correlate with Recent Activity:** Analyze any preceding security events for the affected user account, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized access, to determine if this execution may be part of a wider attack scenario.
  - **Examine User Privileges:** Utilize LDAP queries or your identity management system to assess the userâ€™s assigned privileges and roles around the time of the `whoami.exe` execution to identify any anomalies or deviations from the expected user profile.
  - **Review Endpoint Security Alerts:** Query EDR for any alerts related to the user or system initiating the `whoami.exe` command to discover any related suspicious activities or known threats that may have been identified recently.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as high severity because the execution of `whoami.exe` with the `/priv` flag typically follows an attempt to escalate privileges, which is a critical indicator of compromise in enterprise environments. Timely investigation is crucial to mitigate potential exploitation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `whoami.exe` is renamed or if the invocation occurs on non-Windows endpoints. Additionally, some legitimate administrative processes may inadvertently trigger it, leading to false positives. It's also assumed that monitoring of command-line parameters is adequately set up; if there is limited logging, this behavior could go undetected. Adversaries could bypass detection by using alternative methods to query privileges or running the command in ways that mask the execution signatures.

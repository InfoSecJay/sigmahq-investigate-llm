status: test
description: |
  An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain remote service is running on a remote device.
  When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen if it exists.
  A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service queried is not running.
  A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default) ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" if the provided remote host is unreachable

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects potential service reconnaissance activities performed via `WMIC.exe`, a Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line utility. The rule is focused on identifying instances where adversaries may utilize WMIC to query the status of services on remote devices. Specifically, it looks for process creation events involving `WMIC.exe`, along with command-line parameters containing the keyword 'service'. By analyzing patterns in the command-line arguments, the detection can highlight potentially malicious behavior in line with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation. Data sources used in this detection include Windows process creation logs, which capture the execution of processes and their command-line arguments, thus providing insights into the nature of the query made by the tool.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the EDR logs for the `WMIC.exe` process, noting its execution timestamp, parent process, and whether it is running from a trusted location.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Inspect the command-line parameters used with `WMIC.exe` for any references to specific services being queried. This may provide context on the intent behind the reconnaissance.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Examine network logs (NDR/NGFW) for any unusual outbound connections that coincide with the WMIC execution timeline, particularly connections to remote systems being queried.
  - **Review User Context:** Identify the user account that executed the WMIC command, and validate whether it aligns with expected behavior and permissions for system administration tasks.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is classified as medium due to the potential use of `WMIC.exe` for reconnaissance activities, which may precede more impactful actions such as lateral movement or service disruption.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the `WMIC.exe` process is not routinely used for legitimate administrative tasks within the environment. It may fail to capture operations if the WMIC commands are obfuscated, if the execution of the command occurs from unexpected contexts (e.g., command scripts in a normal userâ€™s profile), or if remote service queries are carried out via alternative methods or tools. Furthermore, environments with strict endpoint controls may restrict the execution of `WMIC.exe`, potentially leading to a lower detection rate.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious behavior where common scripting or command-line interfaces (such as `cmd.exe`, `PowerShell`, and `WScript`) spawn instances of `regsvr32.exe`. The detection is predicated on evaluating process creation logs, specifically focusing on command-line parameters that may indicate malicious activity. Importantly, the rule identifies instances where the parent process is a known script or command interpreter and filters for case scenarios where `regsvr32` is invoked to load potentially malicious DLLs, such as those found in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\RpcProxy\\`. This behavior could be indicative of a tactic under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the technique `T1218.010`, which pertains to the use of the `regsvr32` executable as a means of evading application whitelisting controls.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use your EDR solution to correlate the alert with process creation logs for `regsvr32.exe`, noting the parent process and command-line arguments used during its execution.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters**: Investigate the command line provided to `regsvr32.exe` for suspicious DLL file paths or flags that might indicate it's being used for nefarious purposes.
  - **Check for Related Network Activity**: Utilize your NDR capabilities to explore any network connections initiated by `regsvr32.exe` or its parent process, particularly looking for unusual outbound traffic patterns.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Query your SIEM for any user activity logs related to the time span of the alert, which might provide context on whether the execution of `regsvr32.exe` was legitimate.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the alert level is set to medium, it suggests a moderate risk associated with this behavior, possibly indicating an attempt to bypass application whitelisting. In an enterprise environment, such executions should be promptly investigated to mitigate potential breaches or malware deployment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where legitimate applications frequently leverage `regsvr32.exe` for benign purposes, which could lead to false positives. Additionally, if an attacker uses alternative methods to invoke DLLs or employs different parent processes not covered by the rule, detection may fail. It's also assumed that appropriate logging of process creation is enabled across the environment, which is vital for the rule to function effectively.

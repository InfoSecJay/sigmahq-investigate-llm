  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors the execution of "diskshadow.exe" in script mode using the "/s" flag, particularly when the script is sourced from potentially suspicious locations on the system. Diskshadow is a legitimate Windows utility that allows users to create and manage shadow copies, but it can also be leveraged by attackers to conduct malicious activities, such as evading detection and persistently accessing sensitive data, including the Active Directory database. The rule focuses on key parameters from process creation logs, specifically identifying command-line arguments that indicate the usage of Diskshadow in script mode. By looking for common paths such as `C:\Temp\`, `C:\Windows\Temp\`, and various Application Data directories, the rule helps to flag instances where the tool may not be used for its intended, benign purposes. Additionally, this rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques under "Defense Evasion" (T1218) since attackers often use legitimate tools to evade security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use Windows Event Logs to examine process creation events involving `diskshadow.exe` and verify the command-line parameters for suspicious flags and paths.
  - **Cross-reference with EDR Data**: Utilize EDR tools to determine if any additional malicious behavior occurred around the same timeframe, such as unusual child process creation or network connections initiated by the parent process.
  - **Assess Script Contents**: If the suspicious execution of Diskshadow is confirmed, analyze the associated script for malicious commands or common indicators of compromise (IoCs) that could further signify an attack.
  - **Check for Previous Executions**: Investigate whether similar executions of `diskshadow.exe` had occurred previously, especially from the same directories, to identify potential persistence mechanisms or patterns.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity of this alert is considered medium due to the potential of diskshadow.exe being misused by attackers for evasion and persistence, particularly in environments where sensitive data is at risk. Immediate investigation is recommended to rule out malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if `diskshadow.exe` is executed from a conventional directory, or if attackers use alternative methods to invoke the executable without the specified command-line flag. Additionally, false positives may arise from legitimate administrative tasks. A thorough understanding of typical operational use cases is essential to minimize unnecessary alerts.

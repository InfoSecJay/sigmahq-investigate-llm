  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects instances of WinRAR execution in non-standard folders, which could indicate potentially malicious activity, such as an attacker exploiting the tool for file compression or data exfiltration. The rule focuses on the execution of `rar.exe` and `winrar.exe`, monitoring for processes that originate from any directory outside of the default installation paths for WinRAR, typically found in `C:\Program Files` and `C:\Program Files (x86)`. Additionally, it specifically avoids flags related to `UnRAR.exe`, which is often used for extraction tasks and may not align with the concerns addressed by this rule. 
  The detection leverages Windows process creation logs and monitors for command line parameters that indicate unusual execution patterns. By analyzing such deviations, we can respond to potentially suspicious activities. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Collection" and the technique T1560.001, focusing on data from desktop or server environments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to investigate the process creation logs for the detected WinRAR execution, paying attention to the command line parameters and origin directories.
  - **Check Network Connections**: Analyze any associated network connections through the EDR or NDR tools to determine if data exfiltration is occurring, especially if WinRAR is running in a non-standard location.
  - **Correlate with User Activity**: Cross-reference the alert with user activity logs in the SIEM to ascertain whether the execution of WinRAR correlates with known legitimate user actions or scheduled tasks.
  - **Examine File Paths**: Investigate the files and directories involved in the execution to identify whether they contain sensitive data or if they exhibit other characteristics of malicious behavior, using system and application logs.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is marked as medium severity due to its potential to reveal unauthorized data compression or exfiltration attempts that may undermine the organization's security. Although legitimate use cases exist, the nature of the execution location prompts a closer examination to rule out malicious intent.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if WinRAR is executed from its default installation directory or if it is renamed or altered to obscure its invocation. Additionally, it relies on the presence of accurate process creation logs; if logging policies are insufficient or misconfigured, legitimate executions might be overlooked. The rule also assumes that users do not routinely execute WinRAR from insecure locations outside its intended paths, which could result in false negatives.

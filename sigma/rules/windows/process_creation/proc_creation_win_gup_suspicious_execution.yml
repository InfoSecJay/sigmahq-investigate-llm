  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious GUP Usage" Sigma rule is designed to detect instances where the Notepad++ updater (GUP.exe) is executed from atypical directories, particularly user-specific folders, which can indicate potential DLL side-loading attacks. The rule leverages process creation logs as its primary data source, filtering on the executable name (GUP.exe) and identifying its directory path to determine if it is running from locations like `AppData\Local` or `AppData\Roaming`. By specifically monitoring these directories, the rule aims to catch malicious attempts to abuse legitimate software technologies for gaining unauthorized access or executing harmful payloads. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of defense evasion (Techniques: T1574.002), highlighting the adversaries' attempts to disguise their malicious actions within normal operational processes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Examine recent entries in the Windows Security Event Logs or EDR solution to identify instances of GUP.exe execution and the associated user context.
  - **Analyze File Path:** Identify the full paths from which GUP.exe is executed, and cross-reference them with legitimate installations of Notepad++ to determine if the execution is occurring from suspicious directories.
  - **Inspect User Behavior:** Investigate the user accounts that triggered the alert, reviewing their recent activities, and checking for unusual behavior or potential compromises that may indicate account takeover.
  - **Review Network Connections:** Utilize network monitoring tools to analyze any outbound or suspicious network connections initiated by the processes related to GUP.exe to ascertain potential data exfiltration or command/control communication.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level of this alert is classified as high due to the potential for a malicious actor to exploit the Notepad++ updater as part of a DLL side-loading attack, which could lead to unauthorized code execution and compromise of the system.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the Notepad++ updater is executed legitimately from its normal installation directories or if the malicious executable has been renamed. Additionally, if users have downloaded and executed similar executable names from untrusted sources that do not follow the typical path (e.g., custom installations), the rule may miss such instances. It is essential for detection engineers to consider the environment's unique software landscape, as various legitimate applications could produce noise if named similarly to GUP.exe.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious activity associated with the execution of GUP.exe, the updater for Notepad++. The rule looks for instances where GUP.exe is being executed from unexpected directories, specifically within user profile paths like AppData or a userâ€™s installation folders, rather than standard locations such as Program Files. This behavior is of particular concern because attackers often leverage legitimate tools and applications for DLL side-loading attacks, leading to the execution of malicious code. By monitoring process creation logs and filtering based on file paths, security teams can effectively identify and investigate these suspicious executions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Check EDR logs for the execution details of GUP.exe, focusing on the full path from where it was launched to determine if it deviates from standard Notepad++ installation paths.
  - Analyze the command-line parameters associated with the GUP.exe process to identify any unusual arguments that may indicate malicious intent.
  - Utilize AV logs to see if any alerts were triggered around the same time as the suspicious GUP.exe execution, providing context to any potential malware activity.
  - Review network logs for any suspicious outbound connections made by GUP.exe, which may reveal attempts to communicate with known malicious domains or IP addresses.

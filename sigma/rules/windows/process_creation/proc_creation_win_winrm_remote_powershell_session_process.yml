  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potential unauthorized remote PowerShell sessions by monitoring the execution of `wsmprovhost.exe`, the host process for Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Specifically, the rule looks for instances where `wsmprovhost.exe` appears as either a parent or child process in the Windows process creation logs. The detection is achieved through monitoring relevant telemetry data, particularly focusing on the Windows Sysmon logs related to process creation. Given that the PowerShell remote sessions can represent legitimate administration use cases or potentially malicious activities, this rule is pivotal for identifying unexpected remote execution attempts, which align with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059.001) and Remote Services (T1021.006).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review recent alerts from your EDR platform related to `wsmprovhost.exe` executions to determine if the requests originated from known, authorized entities or if they are unusual, highlighting potential unauthorized access.
  - **Analyze Sysmon Logs:** Use Sysmon logs to investigate the command line arguments for `wsmprovhost.exe` instances to identify any suspicious or unexpected commands being executed during these sessions.
  - **Inspect User Accounts:** Verify the account that initiated the remote PowerShell session by cross-referencing the User field captured in the logs with the organization's list of authorized administrator accounts.
  - **Correlate with Firewall Logs:** Examine any associated network connections from the time of the detected session by analyzing firewall logs; look for unusual external connections that may confirm or deny malicious activities.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity because while remote PowerShell sessions are commonplace among administrators for legitimate purposes, they can also be indicative of compromise or lateral movement, requiring prompt investigation to rule out malicious activity.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several considerations that could affect the efficacy of this rule. One potential blind spot is the legitimate use of `wsmprovhost.exe` by authorized administrators for remote management purposes, which may lead to false positives. Furthermore, if an adversary uses alternate methods of remote execution or manipulates command line arguments judiciously, the alert may not fire. It is also assumed that the detection environment is properly configured to capture all necessary Sysmon logs without exclusions that might mask such activities.

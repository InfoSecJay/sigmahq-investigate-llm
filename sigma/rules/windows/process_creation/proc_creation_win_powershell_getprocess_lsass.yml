  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to identify possible credential theft activities by detecting the use of the "Get-Process" cmdlet in PowerShell to access the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process. The LSASS process is a critical component in Windows that is responsible for handling the security policy and storing user credentials. Attackers often target LSASS to extract sensitive information, such as user credentials, and the invocation of commands like `Get-Process lsas`, `ps lsas`, or `gps lsas` indicates potentially malicious behavior. The detection relies on process creation logs, specifically monitoring command-line parameters associated with PowerShell activity.
  The rule triggers when any commands indicative of querying the LSASS process are detected, signaling that the process may have been targeted for credential harvesting. Given the significance of LSASS in maintaining system security, this rule serves as an important tool in identifying and responding to potential threats.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Use the EDR solution to review the specific event where the PowerShell command was executed, paying attention to the user context and timing of the execution.
  - Investigate related process activity to determine the sequence of actions leading up to and following the command execution, looking for any abnormal behavior or other suspicious processes.
  - Check for any alerts or logs from the AV products that may indicate whether similar activities have been flagged on other endpoints within the environment.
  - Examine security logs from the NGFW and Proxy to identify any anomalous network connections initiated from the host that executed the command, which could indicate data exfiltration attempts.

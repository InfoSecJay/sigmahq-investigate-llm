  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Potentially Suspicious Regsvr32 HTTP/FTP Pattern" targets the execution of the Windows utility `regsvr32.exe`, which can be misused by attackers to dynamically download and register DLL files from web (HTTP) or file transfer protocol (FTP) servers. By monitoring process creation logs that capture details about the executed command lines, the rule looks for instances where `regsvr32.exe` is invoked with specific command-line arguments indicative of possible malicious activity. Key indicators include the use of the `/i` or `-i` flags alongside URLs that begin with `http` or `ftp`, suggesting that the process is being used to fetch and register DLLs from external sources, a technique known to align with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218.010 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution).
  This rule relies primarily on the `process_creation` log category from Windows systems to analyze the command-line arguments of the executed processes, enabling security analysts to identify potentially illicit activities associated with the abuse of `regsvr32`.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Examine the process creation logs in your EDR solution for instances of `regsvr32.exe` being executed along with any abnormal command-line arguments including `/i`, `-i`, `http`, or `ftp`.
  - **Correlate with Network Traffic:** Use NDR tools to correlate the timing of the detected `regsvr32` command with any outgoing HTTP or FTP connections to identify potential callbacks or external communications with malicious servers.
  - **Review Suspicious DLLs:** Investigate any DLLs that were registered through `regsvr32` by analyzing file creation/modification events in Windows Security logs and assessing their origin and legitimacy.
  - **Conduct Malware Scans:** Utilize AV tools to scan the system for potential malware that could have been introduced via the detected command, ensuring that any suspicious DLLs are properly analyzed and quarantined.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity because, while executing `regsvr32` itself is not inherently malicious, its usage in conjunction with external HTTP/FTP sources indicates a potential for malicious behavior. Given the security contexts of enterprise environments, these behaviors warrant further investigation due to their association with techniques used to execute arbitrary code.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several assumptions and blind spots associated with this rule. First, the rule may fail to detect certain threat actors who avoid using `regsvr32` for executing their payloads or obfuscate parameters to escape detection. Additionally, legitimate administrative processes that utilize `regsvr32` might trigger false positives, particularly if any legitimate operations involve downloading DLLs from trusted sources. Finally, if security policies restrict outbound traffic to HTTP/FTP, this rule may not observe any activity. Analysts should validate findings against secondary telemetry sources to mitigate these risks.

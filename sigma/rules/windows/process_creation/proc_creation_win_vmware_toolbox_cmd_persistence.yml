  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule aims to detect potential persistence mechanisms associated with virtual machines through the execution of `VMwareToolBoxCmd.exe`. This executable is part of the VMware Tools suite and provides command-line options for managing virtual machines. In this context, the rule focuses on detecting command-line invocations of `VMwareToolBoxCmd.exe` where specific flags (`script` and `set`) are used, indicating that a script is being set to run for a virtual machineâ€™s state change. The data sources for this detection primarily include process creation logs from Windows, allowing analysts to capture the necessary command-line parameters, and the original filename attributes to confirm the legitimate nature of the executable. The rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of execution (T1203) and persistence (T1059), as it can be indicative of an adversary attempting to establish a backdoor or maintain access to a compromised environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR to confirm the execution of `VMwareToolBoxCmd.exe` along with the associated command-line arguments ('script' and 'set').
    
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Investigate any network connections that may have occurred at the time of the alert. Cross-reference these with known malicious IPs or domains that could relate to compromised processes.
    
  - **Inspect Script Contents:** If a script was set to execute via the command line, retrieve and analyze its contents to determine its purpose and whether it is malicious or benign.
    
  - **Review Historical Data:** Look for previous instances of the same command and assess whether this behavior is consistent with normal operations within your environment, identifying any anomalies in VM management practices.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is considered of medium severity due to the potential for establishing persistence on virtual machines, which could allow an adversary to maintain access within the network, making it crucial to investigate promptly.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary employs similar processes with different names or only uses indirect methods to invoke scripts without the specified command-line parameters. Furthermore, if process creation logging is not appropriately configured or if VMware Tools are not used within the organization, the rule may not detect all potential malicious activities. Adversaries might also utilize legitimate scripts to evade detection, complicating the investigation.

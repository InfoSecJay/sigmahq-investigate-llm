  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Console CodePage Lookup Via CHCP" aims to detect the execution of the `chcp` command, which is a Windows console command used to display or set the active code page in the command prompt. This command can be used by attackers as part of their reconnaissance efforts to identify system locale settings, which can inform their subsequent exploitation strategies. The detection leverages process creation logs that track when `chcp.com` is invoked as a child process of `cmd.exe` with specific command-line parameters indicative of legitimate usage patterns. It specifically seeks patterns in the command line that suggest the command is used with options that route through `windash`, indicating a potential scripted or automated context. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1614.001 (System Information Discovery) within the Discovery tactic.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Process Logs**: Search for the `chcp.com` execution within the process logs, focusing on the parent process `cmd.exe` and any related command-line arguments to establish the context of the command execution.
  - **Review Command History**: Investigate the command history for any anomalies or patterns that could indicate malicious usage of `chcp`, especially in conjunction with other system discovery commands.
  - **Assess Network Activity**: Examine any outbound network connections that may have coincided with the execution of `chcp` to identify potential data exfiltration or further lateral movement attempts.
  - **Cross-Reference with User Activity**: Look into user activity logs around the time of the alert to determine if legitimate user actions correlate with the execution, potentially ruling out false positives from known applications like Anaconda or Discord.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the rule's focus on a command commonly used for reconnaissance, the severity level is marked as medium. Alerts indicate potential preparatory steps for exploitation, warranting prompt investigation to assess potential risks within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in cases where the `chcp` command is executed as part of legitimate system updates or application behaviors (e.g., during Anaconda updates or by software like Discord). Additionally, there may be instances where attackers could use alternative methods to determine system settings without invoking `chcp`, bypassing detection entirely. It's also important to consider that not all instances of `chcp` will indicate malicious activity, thus necessitating thorough contextual investigation.

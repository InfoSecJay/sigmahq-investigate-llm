  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Suspicious Manipulation Of Default Accounts Via Net.EXE" aims to identify potentially malicious activities involving default accounts such as 'Administrator' and 'Guest.' It focuses on specific operations performed using the `net.exe` and `net1.exe` commands, which are commonly used to enable, disable, or modify the properties of user accounts. The rule captures relevant telemetry by monitoring process creation events, specifically looking for command-line invocations of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` that either include keywords related to user account actions (e.g., enabling or disabling accounts) or target known default accounts. 
  This detection aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Collection" and technique "T1560.001" as it pertains to an adversary's potential actions to manipulate user accounts in preparation for further infiltration or lateral movement within the environment. By understanding the command-line structures and clues left by these commands, incident responders can quickly determine whether an event is part of a legitimate administrative task or indicates an attempted breach.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Logs:** Inspect EDR logs to identify the context of the process creation, focusing on the command-line arguments used when `net.exe` or `net1.exe` was invoked. Verify if the command indicates an unauthorized manipulation of a default account.
  - **Check User Activity:** Look into Windows Security Event Logs for corresponding events (e.g., account enable/disable events) around the same time to identify any legitimate or suspicious user activities associated with the accounts in question.
  - **Perform Network Analysis:** Analyze network logs via NDR to identify whether there were unusual connections made during the time of the alerts, especially to sensitive systems that may indicate lateral movement.
  - **Validate Admin Scripts:** If false positives are frequent, obtain and review any scripts or automation processes that legitimate administrators might use that could trigger these alerts. This will help refine detection thresholds.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the alert's focus on manipulation of critical default accounts, its high-severity classification underscores the potential for significant risks associated with unauthorized access or privilege escalation, making timely response essential.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in environments where `net.exe` is not utilized for account management as organizations might use Group Policy or alternative methods. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries could obfuscate their commands or use other utilities to change account settings without triggering this rule. The assumptions made in this rule may also lead to false positives during legitimate administrative activity, especially in environments with custom or automated administrative scripts.

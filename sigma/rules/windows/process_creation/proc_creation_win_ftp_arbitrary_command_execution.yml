  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Arbitrary Command Execution Via FTP.EXE" is designed to detect the execution of `ftp.exe` with specific parameters that indicate potentially malicious activity. This rule focuses on monitoring Windows process creation events, particularly those involving `ftp.exe` as either a parent or child process. By inspecting the command line arguments for the presence of the `-s` or `/s` flag, which signifies the execution of a script, the rule flags potentially unauthorized use of FTP commands that could lead to arbitrary command execution. The investigation leverages Windows Event Logs, particularly focusing on the Process Creation log, supplemented by data from other sources like Sysmon, which can provide enhanced visibility into process activities and parent-child relationships.
  This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Execution (T1059) and Defense Evasion (T1202). The focus on `ftp.exe` suggests that an adversary may attempt to exploit its capabilities to execute commands or scripts on a compromised system while avoiding detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Source Processes:** Check the EDR logs for the execution timeline of the identified `ftp.exe` process to determine its parent process and any spawned child processes. Investigate whether any suspicious or unauthorized activities coincide with this execution.
  - **Analyze Command Line Arguments:** Review the command line parameters associated with `ftp.exe`. Pay particular attention to any use of the `-s` or `/s` flags to ascertain if a script was executed that could contain harmful commands.
  - **Network Activity Review:** Consult network logs for any unusual outbound connections initiated by the detected `ftp.exe`. Cross-reference these connections with known malicious IP addresses or domains to identify potential data exfiltration.
  - **Cross-reference User Behavior:** Examine user account activity associated with the execution of `ftp.exe`. Check for anomalies in user behavior or access patterns, especially if the account is not typically associated with FTP usage.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as medium severity due to the potential for arbitrary command execution, which can lead to further exploitation of the environment. Immediate investigation is warranted to understand the context of the execution and potential impact on systems.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire in environments where `ftp.exe` is heavily utilized for legitimate purposes, leading to potential false negatives for compromised systems leveraging valid user credentials. Additionally, the rule does not account for encrypted FTP sessions or the use of other FTP clients that might not invoke `ftp.exe` directly. Bad actors may also use techniques to obfuscate command line inputs, which could prevent the rule from triggering.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potential tampering with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) related registry keys via the `reg.exe` utility on Windows systems. Specifically, the rule monitors for commands that modify registry values under the path `CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server`, which can crucially affect RDP service configurations, including enabling or disabling concurrent sessions. The monitoring leverages process creation logs to detect the execution of `reg.exe` with specific command-line arguments that indicate an intention to alter important RDP settings, thereby facilitating lateral movement or defense evasion tactics as documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework (tactics T1021.001 for Remote Services 
  - Remote Desktop Protocol and T1112 for Modify Registry).
  The relevant data sources for this detection include process creation logs, which capture events where processes are started, and specifically focus on command-line parameters being passed to `reg.exe`. By filtering for specific keywords and registry paths in the command line, the rule can flag potentially malicious changes to RDP configurations that attackers may exploit for unauthorized access or persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR solutions to investigate the process creation events specifically related to `reg.exe` to determine the context and user account associated with the alterations.
  - **Examine Command-Line Parameters:** Analyze the command-line arguments for the detected instances of `reg.exe` to identify any potentially malicious intent behind the modifications to registry keys.
  - **Check User Attribution:** Cross-reference the execution of `reg.exe` with Windows Security Event logs to ascertain if the process was initiated by an authorized user or a potentially compromised account.
  - **Correlate with RDP Sessions:** Use logs from RDP connections to determine if there have been any unauthorized access attempts or active sessions that coincide with the registry modifications detected by this rule.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is considered high severity due to the critical nature of RDP configurations within an enterprise environment. Malicious tampering with RDP settings can grant attackers unwanted access and control over systems, leading to potential data breaches or full domain compromises.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  It is important to acknowledge that this detection may not trigger if an adversary uses alternate means to modify the registry, such as employing custom scripts or utilizing other administrative tools outside of `reg.exe`. Additionally, if command-line logging is turned off, or if the adversary utilizes obfuscation techniques, the rule may fail to catch the activity. Assumptions include the belief that all legitimate use cases of `reg.exe` are benign, which may not always hold true, especially in environments where administrative privileges are misused or compromised.

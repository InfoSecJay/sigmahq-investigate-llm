falsepositives:
- Weird admins that rename their tools
- Software companies that bundle PAExec with their software and rename it, so that
  it is less embarrassing
- When executed with the "-s" flag. PAExec will copy itself to the "C:\Windows\" directory
  with a different name. Usually like this "PAExec-[XXXXX]-[ComputerName]"

  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed PAExec Execution" detection rule identifies potentially malicious activity related to PAExec, a tool often exploited by attackers for remote execution and system manipulation. This rule specifically monitors the `process_creation` event logs on Windows systems, looking for the execution of instances of PAExec where the executable has been renamed or exists in non-standard file paths. By checking the original file name, product name, and hash values associated with known PAExec variants, the rule can discern legitimate uses from potentially malicious ones. When an alert is generated, it signals that the execution of PAExec, which is often associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1202 (APIs), warrants further scrutiny for possible unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review the process creation logs in your EDR tool to find instances of PAExec and validate the command line arguments and initiated parent processes.
  - **Examine File Path and Hash:** Investigate the file path of the triggered executable to determine if it originates from known benign locations. Cross-reference the file hashes against known-good sources to verify their legitimacy.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Analyze any related network connections made by PAExec to observe destinations it attempted to reach, looking for any suspicious external communications.
  - **Audit User Activity:** Correlate the execution with user activity or administrative access logs to determine whether the action aligns with expected behavior and whether it was performed by an authorized user.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for PAExec usage in lateral movement and remote execution by adversaries, any alert triggered by this rule should be treated with high severity, requiring immediate investigation to mitigate risks to the organization's security posture.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that PAExec, when renamed, typically follows a certain pattern in execution and that logs for process creation are being adequately collected. However, it may not fire if attackers utilize custom compiled versions of PAExec or if logs are misconfigured or insufficiently detailed. Additionally, in environments where legitimate renaming of PAExec executables occurs (like by software vendors), false positives may arise.

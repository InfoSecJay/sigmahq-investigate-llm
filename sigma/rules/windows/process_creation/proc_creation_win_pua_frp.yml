  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP), a tool often used to expose local servers behind NAT or firewall configurations to the internet. The rule specifically monitors Windows process creation events for distinct executable names (such as `frpc.exe` and `frps.exe`) and checks for command-line inputs indicative of configuration files (e.g., `frpc.ini`). Additionally, the rule assesses cryptographic hash values of the executable files to ensure they match known variants of FRP, thereby adding a layer of validation to detect potential misuse. 
  The alert relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1090 (Connection Proxy), which highlights scenarios where attackers may use proxy services to redirect and obfuscate network traffic, facilitating command and control (C2) communications. By focusing on both names and hashes, the detection provides a broad coverage of potential FRP usages that could signify malicious activity in the network.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs**: Utilize EDR solutions to examine process creation logs related to `frpc.exe` and `frps.exe`. Pay attention to the timestamps and user context to validate if the execution is legitimate or suspicious.
    
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: Check the command-line arguments associated with the execution of any detected FRP instances using Windows Event Logs or EDR. Look specifically for unusual parameters or paths to configuration files that may indicate improper usage.
  - **Cross-Reference File Hashes**: Use threat intelligence tools to verify the detected file hashes against known malware signatures and legitimate software repositories. This step will help ascertain whether the detected instances are potentially harmful.
  - **Monitor Network Activity**: Investigate any associated network connections made by the identified processes via NDR or firewall logs. Look for outbound connections to IP addresses that are not part of the organization's infrastructure, which may indicate a potential C2 communication.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is deemed high severity because the misuse of FRP can facilitate unauthorized network access, making it crucial to investigate promptly to mitigate potential data breaches or compromised infrastructure.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several blind spots and assumptions associated with this rule. For instance, it may not trigger if attackers rename FRP executables to evade detection or if the tool is executed from uncommon paths. Furthermore, legitimate usage of FRP in the organization could lead to false positives, necessitating thorough investigation context. Engineers should also consider that obfuscated command-line arguments could bypass this detection if the relevant telemetry is not captured effectively.

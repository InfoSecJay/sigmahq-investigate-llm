  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Suspicious Remote Child Process From Outlook" is designed to detect potentially malicious activity involving Outlook. Specifically, it identifies cases where an Outlook process (outlook.exe) spawns a child process, and the child process is executed from an image located in a remote location, such as an SMB or WebDAV share. This behavior is often indicative of an adversary attempting to leverage legitimate email applications as a vector for executing malicious code, potentially achieving persistence or executing harmful actions unnoticed.
  The rule leverages process creation logs as its primary data source. It examines the parameters and characteristics of processes initiated by Outlook, particularly looking for parent-child relationships that originate from Outlook. The MITRE ATT&CK tactics involved here include Execution (T1059) and Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1202), emphasizing that attackers commonly exploit legitimate applications to carry out their objectives.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Use EDR tools to review the process creation logs related to Outlook, specifically noting any child processes that originate from outlook.exe and whether they involve suspicious remote paths.
  - **Examine Child Process Behavior:** Analyze the behavior of the identified child processes using relevant tools to check if they exhibit anomalous or malicious actions, such as unusual network connections or file modifications.
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Leverage network monitoring tools (NDR/NGFW) to evaluate any outbound connections initiated by the suspicious child processes, assessing for connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  - **Correlate with Security Logs:** Check Windows Security and Application logs for any alerts or abnormal events related to process creation or network activity involving Outlook and the implicated child process.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the implications of a remote process being spawned from a trusted application like Outlook. Such behavior could indicate a significant security breach and require immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - The detection rule may not fire if Outlook is running in a non-standard environment or if security logging is not properly implemented. Additionally, legitimate tools utilizing remote shares could trigger false positives.
  - The rule assumes that remote images are always malicious, which might not be true in all contexts, leading to potential benign cases being overlooked. 
  - Adversaries could also employ obfuscation techniques to disguise malicious child processes or utilize local paths to evade detection entirely.

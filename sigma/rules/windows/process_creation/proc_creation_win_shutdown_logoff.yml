  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious use of the Windows command-line tool `shutdown.exe` specifically when it is invoked with the command-line argument to log off a user (`/l`). While the legitimate use of this command is common in network administration, its rare invocation can signal potential misuse or malicious intent, such as an attempt to disrupt user sessions or execute further attacks. The rule leverages the `process_creation` log source, focusing on event logs that capture details about the execution of processes, including the name of the executable and the command-line parameters used. The detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Impact" and the technique T1529, which highlights the adversary's ability to affect system operations or user sessions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Examine the process creation logs in your EDR or Sysmon data for any occurrences of `shutdown.exe` with the `/l` parameter. Check for any unusual execution context, such as unexpected user accounts or non-standard execution paths.
    
  - **User Activity Audit:** Investigate the user activity around the time of the alert using Windows Security logs. Determine if the user whose session was logged off had any recent high-risk behavior or if multiple logoff commands originated from unusual sources.
  - **Correlate Network Activity:** Utilize your NDR or Proxy logs to identify any associated network activity that might indicate further malicious behavior around the same timestamp. Look particularly for connections to suspicious IP addresses or domains.
  - **Review Remote Access Logs:** Check for remote access sessions initiated through modes such as VPN or RDP around the time of the alert. Unusual remote sessions or access attempts could indicate an adversary's presence.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is set to medium due to the potential for this command's misuse to interrupt legitimate user activity or signal further reconnaissance and exploitation efforts by an adversary within the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where users legitimately use the `shutdown.exe /l` command frequently, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if the command is executed through batch scripts or other automation tools, it may evade detection. It's also important to note that adversaries could attempt to disguise their actions by renaming `shutdown.exe` or using other executables with similar functionality, making it crucial to continuously monitor deviations from normal process behavior.

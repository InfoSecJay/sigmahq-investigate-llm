  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule detects the execution of the Ditsnap tool, a utility specifically designed for inspecting the Active Directory database file (ntds.dit). The rule looks for process creation events where the image name ends with 'ditsnap.exe' and/or where the command line of the process contains 'ditsnap.exe'. These indicators suggest potential unauthorized access to the Active Directory database, which could be a precursor to credential theft or other malicious activities. The primary data source for this detection is Windows process creation logs, which capture detailed information about executed processes, including their command-line parameters and parent-child relationships.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Query EDR logs for any instances of 'ditsnap.exe' being executed in the last 72 hours, paying special attention to unusual parent processes that may indicate malicious behavior.
  - Review command-line arguments associated with the 'ditsnap.exe' execution to identify any suspicious parameters that may provide insight into an attacker's intent.
  - Check network logs in conjunction with proxy or VPN logs to trace any outbound connections made by the system running 'ditsnap.exe' for potential data exfiltration.
  - Investigate user account activity associated with the execution of 'ditsnap.exe' to determine if the account used has legitimate administrative privileges or if it has been compromised.

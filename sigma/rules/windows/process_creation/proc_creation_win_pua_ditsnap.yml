  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "PUA 
  - DIT Snapshot Viewer" is designed to detect the execution of the Ditsnap tool, which is often used for inspecting the Active Directory database (ntds.dit). This tool has gained notoriety for its potential use in post-exploitation scenarios, particularly by adversaries attempting to extract sensitive credential information. The rule specifically monitors process creation events and looks for instances where the process `ditsnap.exe` is initiated, either directly through command-line parameters or file paths. The detection relies on Windows process creation logs, where critical data sources include the process image and command-line details captured by Sysmon or other endpoint detection and response tools. This detection falls under the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactic of Credential Access (T1003.003), emphasizing the importance of understanding the implications of using such tools in an enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Utilize EDR tools to review the details of the detected process, including the parent process, user context, and execution time to identify any anomalous behavior or patterns.
  - **Review Command-Line Arguments:** Analyze command-line parameters associated with `ditsnap.exe` to ascertain the intent of use and any potential malicious payloads or flags that could indicate an exploit attempt.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Cross-reference the timing of the alert with user activity logs in the SIEM and Active Directory to determine whether the usage was legitimate admin activity or a potential security threat.
  - **Examine Network Connection:** Investigate any network connections made by `ditsnap.exe` to determine if the tool has communicated with external IP addresses that may raise red flags, indicating data exfiltration or C2 communications.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert has been designated a high severity level due to the heightened risk associated with unauthorized use of credential access tools like Ditsnap, which can lead to significant data breaches within the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One primary assumption is that all instances of `ditsnap.exe` execution are unauthorized, which may lead to false positives from legitimate administrative processes. Additionally, if the tool is invoked in a stealthy manner — such as through PowerShell or alternative execution methods — it may not be logged or detected, leading to potential gaps in visibility for detection. Furthermore, if adversaries manipulate execution paths or utilize other anti-detection techniques, this rule may fail to fire.

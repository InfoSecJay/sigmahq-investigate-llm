  ### Technical Context
  The "Disabled IE Security Features" Sigma rule identifies potential attempts to disable critical security features in Internet Explorer by monitoring command line parameters associated with process creation events. It specifically looks for command lines that contain certain patterns indicating registry modifications aimed at disabling Internet Explorer security settings. The key modifications detected are related to parameters such as `IEHarden`, `DEPOff`, and `DisableFirstRunCustomize`, which are associated with reducing the security posture of the browser. The primary data sources leveraged for this detection are Windows process creation logs and command-line arguments, which provide insight into the actions taken by processes running on the system. This rule correlates with the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: **Defense Evasion**, under the technique **T1562.001: Disable or Modify Tools**.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs**: Use EDR tools to review process creation logs around the time the alert was triggered to identify the associated process and user context.
  - **Investigate Command Line Parameters**: Analyze the specific command line arguments captured in the alert to understand the intent and potential malicious behavior.
  - **Review Registry Change Logs**: Examine Windows Event Logs for any recent modifications to the registry keys related to Internet Explorer security settings for further insights.
  - **Correlate with Other Data Sources**: Utilize network monitoring and proxy logs to identify any subsequent behaviors or communications from the affected process that may indicate further compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is tagged as high severity due to the critical nature of Internet Explorer security features that, when disabled, can expose the organization to vulnerabilities and potentially facilitate further malicious activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While the rule is designed to capture specific command line modifications, it may fail to trigger if malware employs obfuscation techniques or runs in a non-standard environment that does not generate typical process creation logs. Additionally, the detection relies on the assumption that processes executing these commands will not be redirected or handled by legitimate administrative tools that do not generate alerts. Security teams should remain vigilant for contextual anomalies that could indicate attempts to evade detection.

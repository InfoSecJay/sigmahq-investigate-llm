  ### Technical Context
  The "Php Inline Command Execution" detection rule monitors Windows process creation events to identify potentially malicious use of PHP. Specifically, it looks for instances where PHP is executed with the '-r' flag in the command line, which allows users to run PHP code directly from the command line without creating a script file. This execution method can potentially be exploited by an attacker to initiate a reverse shell or execute arbitrary PHP code, making it essential for incident responders to recognize such behavior. The rule utilizes process creation logs as its primary data source, focusing on the image name for the PHP executable (`php.exe`) and scrutinizing the command line arguments for the presence of the '-r' flag.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Utilize the EDR tool to investigate the process creation logs that triggered the alert, focusing on the user account and execution context of the PHP process.
  - Check the command line parameters for additional flags or suspicious arguments that might indicate an intent to compromise the system further.
  - Cross-reference the time of the alert with network activity logs from the NDR to identify any outbound connections that correlate with the execution of the PHP command.
  - Review AV logs to see if any malicious file activity was detected before or after the execution of the PHP command, particularly related to scripts or web shell activity.

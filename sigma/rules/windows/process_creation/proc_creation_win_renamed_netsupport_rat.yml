  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of a renamed instance of the NetSupport Remote Access Tool (RAT) by monitoring process creation events on Windows systems. Specifically, the rule looks for processes with the product name "NetSupport Remote Control" and the original file name "client32.exe", while also ensuring that the imported hash matches a known signature of the RAT. The rule cross-references these parameters to prevent legitimate instances of `client32.exe` (which might be benign in nature) from triggering an alert when the executable is invoked in its expected form. By leveraging telemetry collected from Windows security logs, this rule serves as a detector for potential malicious activity aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion and the associated technique of "Masquerading" (T1036).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution Context**: Use your EDR tool to review the execution context of the detected process, focusing on the user account and any parent processes that initiated the execution.
  - **Examine Network Activity**: Analyze outbound network connections associated with the process to identify any suspicious activity, especially connections to external or anomalous IP addresses.
  - **Investigate Related Files**: Review file system events around the timestamp of the alert, checking for additional files created or modified by the involved process that may indicate a broader compromise.
  - **Review Historical Logs**: Look into previous logs from Windows Event logs and Sysmon to establish if there have been other instances of process creation or modifications related to the same create or installed programs.
  ### Prioritization
  Due to the nature of remote access tools and their potential use in facilitating unauthorized access or other malicious activities, alerts for renamed NetSupport RAT execution should be treated as high severity, warranting immediate investigative efforts.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where the NetSupport RAT is not commonly used, resulting in a lack of known signatures from prior deployments. Additionally, attackers may modify the process signatures or use alternative disguises not covered by this rule, rendering it ineffective if the behavior is too varied from what is monitored. There is an assumption that process creation telemetry is enabled and properly configured across the infrastructure, which may not always be the case.

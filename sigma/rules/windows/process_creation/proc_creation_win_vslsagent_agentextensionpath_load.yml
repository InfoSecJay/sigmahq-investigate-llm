  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect the execution of the Microsoft Visual Studio `vsls-agent.exe` in a suspicious manner, specifically focusing on its use of the `--agentExtensionPath` parameter. The rule analyzes process creation logs to identify instances where this executable is launched with the specified command line argument, while also checking for a filter condition that limits the detection to cases not involving a legitimate `Microsoft.VisualStudio.LiveShare.Agent` library load. This mechanism is critical since legitimate use of `vsls-agent.exe` in development environments may not necessarily denote malicious activity. 
  In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this detection rule aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic (T1105, **Command-and-Control**) and the technique (T1218, **Signed Binary Proxy Execution**), highlighting the potential misuse of trusted binaries to evade security measures.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine the CommandLine Details**: Use EDR tools to review the command line arguments associated with the `vsls-agent.exe` execution, focusing on the `--agentExtensionPath` parameter to assess potential malicious intent.
  - **Assess the Parent Process**: Investigate the ParentCommandLine field in process creation logs to determine the legitimacy of the process that initiated `vsls-agent.exe`, which may offer context on whether this execution is a part of an authorized workflow.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity**: Check network connection logs to see if the command initiated any communications that resemble command-and-control activities, particularly in relation to unusual outbound connections.
  - **Review Historical Usage**: Query historical logs to determine if `vsls-agent.exe` has been used previously in a similar manner within your environment, benchmarking against known processes to identify anomalies.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this rule represents a medium severity level due to the high potential for `vsls-agent.exe` to be exploited for malicious purposes, particularly if it's utilized in ways outside typical development workflows.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where `vsls-agent.exe` is customarily used without suspicious command-line modifications, leading to possible false negatives. Additionally, if an adversary uses alternate methods to execute malicious code (e.g., renaming, obfuscating, or using different binaries), the detection rule could fail to fire. It assumes consistent logging of process creation events on Windows systems, which may not be enabled in all environments.

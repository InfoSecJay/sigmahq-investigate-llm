  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activity involving the execution of Microsoft's Visual Studio `vsls-agent.exe` process, particularly when it is invoked with the `--agentExtensionPath` command-line parameter. This combination may indicate potential misuse of the Visual Studio Live Share feature, which could be exploited for defense evasion or as a means of establishing unauthorized connections. The rule specifically looks for instances where the `vsls-agent.exe` is running, while distinguishing valid uses from potentially malicious behavior by filtering for command-line parameters associated with legitimate operations. Data sources for this detection include Windows process creation logs that capture details about executed processes and their associated command-line arguments.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the EDR logs for instances of `vsls-agent.exe` execution, focusing on the associated command-line arguments to determine if the `--agentExtensionPath` flag has been used inappropriately. 
  - Check the parent process that initiated `vsls-agent.exe` to understand the context of the command, which may provide insights into whether the execution was expected or suspicious.
  - Correlate findings with firewall logs to identify any outbound connections made by the process, which could indicate attempts to communicate with external entities.
  - Examine the organizationâ€™s usage policies around Visual Studio and Live Share to understand if this execution aligns with normal operational behavior or if it should be escalated for further investigation.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potential session hijacking attempts through the execution of the `curl.exe` command-line tool, specifically when it is used with options that indicate cookie management, such as the `-c` flag or `--cookie-jar`. These flags enable attackers to save cookies that could contain sensitive session data, allowing for unauthorized access to user sessions. The rule looks for process creation events in Windows where `curl.exe` is executed with these specified command-line parameters. The primary data sources involved are Windows process creation logs, which provide details about running processes, including the image name and command-line arguments. This alert aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Execution" (ID: T1203), highlighting potentially malicious activity within the enterprise environment.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Execution:** Check the EDR for instances of `curl.exe` being executed. Note the user context and timing to discern if the execution aligns with legitimate administrative activity or if it occurred unexpectedly.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** For each detected instance of `curl.exe`, review the command-line arguments logged. Focus specifically on those including the `-c` and `--cookie-jar` flags, which could indicate a deliberate attempt to save session cookies.
  - **Check for Abnormal Parental Relationships:** Investigate the parent process of the `curl.exe` execution to identify how the command was invoked. Determine if it's associated with legitimate administrative or automated tasks or if there's an unusual origin that warrants further scrutiny.
  - **Review Related Network Activity:** Use NDR and proxy logs to analyze outbound connections originating from the machine where the rule was triggered. Pay special attention to any anomalies or data leaks that align with cookie theft or session hijacking attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  Due to the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches associated with session hijacking, such alerts should be regarded with medium severity. Immediate investigation is crucial as it may indicate an active threat.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that `curl.exe` is present and utilized within the environment for legitimate purposes. It may not trigger if users rely on other tools for similar tasks or if `curl.exe` is not installed. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may obfuscate command-line parameters or use alternate methods to execute similar commands without detection. The rule may fail to catch such evasion techniques, hence a multi-layered detection approach is recommended.

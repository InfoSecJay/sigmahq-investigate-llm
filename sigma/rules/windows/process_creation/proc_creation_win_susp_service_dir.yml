  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Service Binary Directory" detection rule identifies potentially malicious service binaries that are executed from uncommon or suspicious directories within the Windows operating system. The rule focuses on processes created that originate from specific directories often abused by attackers to evade detection and maintain persistence on compromised systems. It looks for processes whose image path contains certain suspicious directories, such as less commonly used user directories and system profile paths, when initiated by trusted Windows services like `services.exe` and `svchost.exe`. This detection is particularly relevant for the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Defense Evasion" (TA0005) and the technique "Service Execution" (T1202). 
  The data sources leveraged by this rule primarily include Windows process creation logs, which provide details about the execution of processes, the paths from which they are loaded, and their parent processes. By monitoring these paths, SOC analysts can detect anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Query EDR for Process Details**: Use the EDR tool to query process details associated with the alert, focusing on the specific binaries flagged in the suspicious directories, and gather context around the execution time and user account involved.
    
  - **Examine Windows Event Logs**: Review Windows Security logs for event IDs related to service creation or modification, particularly around the timestamps of the detected processes to identify any unauthorized service activity.
  - **Check for Anomalous Network Activity**: Utilize the NDR tool to analyze outgoing traffic originating from the alerts to assess any communication with known malicious IPs or domains, which may correlate with the suspicious service activity.
  - **Inspect File System and Registry Changes**: Investigate any recent changes in the filesystem or registry related to the paths identified in the alert to determine if malware payloads or persistence mechanisms have been established.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential risk posed by services running from non-standard directories, which is a common technique used by adversaries to evade detection and maintain persistence on compromised systems. Immediate investigation is recommended to prevent possible exploitation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger if an attacker uses a legitimate binary from a trusted directory or if they manipulate trusted processes to execute malicious binaries outside of the targeted paths. Additionally, if an organization uses alternative logging mechanisms or the logging is misconfigured, it may not capture all relevant process creation events. Analysts should also consider that the detection may generate false positives if legitimate applications are misconfigured to run from these paths.

  ### Technical Context
  The "WMI Backdoor Exchange Transport Agent" Sigma rule is designed to detect the use of a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) backdoor that exploits the Exchange Transport Agents. This method generally seeks to create persistence mechanisms in compromised Exchange Servers, allowing malicious actors to maintain indirect access through WMI event filters. The rule specifically targets process creation logs, examining instances where the parent process is `EdgeTransport.exe`. It further filters out benign processes such as `conhost.exe` and `OleConverter.exe`, mitigating false positives by targeting only suspicious behavior. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of persistence and privilege escalation, particularly under the technique T1546.003, which focuses on the abuse of application-layer architectural features for persistence.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Events:** Review Windows Process Creation logs for instances of suspicious processes initiated by `EdgeTransport.exe` to confirm the alert context.
  - **Analyze WMI Filters:** Utilize WMI query tools to inspect any event filters present within the Exchange Server for signs of unauthorized modifications or backdoors.
  - **Correlate with EDR Data:** Investigate EDR alerts or logs from the affected endpoint to identify any additional malicious activities or lateral movements associated with the alert.
  - **Inspect Security Logs:** Examine relevant Windows Security logs, focusing on logons and other activity surrounding the time of the detected incident to gain insight into potential unauthorized access.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this rule flags critical alerts, the severity level is high due to the potential for long-term persistence and access that can lead to data breaches or total compromise of the Exchange environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where the adversary utilizes alternative persistence mechanisms or if the process `EdgeTransport.exe` is not engaged in malicious behavior (e.g., legitimate admin operations). Additionally, reliance on specific parent process indicators may allow skilled adversaries to bypass detection methods. Analysts should consider evolving attack methodologies and ensure comprehensive logging across environments to avoid missed incidents.

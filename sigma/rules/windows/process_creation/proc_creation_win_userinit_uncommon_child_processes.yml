  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies any uncommon child processes spawned by `userinit.exe`, a Microsoft executable that is typically responsible for user logon initialization in Windows environments. The primary indication of malicious activity is a child process that is unusual and not typically spawned by the legitimate operation of `userinit.exe`. The rule specifically targets processes that do not conform to expected behavior, such as those involving uncommon shell scripts (like `netlogon.bat` or `UsrLogon.cmd`), or the unexpected use of PowerShell as a shell. It references the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1037.001 (Application Layer Protocol: Web Shell) and is designed to surface potential persistence mechanisms exploited by adversaries.
  The rule collects data from Windows process creation logs, paying particular attention to the `ParentImage` field to ensure it identifies child processes initiated specifically from `userinit.exe`. Additional filters are applied to exclude legitimate usage scenarios that could trigger false positives, such as specific command-line arguments and expected image paths of applications that might commonly interact with `userinit.exe`.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the process creation logs and confirm whether any flagged child processes exhibit suspicious characteristics or unrecognized behavior.
  - **Examine Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line arguments associated with the identified processes. Look for unusual patterns or flags that are not typical for a user execution context.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Check logon activity and user behavior using Windows Security logs to determine if the execution of these processes correlates with legitimate user logins or if they appear abnormal.
  - **Assess Impact on Environment:** Utilize network and system data to assess the potential impact of the identified processes, including any associated network connections or file modifications that could indicate further malicious activity.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity because the detection of uncommon child processes from `userinit.exe` can indicate attempts at persistence by an adversary, potentially enabling further access and control over affected systems in an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an attacker employs less common techniques not captured by the filters, such as launching processes after creating new scheduled tasks or using legitimate cloud-based scripts to execute commands. Additionally, legitimate scripts that follow similar patterns may trigger false positives, which is why applying context through user activity logs is crucial. Finally, environments using heavily customized login scripts or alternative user initialization procedures may not trigger this rule effectively.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed MegaSync Execution" detection rule is designed to identify instances where the legitimate MegaSync executable has been renamed and subsequently executed on a Windows system. This behavior has been observed in various ransomware tactics, notably with families such as Nefilim, Sodinokibi, Pysa, and Conti, as a method to evade detection mechanisms. The rule specifically scans process creation logs for executables that claim to have the original file name of "megasync.exe". Utilizing the Windows Sysmon logs, it looks for cases where the file appears to be renamed in the path but is actually executing the binary associated with MegaSync. Implementing this detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques under **Defense Evasion (T1218)**, which outlines how adversaries attempt to bypass security controls by running renamed or impersonated executables.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Sysmon Logs**: Investigate Sysmon's process creation logs for the execution of the `megasync.exe` process, ensuring to analyze the corresponding original file name in the logs.
  - **Analyze Command Line Parameters**: Review the command-line arguments associated with the renamed executable for any suspicious parameters that may indicate malicious intent or behavior.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts**: Use your EDR solution to identify related alerts or anomalous behavior from the system or user executing the renamed MegaSync process.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic**: Review network connection logs related to the execution to identify any potentially malicious outbound connections or communications linked to ransomware activities.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to the significant risk that the execution of a disguised MegaSync application poses, particularly concerning known ransomware variants that utilize this method for deployment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that the identifiers and execution patterns used by both legitimate and malicious instances of MegaSync are not heavily altered by adversaries; however, valid scenarios could lead to false positives. If legitimate software is frequently renamed or if administrators deliberately customize executable names for MegaSync, it may lead to missed detections. Additionally, if an adversary uses a different method to evade detection that does not involve renaming or if they execute variations of malicious code, this rule may not trigger.

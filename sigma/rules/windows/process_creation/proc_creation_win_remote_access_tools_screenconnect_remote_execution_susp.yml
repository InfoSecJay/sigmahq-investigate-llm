  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially suspicious command executions initiated by the ScreenConnect client service, a popular remote access tool. It particularly focuses on identifying unusual child processes spawned from commands that include specific utilities known for their capability to assist in remote command execution. The rule captures data from Windows process creation logs, particularly examining the properties of parent command lines for indicators that processes like `bitsadmin.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `curl.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others are being executed in a suspicious context. By monitoring the command lines that launch these processes, the rule helps identify patterns associated with potential command-and-control (C2) activity, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Command and Control (T1219). 
  In essence, when an instance of the ScreenConnect client service invokes a known potentially harmful utility, this could indicate an attempt to execute malicious commands on the host system. The detection relies on Sysmon telemetry, particularly focusing on process creation events to provide visibility into potentially malicious behaviors that may facilitate unauthorized remote access or exploitation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine EDR Alerts:** Check your EDR for alerts related to the flagged process creations. Look for any anomalous behaviors associated with the ScreenConnect client or the relevant command-line arguments that triggered the alert.
    
  - **Review Process Trees:** Utilize EDR to review the process tree originating from the detected parent process. Investigate any child processes spawned from `ScreenConnect` and their command-line parameters for further clues.
  - **Search Proxy Logs:** Analyze proxy logs for any outbound connections made around the time of the suspicious command execution. This may reveal unexpected C2 communications or data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Investigate Network Behavior:** Using NDR, review any unusual network traffic patterns correlating with the execution times of the suspicious commands. Pay particular attention to connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level for this alert is reasoned based on the potential for denial of service and information theft that can arise from unauthorized remote command execution, making it crucial for timely investigation. While not immediately catastrophic, the risk associated with Remote Access Tools warrants prompt attention to mitigate potential breaches.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the executed commands do not include the specified utilities or if the ScreenConnect service operates without triggering any suspicious activity in the monitored logs. Additionally, if the command execution is obscured within legitimate workflows, it may evade detection. Further, the rule assumes that the relevant telemetry from Sysmon is appropriately configured and collected. Attackers might also attempt to obfuscate their command lines, using techniques such as string encoding or custom scripts to bypass detection.

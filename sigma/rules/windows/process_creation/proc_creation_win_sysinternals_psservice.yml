  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Sysinternals PsService Execution" is designed to identify the execution of the PsService tool, part of the Sysinternals suite developed by Microsoft. PsService allows users to view and control services on local or remote systems. Although it can be used legitimately by administrators for service management, it can also be exploited by attackers for reconnaissance and tampering with services on compromised systems. This rule specifically looks for process creation events that include the original file name 'psservice.exe' or variations of its path. The detection relies on process creation logs, which detail the initiation of executable files, including command-line parameters and the parent processes that triggered the execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review process creation logs in the EDR to confirm the execution of PsService, noting the time, user, and originating host for context.
  - Analyze the command-line parameters used with PsService in the process logs to identify any suspicious or unauthorized actions, such as attempts to stop or modify services.
  - Cross-reference the user account associated with the PsService execution against your user access policy to determine whether it aligns with expected administrator actions.
  - Check for any related network connections or outbound traffic using NDR and firewall logs to see if the execution corresponds with any unusual activity that may indicate a broader security incident.

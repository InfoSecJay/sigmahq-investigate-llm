  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies the execution of Sysinternals ADExplorer, a tool commonly used for interacting with the Active Directory database, when it is run with the "-snapshot" flag. This flag can potentially create a local copy of sensitive directory information, making it a valuable target for credential access attacks. The rule relies primarily on process creation logs, analyzing both the image name (ensuring it matches `ADExplorer.exe`) and the command-line arguments to detect the usage of the snapshot feature. The related MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques include **Credential Access** (T1552.001) and **Exploitation for Credential Access** (T1003.003), which highlight the concern of unauthorized entities potentially gathering sensitive information via this method.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Analyze process creation logs in your EDR to identify instances of `ADExplorer.exe` being invoked. Focus on the associated command-line parameters to confirm the presence of the `-snapshot` flag.
  - **Check User Context:** Investigate the user account that launched ADExplorer. Confirm whether this account has legitimate access rights and evaluate whether it appears in any prior suspicious activities.
  - **Audit Active Directory Changes:** Utilize AD logs to inspect any changes made around the time the ADExplorer was executed. Pay attention to entries which may suggest unauthorized attempts to access or modify AD objects.
  - **Examine Related Network Activity:** Look into network connection logs, and confirm whether there is any unusual network activity correlating with the execution of ADExplorer. This can help identify if the data was exfiltrated or accessed outside of normal parameters.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is rated as medium severity due to the sensitive nature of Active Directory data. Unauthorized use of ADExplorer can indicate a potential breach or insider threat, necessitating prompt investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that ADExplorer is invoked on a Windows system that employs Sysmon for process monitoring. It may not fire if ADExplorer is executed with different binary names or command-line arguments. Additionally, if the tool is run from an environment with limited logging capabilities or by users with elevated privileges under legitimate circumstances, the detection could be evaded. Understanding the typical usage patterns of administrative tools within the environment is crucial to prevent false negatives.

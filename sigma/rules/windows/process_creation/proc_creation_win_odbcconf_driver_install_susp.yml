description: Detects execution of "odbcconf" with the "INSTALLDRIVER" action where
  the driver doesn't contain a ".dll" extension. This is often used as a defense evasion
  method.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule aims to identify potentially malicious activities involving the Windows utility `odbcconf.exe`, which is often exploited by attackers to install drivers that are not legitimate or trusted. Specifically, the rule detects the usage of `odbcconf.exe` with the `INSTALLDRIVER` action when the specified driver file does not have a `.dll` file extension. In many cases, this behavior is associated with evasion tactics that adversaries employ to hide their activities, such as impersonating legitimate processes or using benign tools for malicious purposes. The relevant technical data sources for this detection include process creation logs from Sysmon, which provide insights into executed commands and their parameters, making it possible to identify and respond to unusual or suspicious activities. This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under Defense Evasion (T1218.008).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review the EDR Console:** Check the EDR for any alerts or logs related to the execution of `odbcconf.exe`. Look for unusual command-line arguments or context that may suggest malicious intent.
    
  - **Examine Process Tree:** Use EDR tools to map the process tree to identify whether `odbcconf.exe` was spawned by a known legitimate application or was initiated by another suspicious process.
    
  - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Cross-reference with Windows Event Logs (Security and Sysmon) to see if any other related activities (such as file operations or device changes) coincide with the execution of `odbcconf.exe`.
    
  - **Check Driver Signing:** Use Windows driver logs to verify the authenticity and signing status of the drivers being installed. Unsigned drivers or those from untrusted sources represent a significant risk.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as high severity due to its potential implications for system integrity and security. Unauthorized driver installations can facilitate advanced threats such as rootkits or persistent backdoors, undermining the overall security posture of the enterprise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in environments where `odbcconf.exe` has been exempted from monitoring or in cases where attackers utilize different methods or tools for driver installation. Moreover, legitimate usage of `odbcconf.exe` for standard application support might lead to false negatives if the condition criteria are inadvertently met. Understanding the context in which `odbcconf.exe` is used is crucial; otherwise, the alert could miss instances of rogue behavior camouflaged as typical operations.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious execution patterns of `wuauclt.exe`, the Windows Update Client binary, which can be exploited by adversaries for proxy execution as part of a broader attack framework. It focuses on identifying process creation events that involve specific command-line parameters indicating potential malicious behavior. The rule leverages process creation logs, analyzing paths, original filenames, and various command-line arguments associated with `wuauclt.exe`. Given the nature of the detection, it relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218 (System Climate) under the tactics of Defense Evasion and Execution. By assessing these parameters, security teams can uncover attempts to misuse legitimate Windows processes to carry out unauthorized actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Review the relevant Windows Security logs for process creation events that display `wuauclt.exe` in the image field with the specified command-line parameters to confirm malicious execution.
  - **Correlate with EDR Alerts:** Utilize EDR tools to analyze the behavior of the process, check for associated file modifications, or network connections that may indicate further malicious activity.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Investigate the command-line arguments passed to `wuauclt.exe`, specifically looking for patterns indicating misuse, such as the presence of `UpdateDeploymentProvider` or any references to malicious DLLs.
  - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Check outbound connections triggered by `wuauclt.exe` in NDR or firewall logs to ensure they're legitimate and not indicative of exfiltration or communication with known bad actors.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as high severity due to the potential for misuse of a trusted Windows process, which could indicate an advanced persistent threat (APT) leveraging stealth methods to execute malicious actions under the guise of legitimate system functionality.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  - This rule may not fire if the malicious actor modifies the command-line arguments or attempts to obfuscate the execution path of `wuauclt.exe` or utilizes other update services that do not trigger this detection.
  - There is an assumption that `wuauclt.exe` will be executed in environments where it is actively monitored; if the agent monitoring Sysmon logs is not deployed or configured properly, relevant telemetry may be missed.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Network Command" detection rule identifies potential reconnaissance activities where adversaries gather information about the network configuration of a system. Specifically, the rule looks for process creation events that contain specific command-line arguments typically used for network configuration discovery. Commands such as `ipconfig /all`, `netsh interface show interface`, `arp -a`, `nbtstat -n`, `net config`, and `route print` are targeted because they provide detailed insights into active network interfaces, routing tables, and additional configuration settings. The rule leverages data from Windows process creation logs, which are part of Sysmon telemetry to track executed commands and their parameters. This behavior aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Discovery" (T1016), highlighting the importance of monitoring for potential reconnaissance activities conducted by attackers.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Creation Logs:** Check the Windows process creation logs in Sysmon or EDR tools for instances of the suspicious commands listed in the Sigma rule, focusing on the command-line parameters used. 
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Investigate the context of the command execution by looking for associated user activity around the same time to determine if the command was executed by a legitimate user or an unauthorized entity.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use network traffic analysis tools to review outgoing connections and DNS queries that may correspond with the command execution, looking for any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Check for Elevation of Privileges:** If an administrative or elevated context was used to run the commands, ensure to check the logs for any related activities that could indicate privilege escalation malicious behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as low severity due to the potential for benign uses, particularly in administrative contexts. However, consistent patterns of such commands in unexpected places should prompt closer scrutiny, as they may indicate preparatory steps for a more extensive exploitation attempt.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if an adversary uses alternate methods or custom scripts to retrieve network information, bypassing the typical commands monitored. Additionally, if legitimate users frequently execute these commands for routine maintenance, false positives may arise. The assumption is that all devices are correctly configured to log process creation events and that the SIEM or monitoring tools are adequately capturing this telemetry. In environments without Sysmon deployed, or where less verbose logging is enabled, these critical events may go unnoticed.

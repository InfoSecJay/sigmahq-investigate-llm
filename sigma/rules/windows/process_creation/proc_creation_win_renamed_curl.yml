  ### Technical Context
  The "Renamed CURL.EXE Execution" detection rule identifies instances where a modified or renamed version of the CURL executable is run on Windows systems. This detection leverages information from process creation logs, specifically focusing on the original filename and description fields of the PE (Portable Executable) metadata. The rule aims to uncover potential execution of CURL that may have been renamed as part of a malicious evasion technique, which is often used to bypass basic security controls. By monitoring for processes that contain "curl" in their image path but do not match traditional attributes for legitimate CURL executions, analysts can detect anomalous activity. This detection relates to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) and T1202 (Indirect Command Execution), illustrating how threats can exploit legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Process Details:** Check the details of the detected process in the EDR tool, focusing on the original filename and description to confirm whether it matches 'curl.exe' or similar malicious variants. 
  - **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Review the command-line parameters associated with the executed process to determine its intent and to identify any suspicious or uncommon usage scenarios.
  - **Correlate with Network Activity:** Utilize network logs and proxy data to assess any outbound connections made by the identified CURL execution to discern whether malicious data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication occurred.
  - **Inspect for Parent Processes:** Investigate the parent process of the CURL execution to determine if it was spawned by a potentially malicious application or script, which may indicate a deeper compromise.
  ### Prioritization
  A medium severity level is assigned to this alert due to the potential for legitimate application usage, but also the capability for adversaries to misuse such tools for nefarious activities. As CURL is commonly utilized for legitimate HTTP requests, distinguishing between benign and malicious executions is crucial in an enterprise setting.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if threat actors utilize additional obfuscation techniques or if altered attributes in the PE metadata are undetected. Additionally, if users or software legitimately rename CURL for benign reasons, it could result in false positives. It is important to assume that variations in file paths and naming conventions employed by adversaries may elude detection, indicating the need for continuous adjustment and improvement of detection capabilities.

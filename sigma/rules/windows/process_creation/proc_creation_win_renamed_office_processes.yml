  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious activity involving the execution of Microsoft Office application binaries that have been renamed. The rule targets the following commonly exploited Office applications: Excel, Access, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Word. By monitoring `process_creation` logs, the rule checks for process instances that utilize the original filenames of these Office applications (e.g., `Excel.exe`, `MSACCESS.EXE`) while filtering out known legitimate paths and file names. Specifically, it requires that the `OriginalFileName` of the created process matches known Office executables and that the process creation does not originate from typical legitimate paths associated with these executables. The rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for defense evasion, as adversaries often rename benign applications to obfuscate their malicious actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Utilize Windows Event Logs for process creation events to find instances of Office executables that exhibit suspicious naming or behavior. Verify the `OriginalFileName` and the file path for anomalies.
  - **Examine Parent Processes:** Investigate the parent processes associated with the identified Office binaries. This can provide context about how the potentially renamed process was initiated, helping to confirm or refute malicious intent.
  - **Review Associated Command-line Parameters:** Analyze command-line arguments used during the execution of the identified processes. Malicious actors may employ unusual flags or parameters that deviate from standard usage patterns.
  - **Conduct Threat Intelligence Lookup:** Cross-reference the detected process names and paths with threat intelligence databases to identify whether they have been previously associated with malicious activities or known threats.
  ### Prioritization
  The high severity level assigned to this alert signifies that the execution of a renamed Office binary is a potential indicator of a deliberate evasion technique used by adversaries. Given the prominence of Microsoft Office files in enterprise environments, any alert related to their execution warrants immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not function effectively in environments where legitimate processes are frequently renamed or where software development practices utilize obscure naming conventions. Additionally, custom scripts or automation tools that obfuscate their command-line executions could bypass detection. Analysts should be aware that sophisticated adversaries may utilize additional methods, such as file-less malware techniques, to execute malicious actions without invoking traditional process creation logs.

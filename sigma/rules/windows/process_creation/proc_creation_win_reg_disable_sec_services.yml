  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying potential attempts to disable security services in Windows environments via the use of the `reg.exe` command-line utility. Specifically, the rule monitors for the execution of commands that add registry keys that would change the startup type of critical services associated with Windows security, such as Windows Defender. The rule looks for processes created with command-line parameters indicating the use of `reg` to add keys related to service control and critical security components. It utilizes logs from process creation as its primary data source, ensuring that any suspicious registry modifications aimed at compromising security can be flagged for further investigation. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques referenced are under the tactic "Defense Evasion," specifically technique T1562.001, which pertains to disabling security tools.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Creation Logs:** Review Windows process creation logs for instances of `reg.exe` with the associated command-line parameters that match the detection criteria. Validate the context in which `reg.exe` was executed.
  - **Examine Security Event Logs:** Inspect Windows Security event logs for any related security incidents around the same time, specifically looking for successful or failed attempts to modify security services.
  - **Utilize EDR Tools:** Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to examine the endpoint's state and confirm whether the listed security services (e.g., Windows Defender) are currently running or have been altered.
  - **Review User Activity:** Investigate the user account that executed the command for any suspicious activity patterns or known malicious affiliations. Cross-reference against proxy logs or VPN activity to ascertain the user's login context.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to the critical nature of the services involved, as their disabling can expose systems to significant vulnerabilities and possible exploitation by malicious actors.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule assumes that the necessary telemetry from process creation logs is available; however, it may not fire if the adversary employs techniques that evade logging or if the `reg.exe` command is executed in a manner not covered by the criteria (e.g., using alternative tools or scripts). Additionally, legitimate system maintenance tasks or administrative scripts that modify service states could lead to false negatives or false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential SPN Enumeration Via Setspn.EXE" is designed to detect potentially malicious activity that involves the enumeration of Service Principal Names (SPNs) through the execution of the `setspn.exe` command-line utility. SPN enumeration is a method commonly leveraged by attackers during the Kerberoasting technique (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Credential Access, Technique T1558.003), which seeks to identify service accounts utilized within an Active Directory environment. By querying SPNs, attackers can identify services configured to use Kerberos, enabling them to extract service tickets for potential offline cracking.
  This rule identifies two key components: **process creation logs** that specifically capture the execution of `setspn.exe`, and **command-line parameters** indicating enumeration queries (notably, those containing `-q` or `/q`). Thus, by monitoring these activities, security teams can identify and respond to potentially unauthorized SPN enumeration that could lead to credential theft and privilege escalation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Execution Logs:** Investigate recent process creation logs for instances of `setspn.exe` execution to determine if the context of the operation aligns with legitimate administrative activities.
  - **Analyze Command-Line Parameters:** Check the command-line arguments used with `setspn.exe`. Queries containing `-q` or `/q` warrant a deeper inspection, especially when executed by non-administrative accounts.
  - **Cross-reference User Accounts:** Utilize user activity logs from Active Directory to verify whether the user executing the command has legitimate administrative rights and whether the command aligns with their expected behavior.
  - **Inspect Related Network Activity:** Use EDR or network logs to check for any subsequent connections or requests to Kerberos services that correlate with the suspicious execution of `setspn.exe`.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is set to medium due to the fact that while SPN enumeration can be a legitimate administrative task, it is frequently exploited in attack scenarios to facilitate unauthorized access and privilege escalation. This necessitates timely investigation to mitigate potential risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  It is important to note that this rule may not capture legitimate administrative actions performed by authorized personnel who may also use `setspn.exe` for routine tasks. Furthermore, if the enumeration process is conducted via alternate, less scrutinized methods or tools that do not utilize `setspn.exe`, the detection will fail. Attackers may also obfuscate their activities using benign tools with altered names or hidden command-line parameters, which can avoid triggering this detection.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious parent processes associated with well-known Windows system processes, such as `svchost.exe`, `taskhost.exe`, `lsass.exe`, and others. It analyzes the process creation logs to identify instances where these critical Windows components are initiated with potentially malicious parent processes. The detection leverages Windows Event Logs categorized under process creation, particularly focusing on the relationships between processes through their parent-child hierarchies. By examining the parent process names and paths (especially those associated with common security tools), the rule flags potential exploitation or evasion techniques used by adversaries, referencing the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1036.003 (Masquerading: Rename Same File) and T1036.005 (Masquerading: Path Interception).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Hierarchy:** Investigate the specific process creation event in your EDR solution to analyze the parent-child process relationships and determine if the parent is anomalous compared to organizational norms.
  - **Review Network Activity:** Utilize your NDR tools to inspect any suspicious outgoing network connections from the flagged processes, looking for unusual destinations or patterns that diverge from normal behavior.
  - **Analyze Associated Logs:** Examine security, application, and system logs to gain context around the process execution, including user account activities and other related events that may indicate compromise.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Compare the flagged parent processes against threat intelligence databases to identify known malicious signatures or behaviors associated with the detected process hierarchy.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that the alert indicates potential unauthorized or suspicious behavior of critical Windows system processes, it should be considered a medium priority for investigation due to the potential implications of process tampering or evasion techniques.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where legitimate applications employ similar process hierarchies or if certain security software that benignly spawns these parent processes is present. Additionally, the rule assumes that the telemetry from Windows Event Logs is comprehensive and that the logging level is configured correctly to capture all relevant events. Adversaries may also employ techniques to obfuscate or alter process names, leading to missed detections.

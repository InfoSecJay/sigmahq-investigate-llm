  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors the execution of the `Tpmvscmgr.exe` process, which is responsible for managing virtual smart cards on Windows systems. Specifically, the rule looks for instances where this executable is run with a command line containing the word "create", indicating an attempt to create a new virtual smart card. The primary data source involved in this detection is process creation logs, specifically utilizing information from Windows Sysmon to capture the execution of the process, its command line arguments, and its file attributes. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of execution (TA0002), targeting techniques that involve executing commands or scripts on a host.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Execution:** Review the process creation logs in EDR to determine if `Tpmvscmgr.exe` was executed on the affected system and verify the user context under which it was run.
  - **Inspect Command Line Arguments:** Analyze the command line parameters associated with `Tpmvscmgr.exe` to confirm if "create" appears, which indicates an action to create a virtual smart card.
  - **Cross-reference Time and User Activity:** Use proxy logs and VPN access logs to understand if there were unusual activities from the corresponding user account around the time the process was triggered.
  - **Assess Environmental Context:** Consult with security baselines and configurations for the enterprise to evaluate if the legitimate use of virtual smart cards is consistent with the user profile and expected operational behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for misuse of the `Tpmvscmgr.exe` process, which could indicate unauthorized virtual smart card creation potentially leading to access escalation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The detection rule may not fire if `Tpmvscmgr.exe` is executed without the "create" command in the command line, or if the necessary Sysmon logging is not implemented on endpoints. Additionally, legitimate activity by an authorized administrator could result in false positives, requiring appropriate contextual data from security baselines. It is assumed that all necessary telemetry is available; if certain logs are not collected, the rule's effectiveness could be hampered.

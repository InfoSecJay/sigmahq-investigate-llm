  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Potential Process Hollowing Activity" is designed to identify potential process hollowing, a technique used by attackers to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. The rule works by analyzing the properties of running processes using Windows Sysmon logs, particularly focusing on cases where the in-memory image of a process differs from its corresponding image on disk. The key indicators include processes located in typical system directories or certain applications indicating an attempted modification or replacement, which are common behaviors associated with process hollowing. The rule leverages information from Sysmon's process tampering telemetry to catch these discrepancies, specifically looking for evidence that suggests a malicious actor has altered a process with malicious intent.
  This detection aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of 'Defense Evasion' and 'Privilege Escalation', specifically targeting the technique T1055.012 (Process Injection). Process hollowing can be particularly dangerous as it allows an attacker to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes while executing their own code in memory.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Sysmon Logs:** Examine Sysmon process creation and process tampering logs for any events where the image in memory does not match the stored disk image, especially those originating from common directories like `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Windows\System32`.
  - **Analyze EDR Alerts:** Use your endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution to investigate the processes identified by the Sigma rule. Look for unusual behavior associated with these processes, such as unexpected network connections or suspicious command-line arguments.
  - **Check Antivirus Logs:** Query your AV solution for any detections related to the processes flagged by Sysmon. This may provide additional context or confirm whether the files examined have a known malicious signature.
  - **Investigate Network Activity:** Utilize network device logs (e.g., from NDR or NGFW) to look for network connections made by the identified processes. Check if these processes are communicating with known malicious IP addresses or domains.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert generated by this rule should be considered medium severity due to the potential for significant escalation of privileges if process hollowing is successfully executed. Detecting this behavior early is critical to preventing unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several assumptions and limitations related to this rule's effectiveness:
  - **False Positives:** There may be legitimate scenarios that cause mismatches in the memory and disk images, leading to false positives. Applications that inherently modify their executables after launch may trigger these alerts.
  - **Targeting Specific Processes:** The rule is designed to focus on well-known application paths (like Opera and Microsoft Edge), which may lead to undiscovered hollowing activities in other less common applications.
  - **Sysmon Configuration:** The effectiveness of this detection relies heavily on proper Sysmon configuration and the logging of critical events. If logging is insufficient or misconfigured, the rule may not fire.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where svchost.exe, which is often used by Windows services, is hosting remote desktop protocol (RDP) sessions established on the default RDP port (TCP 3389) and making outbound network connections to HTTP (TCP 80) or HTTPS (TCP 443) target ports. Such behavior may indicate an attempt to tunnel RDP sessions through these common web ports, potentially evading network defenses while facilitating malicious lateral movement or command-and-control communications. The rule utilizes Windows network connection logs to monitor outbound traffic and cross-references the specific conditions under which the svchost.exe process operates. This is associated with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, notably Command and Control (T1572) and Lateral Movement (T1021.001).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts for devices that triggered this rule, focusing on svchost.exe's execution context to identify any unusual processes or activities associated with the event.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use network traffic analysis tools to capture and inspect packets related to the identified connections to HTTP/HTTPS ports. Look for strange or unexpected destinations.
  - **Examine Windows Event Logs:** Investigate Windows Security and System event logs for related RDP activities, such as logon events or session creation to corroborate the connection from svchost.exe.
  - **Audit Recent Changes:** Review any recent changes to firewall or proxy settings that might have allowed this behavior, and ensure any organizational policies regarding RDP access and tunneling are still enforced.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level is high as the detection of RDP sessions tunneling through common HTTP/HTTPS ports can signify a significant security risk, possibly indicating attempts to bypass network security mechanisms for lateral movement or establishing command-and-control pathways.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if RDP sessions are established through non-standard ports or if svchost.exe is not present during the session. Additionally, if adversaries use signed legitimate processes or other obfuscation techniques, the rule may fail to trigger. It's important to assume that well-resourced attackers may employ techniques to evade detection; hence, itâ€™s critical to maintain a layered security approach to complement alerting mechanisms.

  Detects outbound network connection initiated by Microsoft Dialer.
  The Microsoft Dialer, also known as Phone Dialer, is a built-in utility application included in various versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Its primary function is to provide users with a graphical interface for managing phone calls via a modem or a phone line connected to the computer.
  This is an outdated process in the current conext of it's usage and is a common target for info stealers for process injection, and is used to make C2 connections, common example is "Rhadamanthys"

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule titled "Outbound Network Connection Initiated By Microsoft Dialer" is designed to detect suspicious outbound network connections initiated by the `dialer.exe` application, a legacy utility found in various versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Although its primary purpose is to facilitate telephone calls via modems or connected phone lines, `dialer.exe` is an outdated application that can become a target for malware, particularly information stealers. These malicious actors may exploit this utility for process injection or use it to establish command and control (C2) connections. The rule leverages network connection logs to identify instances where `dialer.exe` initiates outbound connections, excluding known local ranges to prevent false positives from legitimate internal traffic. This rule is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under tactic `Execution` and technique `T1071.001`, reflecting its potential misuse by adversaries to exfiltrate data or establish unauthorized communications.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Process Details:** Verify the occurrence of `dialer.exe` in the EDR logs and check the process creation details to confirm its origin and behavior.
  - **Analyze Network Connections:** Use network monitoring tools to inspect outbound traffic associated with `dialer.exe`, focusing on unusual external IP addresses or unexpected communication patterns.
  - **Correlate with User Activity:** Examine user account activity and login history around the time of the connection to assess whether it aligns with legitimate user behavior or if it appears anomalous.
  - **Check for Malware Indicators:** Utilize threat intelligence feeds and AV/EDR solutions to identify any known indicators of compromise related to the detected `dialer.exe` activity, particularly looking for associations with known information stealers.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is prioritized as high severity due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized outbound communications initiated by a legacy application, which could indicate an active compromise aimed at data exfiltration or C2 activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule assumes that `dialer.exe` should not be legitimate in modern enterprise environments, which may not hold true for all organizations. There may be instances where organizations have specific use cases for this application, potentially leading to false positives. Additionally, if an adversary utilizes an alternative method to establish outbound connections without involving `dialer.exe`, the rule may fail to trigger. Analysts should also consider the potential for malware to masquerade as this legitimate application, making it essential to review the integrity of the file path and signature.

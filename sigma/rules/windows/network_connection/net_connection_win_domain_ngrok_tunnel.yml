  Detects an executable initiating a network connection to "ngrok" tunneling domains.
  Attackers were seen using this "ngrok" in order to store their second stage payloads and malware.
  While communication with such domains can be legitimate, often times is a sign of either data exfiltration by malicious actors or additional download.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect when executables initiate network connections to ngrok tunneling domains. Ngrok is a service that enables users to expose local servers to the internet securely, but it can also be misused by attackers to establish command-and-control channels or to exfiltrate data covertly. The rule analyzes network connection logs from Windows systems focusing on connections targeting specific ngrok domains (e.g., `tunnel.us.ngrok.com`, `tunnel.eu.ngrok.com`). When an executable attempts to communicate with these domains, it raises an alert. This activity is particularly concerning as it could indicate malicious behavior, including the transfer of sensitive information or the retrieval of second-stage payloads. This detection is relevant to multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics such as Exfiltration (T1567), Command and Control (T1090), and Remote Service (T1572), reflecting the versatility of ngrok for both benign and nefarious purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check network traffic:** Review network connection logs in your network security tools to identify the source process and its associated executable that initiated communication with the ngrok domains.
  - **Analyze process behavior:** Utilize EDR tools to investigate the process that attempted the connection, looking for unusual behavior or any prior indicators of compromise related to that executable.
  - **Review user activity logs:** Examine the user activity logs to assess whether the user or process involved had legitimate reasons for interacting with ngrok, particularly in the context of remote work or application debugging.
  - **Correlate with threat intelligence:** Cross-reference the alert with known threat intelligence feeds and previous incidents to determine if this specific activity aligns with any documented use of ngrok by threat actors.
  ### Prioritization
  Given the potential for serious data exfiltration or the establishment of a covert command-and-control channel, this alert is categorized as high severity. Immediate investigation is warranted to mitigate risks to organizational data and systems.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in the following scenarios: legitimate use of ngrok by authorized personnel, insufficient monitoring of outbound network traffic, or if the traffic is encrypted or obfuscated. Additionally, if an attacker uses alternate tunneling solutions or proxies that do not include ngrok domains, the detection will not trigger. Responders should also be aware that skilled adversaries may find ways to bypass this detection by using less conspicuous domains.

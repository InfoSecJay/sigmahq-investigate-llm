id: 7e9cf7b6-e827-11ed-a05b-0242ac120003
status: experimental
description: |

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect potentially suspicious non-browser processes that are communicating with Google API endpoints, which may indicate the use of covert command and control (C2) mechanisms such as GC2-sheet. The ruleâ€™s detection logic utilizes network connection logs to identify processes attempting to reach specific Google API domains, including `drive.googleapis.com`, `oauth2.googleapis.com`, and `sheets.googleapis.com`. The rule specifies exclusions for known legitimate browser images and applications such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Google Drive, ensuring that only non-browser process communications trigger an alert. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactic of "Command and Control" (T1102), which highlights the concern regarding unauthorized data exfiltration or receiving commands using public services.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Identify the Process**: Using EDR tools, review the details of the identified process that triggered the alert, including the process name, path, and associated parent processes.
  - **Network Analysis**: Inspect inbound and outbound network connections related to the triggering process using NDR tools to determine the destination IP and any unexpected connections.
  - **Endpoint Review**: Check Windows Event Logs (Security, Sysmon) for any unusual activity from the identified process, paying close attention to process creation and command-line parameters.
  - **User Context**: Correlate the event with user account activity within SIEM, checking for known compromised accounts or unusually privileged account behaviors.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level of this alert indicates a moderate level of risk, suggesting that while the activity could result from benign applications, the potential for malicious use, particularly with respect to covert C2 operations, warrants prompt investigation.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule assumes that all legitimate browser processes have been adequately excluded and that relevant network communications are accurately logged and monitored. It may not trigger if a malicious process uses obfuscation techniques to disguise its legitimate functions or if the endpoint lacks comprehensive telemetry coverage. Additionally, it may miss communications that do not involve the specified Google API domains, hence the need for continuous tuning and monitoring for other potentially malicious endpoints.

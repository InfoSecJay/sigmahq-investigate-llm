  Detects network connections to Cloudflared tunnels domains initiated by a process on the system.
  Attackers can abuse that feature to establish a reverse shell or persistence on a machine.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies network connections established by processes on a Windows system to known Cloudflared tunnel domains such as `.v2.argotunnel.com`, `protocol-v2.argotunnel.com`, and `trycloudflare.com`. Attackers may exploit Cloudflared's capability to establish secure tunnels for malicious purposes, including creating reverse shells or maintaining persistent access to compromised systems. The rule specifically looks for instances where the connection is initiated (`Initiated: 'true'`) to flag potential unauthorized usage. Relevant data sources include network connection logs that capture attempts made by processes to reach specific domains, enabling SOC analysts to identify potentially harmful external communication. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1567.001, focusing on command and control through potential data exfiltration pathways.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the EDR for any alerts related to the detected process or IP addresses that correspond to the identified Cloudflared tunnel domains. Look for unusual behaviors such as unexpected child processes that might indicate malicious intentions.
    
  - **Examine Process Creation Logs:** Investigate the process creation logs in Sysmon, focusing on the processes that initiated the network connections. Pay particular attention to command-line arguments, as these can provide context on how the processes are interacting with the network.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize network detection and response (NDR) tools to capture and analyze traffic associated with the flagged connections. Determine if there are any anomalies or secondary communication patterns that might suggest data exfiltration or command and control activities.
  - **Inspect Firewall Logs:** Check the logs from the next-generation firewall (NGFW) to confirm the destination IP addresses and relate them to known malicious indicators. This can help assess whether the communication is legitimate or part of a larger attack vector.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is classified as medium severity due to the potential for abuse by attackers utilizing Cloudflared tunnels, which can compromise network security. The alert should be investigated promptly to determine if malicious activity is taking place in the environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in scenarios where legitimate applications use Cloudflare tunnels for valid reasons, leading to false positives. There is an assumption that monitoring of outbound connections is comprehensive; if certain traffic is routed through a proxy or encrypted in a way that masks the destination, the rule may not capture those activities. Additionally, if an adversary employs custom domains or alternative tunneling protocols, this detection may fail to trigger, underscoring the need for a layered security approach.

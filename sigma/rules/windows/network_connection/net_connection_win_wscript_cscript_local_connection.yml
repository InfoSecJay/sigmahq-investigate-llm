  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Local Network Connection Initiated By Script Interpreter" is designed to identify scenarios where a script interpreter, specifically `Wscript.exe` or `Cscript.exe`, initiates a local network connection. This type of behavior may indicate an attempt to download or execute malicious scripts from a shared folder, utilizing local network resources for malicious purposes. The detection primarily uses network connection logs that capture details about outbound connections made by these script interpreters, focusing on specific local IP ranges associated with private networks and loopback addresses. This relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1105 (Remote File Copy) within the command-and-control tactic, as the alert signals potential unauthorized script execution within the local environment that could facilitate lateral movement or payload execution.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Source of the Script Interpreter:** Check the originating device and the user account that executed the `Wscript.exe` or `Cscript.exe`. Analyze the process creation logs to gather additional context about the execution environment.
    
  - **Inspect Network Connections:** Utilize EDR logs to evaluate the details of the network connections established by the script interpreters. Confirm whether the destinations are legitimate services or shared folders within the network.
  - **Analyze the Scripts Involved:** Review any scripts the interpreter attempted to execute or download. If available, correlate these with existing threat intelligence to assess their potential malicious nature.
  - **Check for Anomalous User Behavior:** Investigate the user associated with the execution of the script interpreter. Look for patterns of unusual or unauthorized activity in user behavior logs, especially if these patterns indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is tagged as medium severity, indicating that while this behavior may arise from legitimate scripts, the context of local network connections initiated by script interpreters often presents an elevated risk of malicious activity within an enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the script interpreters are not used to initiate connections, which can happen if the processes are elevated or directly executed via other means (e.g., remote command execution). Additionally, legitimate administrative scripts that perform tasks involving network connections could result in false positives, especially in environments with frequent legitimate use of scripts. An adversary may bypass this detection by executing scripts through alternative methods that do not utilize the recognized interpreters or by disguising their scripts to resemble benign tasks.

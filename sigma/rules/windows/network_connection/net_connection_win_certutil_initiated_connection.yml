  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule for detecting "Uncommon Network Connection Initiated By Certutil.EXE" is designed to identify potentially malicious activities where the legitimate Windows utility `certutil.exe` is used to establish network connections. This utility can be abused by attackers for various malicious tasks such as downloading malware or executing additional payloads. The detection is based on the monitoring of network connections initiated by this executable, focusing specifically on suspicious destination ports commonly associated with command-and-control (C2) communications (such as ports 80, 135, 443, and 445). The relevant technical data sources for this rule include network connection logs that record details about processes establishing outgoing connections. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1105, which focuses on the use of external remote services for command-and-control purposes.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Network Connection Logs:** Use your network detection and response (NDR) solutions to review network connection logs and identify the source IP addresses and destination endpoints associated with the alert.
    
  - **Examine EDR Alerts:** Investigate any corresponding endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts related to `certutil.exe` on affected systems, focusing on the execution context and command-line parameters.
    
  - **Review Process Tree:** Analyze the process tree on the system where `certutil.exe` was executed to determine if there are any suspicious parent processes or other related activities that could indicate malicious behavior.
    
  - **Analyze Proxy Logs:** Inspect the proxy logs to find any outbound requests from the affected system to the identified destination hosts, especially for unexpected connections or file downloads.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to the potential misuse of a built-in Windows tool to establish unauthorized communications, signaling possible malicious activities such as data exfiltration or malware download.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if `certutil.exe` is used in a benign context or if an adversary employs obfuscation techniques to mask their activities. Additionally, it assumes that network connection telemetry is being captured effectively. There is also a risk of false negatives if legitimate network activities involving `certutil.exe` occur over the specified ports without raising alarms.

description: |
  Detects an executable initiating a network connection to "ngrok" domains.
  Attackers were seen using this "ngrok" in order to store their second stage payloads and malware.
  While communication with such domains can be legitimate, often times is a sign of either data exfiltration by malicious actors or additional download.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies when any executable on a Windows system initiates a network connection to domains associated with ngrok, a service often misused by attackers for establishing remote access or exfiltrating data. The rule specifically checks the `DestinationHostname` field against a list of known ngrok domain endings, which typically include variants like `.ngrok.app` and `.ngrok-free.dev`. The underlying data source for this detection is network connection logs, which capture outbound connections made by processes along with their attributes. By leveraging this telemetry, analysts can identify potentially malicious activity consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK technique for data exfiltration (T1567.001). Ngrokâ€™s legitimate usage in testing and development makes it essential for analysts to approach alerts with a balanced assessment of context.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Details:** Review the originating process details using EDR tools to identify which executable initiated the connection and its command-line parameters, which may reveal unintended execution or unusual behavior.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Utilize network monitoring tools to examine the network traffic and determine the nature of the data being sent to the ngrok domain, ensuring it aligns with legitimate company activities.
  - **Review User and Asset Context:** Investigate the user account associated with the process to confirm if it aligns with expected operational behavior or if it indicates compromised credentials.
  - **Contact Application Owners:** If the process is legitimate, coordinate with the application owners or developers to confirm whether the use of ngrok was intentional and to ensure compliance with security policies.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be prioritized as high due to the potential for data exfiltration or malware delivery associated with ngrok domains, which poses significant risks to enterprise security. 
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Analysts should be aware that this rule may generate false positives in scenarios of legitimate ngrok usage for development purposes, which could obscure actual threats. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries might use domain fronting techniques or other rapid domain changes to evade detection. This detection may also fail to trigger if the malicious actor employs DNS tunneling or obscure domains not listed in the current detection thresholds.

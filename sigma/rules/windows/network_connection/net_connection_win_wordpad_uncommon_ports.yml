title: Suspicious Wordpad Outbound Connections
id: 786cdae8-fefb-4eb2-9227-04e34060db01
status: test
description: |
  Detects a network connection initiated by "wordpad.exe" over uncommon destination ports.
  This might indicate potential process injection activity from a beacon or similar mechanisms.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify suspicious network connections that are initiated by `wordpad.exe`, a legitimate word processing application in Windows. It specifically looks for communication attempts made by `wordpad.exe` over uncommon destination ports outside of typical web and email protocols (such as ports 80, 443, and 587). The focus of this rule is on outbound connections that could indicate abnormal behavior, such as process injection or command and control activities, which are common tactics employed by adversaries to establish persistence in compromised environments. By monitoring such irregular activity, security teams can take timely action to investigate and mitigate potential threats. This rule corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of "**Defense Evasion**" (T1203) and "**Command and Control**" (T1071).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Analyze Network Connection Logs:** Review the network connection logs associated with the alert to determine the destination IP and port, evaluating whether it aligns with legitimate traffic patterns for your environment.
    
  - **Check Process Activity:** Utilize Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to assess the behavior of the `wordpad.exe` process. Investigate any anomalies such as unusual execution times or command-line arguments.
  - **Examine File and Registry Changes:** Inspect recent file modifications or registry changes that may correlate with the suspicious network activity. This can reveal additional areas of compromise or techniques being leveraged by the adversary.
  - **Review Endpoint Protection Alerts:** Check alerts from Antivirus (AV) or other security applications that may have flagged suspicious activities linked to `wordpad.exe`. This can provide insights into ongoing malicious behavior associated with this process.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity given that outbound connections from a common Windows process like `wordpad.exe` over atypical ports may indicate an active compromise. While not definitive proof of a malicious activity, such behavior warrants immediate investigation to mitigate potential risks.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire if `wordpad.exe` executes legitimate activities on uncommon ports that the organization uses or if the process has been masked via injection or renaming techniques. Additionally, the rule can be evaded by adversaries utilizing network tunneling or encrypted traffic to obscure connections. It is assumed that processes like `wordpad.exe` will not initiate legitimate traffic to uncommon ports; thus, false positives could occur in environments with non-standard configurations.

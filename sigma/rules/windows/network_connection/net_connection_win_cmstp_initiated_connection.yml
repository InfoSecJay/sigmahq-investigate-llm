  Detects a network connection initiated by Cmstp.EXE
  Its uncommon for "cmstp.exe" to initiate an outbound network connection. Investigate the source of such requests to determine if they are malicious.

  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule "Outbound Network Connection Initiated By Cmstp.EXE" identifies instances where the Windows utility `cmstp.exe` is making outbound network connections. This is significant because `cmstp.exe`, which is typically used for configuring and installing Connection Manager profiles, is not usually observed to initiate network traffic on its own. The rule leverages network connection logs to pinpoint such anomalies. Specifically, it inspects the process initiation logs to check if `cmstp.exe` is the image responsible for the connection while ensuring the destination addresses do not fall within the common private IP ranges, which might suggest legitimate internal traffic.
  This behavior is relevant to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the technique T1218.003, which deals with "Signed Binary Proxy Execution." An outbound network connection from `cmstp.exe` could indicate potential misuse for command-and-control communication, making this a noteworthy alert for security teams to investigate further.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) alerts for additional context or related suspicious activities involving `cmstp.exe`, such as the timing of the connection and command-line usage.
    
  - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Utilize network traffic analysis tools to examine the outbound connection details, including the destination IP and port, to assess whether they correlate with known bad actors or unusual patterns.
    
  - **Correlate with Logs:** Cross-reference the network connection event with Sysmon logs to view the process creation details, ensuring to note any unusual command-line arguments or parent processes associated with `cmstp.exe`.
    
  - **Engage in Threat Intelligence:** Look up the destination IPs in threat intelligence feeds to identify any malicious indicators related to the connections made by `cmstp.exe` or similar behaviors reported in the wild.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is marked as high severity due to the unexpected nature of a legitimate system utility initiating external network connections, which could indicate potential malicious activity or exploitation attempts.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  There are several blind spots with this rule. If `cmstp.exe` is invoked as part of a legitimate administrative task or from trusted internal sources, the rule may mistakenly flag these legitimate activities as threats, leading to potential false positives. Additionally, if an attacker uses methods to obfuscate their process (e.g., renaming `cmstp.exe` or using other tools in a similar manner), the rule may fail to capture those events. Therefore, analysts should consider context (e.g., user behavior and system states) when responding to alerts generated by this detection.

title: Network Connection Initiated By AddinUtil.EXE
id: 5205613d-2a63-4412-a895-3a2458b587b3
status: test
description: |
  Detects a network connection initiated by the Add-In deployment cache updating utility "AddInutil.exe".
  This could indicate a potential command and control communication as this tool doesn't usually initiate network activity.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is focused on identifying anomalous network connections initiated by the "AddInUtil.exe" process â€” a utility associated with the deployment of add-ins in Microsoft applications. Under normal operational conditions, AddInUtil.exe does not typically generate network activity. When it is observed to establish a network connection, this behavior could indicate potential command and control (C2) activity, possibly relating to adversary use of living-off-the-land binaries (LOLbins) for nefarious purposes. The rule specifically examines the network connection logs to see if the process name ends with "addinutil.exe" and if it has initiated a connection. This corresponds to the MITRE ATT&CK technique for "Living off the Land Binaries" (T1218), where adversaries leverage existing tools within the environment to evade detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Events:** Check the endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for any unusual or unauthorized access attempts by AddInUtil.exe around the time of the detected network connection.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Use the network traffic analytics from your NDR solution to identify the destination of the network connection and determine if it is related to previously known malicious IPs or domains.
  - **Examine System and Application Logs:** Investigate Windows Security, System, and Application event logs to correlate any associated process creation logs or unusual behaviors in other applications that might indicate a broader compromise.
  - **Look for Related Artifacts:** Gather information from the endpoint regarding any other suspicious files or registry keys that were modified around the same time to assess the full extent of the potential incident.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is assigned a high severity due to the potential for undetected command and control operations being established via a commonly used system utility, posing a significant security risk to the enterprise environment.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire in environments where AddInUtil.exe is not deployed or utilized, resulting in a blind spot. Additionally, sophisticated adversaries could potentially rename or obfuscate malicious binaries to evade detection. There is also an assumption that the Sysmon logging is properly configured to capture network connections in the Windows environment, as gaps in logging may prevent this rule from being effective.

  Detects network connections to BTunnels domains initiated by a process on the system.
  Attackers can abuse that feature to establish a reverse shell or persistence on a machine.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect network connections initiated by processes on Windows systems to domains associated with BTunnels, specifically those ending in `.btunnel.co.in`. BTunnels is a known tool that can be exploited by attackers to establish reverse shells and maintain persistence on compromised systems. When a process initiates a connection to these domains, it is likely indicative of malicious activity, as this behavior is not common for legitimate applications. The rule leverages network connection logs to identify when a connection meets the specified criteria, providing analysts with a flag for potential data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized remote access actions.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review EDR logs for the process initiating the network connection to verify whether it is a known application or a suspicious executable. 
  - Analyze process creation logs related to the identified process, including command-line parameters, to determine what actions were taken prior to the connection.
  - Inspect firewall logs for any other unusual outbound connections made by the same source process, which may indicate broader malicious behavior.
  - Search for proxy logs to uncover any previous interactions with BTunnels domains or other related suspicious domains accessed from the network.

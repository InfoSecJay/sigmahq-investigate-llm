  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies instances where the `winlogon.exe` process creates outbound network connections to public IP addresses. The rule looks for network connection logs where the `Image` field matches the executable name `winlogon.exe` and verifies that the connection was initiated. By filtering out private and local IP ranges, the rule is designed to pinpoint suspicious behavior that could indicate adversarial activity, such as attempts to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers. The relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics for this detection include Defense Evasion (T1562) and Command and Control (T1218.011). This rule serves as an essential component of monitoring the integrity of Windows processes and the network behaviors associated with them.
  The logs utilized for this detection primarily come from the Windows operating system, specifically through network connection monitoring. Investigators will focus on telemetry sources that provide visibility into process-to-network interactions, aiding in the identification of unauthorized or malicious activity correlating with the presence of `winlogon.exe`.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review EDR Alerts:** Check the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system for alerts related to `winlogon.exe`. Cross-reference with the timestamp of the network connection attempt for context.
  - **Analyze Network Logs:** Examine network connection logs for outbound communications initiated by `winlogon.exe` during the alert period. Take note of the destination IP addresses and the associated timestamps.
  - **Correlate with Process Logs:** Correlate the network activity with Windows process creation logs using Sysmon. Confirm whether any unusual parameters or execution chains are related to `winlogon.exe`.
  - **Check for Known Threat Indicators:** Search threat intelligence databases for any known malicious IP addresses or indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the observed outbound connection attempts.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential risk of abusive behavior involving a critical system process (`winlogon.exe`). Such behavior could denote an ongoing compromise or the initiation of unauthorized communications with external entities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several recognized limitations with this detection rule. First, it may not trigger if the outbound connection is to an IP address that is not within the filtered public ranges. Additionally, if adversaries use legitimate corporate IP addresses for their command-and-control activities, the rule may fail to capture such instances, leading to false negatives. It's essential for engineers to remain vigilant regarding changes in network infrastructure that may render these detections ineffective.

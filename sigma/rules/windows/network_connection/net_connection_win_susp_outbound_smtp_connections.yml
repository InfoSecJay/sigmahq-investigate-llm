title: Suspicious Outbound SMTP Connections
id: 9976fa64-2804-423c-8a5b-646ade840773
status: test
description: |
  Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.
  The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Outbound SMTP Connections" detection rule aims to identify potential data exfiltration activities through SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is a commonly utilized method for sending emails. The rule specifically looks for connections established from a Windows system to SMTP server ports (25, 587, 465, and 2525) initiated by processes that are not recognized email clients like Thunderbird or Outlook. By filtering out known legitimate outbound connections made by specific email applications and Microsoft Exchange Server processes, the rule seeks to highlight unusual behaviors that could indicate an adversary is attempting to exfiltrate data over SMTP without proper encryption or validation.
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically with the tactic of "Exfiltration" and the technique T1048.003, which emphasizes the risk of data being sent via alternative protocols. The identification of suspicious SMTP connections is crucial, as adversaries often employ such channels to avoid detection while transferring sensitive information.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Network Connections**: Use EDR tools to analyze network connections from the affected host, focusing on the destination IPs and the legitimacy of the connections made to the SMTP ports listed in the alert.
  - **Examine Process Tree**: Investigate the process tree on the host to identify the parent process related to the suspicious outbound connection. This can help establish whether the process initiated the connection legitimately.
  - **Check Email Logs**: Access and review email logs from any mail servers that may be processing the SMTP traffic to find any unexpected outgoing emails or messages that correlate with the suspicious connections.
  - **Assess User Activity**: Analyze user activity logs to determine if the user account associated with the suspicious connection has exhibited unusual behavior, such as accessing sensitive data or sending large volumes of email.
  ### Prioritization
  The medium severity level of this alert signifies that while a single instance may not be conclusively malicious, it warrants further investigation due to the potential risk of data exfiltration and the stealthy tactics employed by adversaries.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the adversary utilizes legitimate SMTP clients that are whitelisted or if they employ encryption methods that mask the outbound SMTP traffic. It assumes that the legitimate use of SMTP clients is sufficiently filtered to reduce false positives but may miss threats posed by bespoke or lesser-known tools that use SMTP for data exfiltration. Moreover, this rule predominantly focuses on Windows-based processes, meaning that similar activities occurring on non-Windows systems might go undetected.

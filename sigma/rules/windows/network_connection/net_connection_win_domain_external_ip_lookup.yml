  ### Technical Context
  The "Suspicious Network Connection to IP Lookup Service APIs" detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious activities within a Windows environment. It focuses on external IP address lookups made by non-browser processes targeting various IP lookup service APIs (e.g., api.ipify.org, checkip.amazonaws.com). This could indicate post-compromise activities where an attacker is attempting to establish a communication endpoint or gather information about the compromised system's external network identity.
  When triggered, this rule examines logs from Windows network connections to monitor requests sent to specific destination hostnames associated with IP lookup services. It filters out requests made by commonly used web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to reduce false positives from legitimate user behavior. This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1016 (System Information Discovery), which underscores detection efforts for unauthorized external communications that may signal ongoing malicious operations.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Examine Network Logs:** Review the network connection logs in your SIEM or EDR solution to identify the source process of the request to the IP lookup service API. Check if the associated process exhibits any other suspicious behaviors.
  - **Process Analysis:** Utilize the EDR to analyze the process that made the API call. Look for unusual command-line parameters, process parent-child relationships, or any recent changes in its execution that may suggest compromise.
  - **Cross-Reference with Threat Intelligence:** Use threat intelligence platforms to verify if the IP lookup service API domains are associated with known malicious activities. Determine if the same process has been flagged in historical incidents.
  - **Check for Compromise Indicators:** Search Windows Event Logs (e.g., Sysmon, Security) for other related indicators such as process creation and access, particularly focusing on anomalous behavior around the same timeframe of the detected network connection.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is categorized as medium due to the potential for malicious post-compromise activity. This is of significant concern as it could indicate an attacker is probing the network, but it also has a risk of false positives from legitimate network monitoring activities.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not fire if the malicious process uses a browser to conduct IP lookups, as the filters specifically exclude known browser executables. Additionally, if the compromised system has been configured to use custom or less common IP lookup services not included in the rule, those activities would not be captured. It's also important to note that legitimate applications might occasionally query these services for purposes like troubleshooting, which can lead to false positives.

  ### Technical Context
  The "Rundll32 Internet Connection" Sigma rule is designed to detect suspicious activities involving the Windows `rundll32.exe` process that connect to public IP addresses. Specifically, it identifies instances where `rundll32.exe` is initialized and attempts to communicate with external IPs, indicating the potential execution of malicious scripts or payloads via this often-abused Windows utility. The technical sources used for detection include network connection logs that will reveal the image name and the IP address being contacted. The detection logic excludes local and specific Microsoft address ranges to minimize false positives associated with legitimate operations, while also filtering out certain known benign command lines and sources associated with managed services.
  This rule aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Defense Evasion and Execution tactics, specifically the technique T1218.011 (Rundll32), where adversaries utilize the `rundll32.exe` process to execute malicious code.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Network Connections:** Review the network connection logs in your enterprise firewall or EDR for any outgoing connections from `rundll32.exe` to public IP addresses, paying close attention to the destination port used.
  - **Analyze Process Creation Logs:** Query the process creation logs to capture details about the parent process of any `rundll32.exe` instances to determine if they were initiated by a legitimate service or process, such as `svchost.exe`.
  - **Inspect Command-Line Arguments:** Evaluate the command-line arguments used to launch `rundll32.exe`. This can provide insight into the specific DLLs being called and help identify any anomalous or suspicious usage patterns.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference the detected public IP addresses against known threat intelligence databases to identify any potential associations with known malicious activity or infrastructure.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert carries a medium severity level due to the potential risks associated with the misuse of `rundll32.exe` for executing unwanted or malicious payloads. While not every occurrence may indicate a compromise, it warrants immediate investigation due to its possible implications for system integrity and data security.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in cases where `rundll32.exe` executes within corporate networks that utilize IP addresses falling within private or exempt ranges, thus assuming that such communications are benign. Additionally, if tampering occurs with the command-line parameters or if alternative execution methods are employed (e.g., through scripts running in PowerShell or indirect process invocation), the alert might not trigger. Furthermore, false positives may arise when legitimate corporate applications or updates utilize `rundll32.exe` for necessary tasks.

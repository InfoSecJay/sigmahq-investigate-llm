  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule monitors for suspicious network connections initiated by the Microsoft Sync Center application (`mobsync.exe`). It specifically looks for outbound connections to non-private IP addresses, which could indicate abnormal behavior, as this application is typically used for synchronizing offline files with network locations. By tracking the `network_connection` logs, the rule inspects the `Image` field to identify any instances where `mobsync.exe` establishes connections outside of designated private and reserved IP ranges. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1055 (Process Injection) and T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution), highlighting the potential for unauthorized data exfiltration or command and control communications masquerading under a legitimate process.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check Process Activity:** Use EDR tools to review the activity of `mobsync.exe` on the host where the alert was triggered and investigate any unusual command-line arguments or parent processes that could indicate malicious intent.
  - **Review Network Logs:** Analyze firewall or network connection logs for further details on the connections made by `mobsync.exe`, including destination IPs and the nature of the traffic to assess if it corresponds with legitimate business activities.
  - **Correlate with User Actions:** Cross-reference the timestamp of the alert with user activity logs to determine if the process was initiated as part of normal operations or if it appears suspiciously timed with other potentially malicious behaviors.
  - **Examine Security Events:** Check Windows Security logs for any associated security events that may have occurred around the same time, such as unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations that could indicate an intrusion.
  ### Prioritization
  The alert is given a medium severity level as suspicious outbound connections from a system application such as Sync Center could indicate an active threat attempting to exploit legitimate tools for malicious purposes, warranting further investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule may not trigger in situations where the `mobsync.exe` process is not executed as expected, such as when it is renamed or replaced by a malicious actor to avoid detection. Additionally, sophisticated attackers might utilize other processes or stealth techniques that bypass typical network monitoring configurations. It's also essential to understand that legitimate usage patterns may occasionally generate false positives, so context is vital for accurate analysis.

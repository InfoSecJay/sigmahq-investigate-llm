  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Suspicious Network Connection Binary No CommandLine" is designed to detect potentially malicious activities initiated by well-known Windows binaries (specifically `regsvr32.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `dllhost.exe`) that establish network connections without any accompanying command-line parameters. This behavior is often indicative of abuse of these legitimate binaries to bypass security measures, especially when adversaries attempt to load unauthorized code or communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server without revealing their intentions in the command-line context. The detection utilizes network connection logs, monitoring for instances where these binaries are responsible for outbound traffic but appear to operate without specific command lines, which can be a red flag for evasion tactics as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the technique labeled "Defense Evasion" (T1203).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Network Connection Logs:** Examine the network connection logs in your SIEM for instances of `regsvr32.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, or `dllhost.exe` that show initiated connections without a command-line entry. 
  - **Correlate with Process Creation Events:** Utilize EDR tools to correlate the time of the suspicious network activity with process creation events to check if these binaries were recently launched in a manner that appears unusual.
  - **Check Endpoint Activities:** Investigate recent activities on endpoints where these binaries were run to identify any unauthorized access or unusual behavior linked to user accounts.
  - **Analyze External Connections:** Use your firewall or proxy logs to analyze the destinations being contacted by these binaries. Look for connections to known malicious IPs or domains that may warrant further investigation.
  ### Prioritization
  Given that this rule targets well-known Windows binaries establishing network connections without command-line parameters, the alert is considered high severity. Such behavior is not typical and may indicate serious security threats involving unauthorized data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may fail to fire if the suspicious binaries use legitimate command-line parameters or if they are conducted in a manner that is obfuscated from standard logging mechanisms. Additionally, if the binaries are executed with a different method that doesn't log into network connections (for instance, if they are run from a different context or under a different user), alerts might not trigger. Furthermore, there could be benign scenarios where system maintenance tasks use these binaries legitimately without designated command lines, leading to potential false positives.

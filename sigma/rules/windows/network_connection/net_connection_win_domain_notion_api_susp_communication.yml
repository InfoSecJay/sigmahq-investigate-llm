  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "Potentially Suspicious Network Connection To Notion API" identifies instances of non-browser processes establishing connections to the Notion API (api.notion.com). In particular, the rule focuses on process network activity by filtering for specific executable images that do not belong to recognized browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, as well as the Notion application itself. By analyzing network connection logs, which capture details about the destination hostnames and involved process images, the rule aims to uncover potentially covert command and control (C2) communications that could indicate malicious behavior, such as the use of the exploit framework "OffensiveNotion." This detection directly maps to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of command and control (T1102).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Network Logs**: Utilize EDR tools or network monitoring solutions to examine the timeline and details of the connection attempts made to api.notion.com, looking for unusual patterns or frequency.
  - **Inspect Process Activity**: Analyze the associated process images for those connections in Sysmon logs to identify if any suspicious non-browser applications were running at the time of the connection.
  - **Correlate with User Activities**: Check application and user activity logs for context on whether the triggered process was expected within the user's workflow, ensuring that no unauthorized applications were being used.
  - **Examine External Communication**: Review outbound traffic logs from the NGFW or proxy to determine if there are any additional suspicious connections related to the flagged process that may indicate a coordinated malicious effort.
  ### Prioritization
  The low severity level for this alert arises from the potential for false positives, as legitimate applications can communicate with the Notion API. However, any unexpected or unusual non-browser communications should still be thoroughly investigated due to the implications of potential malicious C2 activity.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  There are several assumptions and blind spots related to this rule. For instance, the detection may not trigger if malicious processes are designed to masquerade as browser applications or if they obscure their network traffic. Additionally, legitimate applications configured to use the Notion API for integrations may generate alerts, leading to unnecessary investigations. Itâ€™s critical for engineers to understand how internal applications may interact with the Notion API to minimize false positive rates.

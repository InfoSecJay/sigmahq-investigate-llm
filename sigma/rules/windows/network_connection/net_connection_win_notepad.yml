title: Network Connection Initiated Via Notepad.EXE
id: e81528db-fc02-45e8-8e98-4e84aba1f10b
status: test
description: |
  Detects a network connection that is initiated by the "notepad.exe" process.
  This might be a sign of process injection from a beacon process or something similar.
  Notepad rarely initiates a network communication except when printing documents for example.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect unusual network connections initiated by the "notepad.exe" process in a Windows environment. The detection focuses on identifying instances where Notepad, an application typically used for text editing, initiates a network connection, which is atypical behavior indicating potential malicious activity, such as a process injection from a malware beacon. The rule leverages network connection logs to identify these anomalies. Specifically, the detection looks for any outbound connections from Notepad while excluding legitimate communication to common printer ports (like port 9100), where such behavior may occur during printing operations. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Command and Control (Tactic ID: T1071) and Execution (Tactic ID: T1055) techniques, indicating that malware may be attempting to communicate with an external server or co-opt a trusted process for its operation.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Notepad Process**: Check the process tree in your EDR to confirm that the instance of Notepad initiating the network connection is legitimate, assessing its parent process and any command-line arguments.
  - **Inspect Network Connections**: Utilize network logs (from the firewall or NDR) to analyze outbound traffic from Notepad, focusing on unusual destination IPs and ports beyond the standard printing functions.
  - **Cross-reference with AV/EDR**: Review alerts generated by antivirus or EDR systems to see if there are any associated detections for the Notepad process that could indicate malicious activity, such as known malware signatures.
  - **Review System and Application Logs**: Examine Windows event logs, specifically the Security and Application logs, for any entries related to unexpected process behavior or user activity that triggered the initiation of Notepad.
  ### Prioritization
  Alerts triggered by this rule are considered high severity due to the potential for active malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or unauthorized execution of commands via commonly used applications like Notepad. Organizations should prioritize investigations of these alerts to mitigate any possible ongoing compromise.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this rule effectively captures atypical usage of Notepad, it relies on the validity of network connection logs and may not detect all types of process injection methods if they utilize legitimate applications that do not generate a detectable network connection. Furthermore, legitimate printing functions could create false positives, particularly when network activity on port 9100 occurs. If an adversary is capable of controlling or disguising malicious activities within trusted processes, this rule may fail to fire or may be circumvented by operational security practices.

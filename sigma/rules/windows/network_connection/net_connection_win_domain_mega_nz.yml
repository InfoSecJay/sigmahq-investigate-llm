  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect network connections initiated from Windows-based systems to the domain "api.mega.co.nz" or "mega.nz." The detection logic focuses on network connection logs that indicate whether a binary process has established a connection to these specific Mega cloud storage domains, commonly associated with file sharing. Attackers have been observed utilizing cloud file-sharing services like Mega.nz to exfiltrate data or download malicious payloads. Given the nature of the traffic, this rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics focused on exfiltration (T1567.001), highlighting potential data leakage or command and control activities.
  The primary technical data sources involved in this rule are network connection logs, particularly entries that specify connection initiation. It tracks whether the connection was established by a binary process, providing insight into potentially unauthorized activity that could signify a breach or malicious behavior. Analysts should consider this context when investigating alerts and look for additional signs of compromise.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR for Associated Processes:** Investigate the process responsible for initiating the connection by querying the EDR for recent process creations and suspicious behavior related to the identified binary.
  - **Examine Network Traffic:** Utilize NDR and firewall logs to analyze network traffic patterns leading up to the alert, confirming the type of data being transmitted to the identified Mega.nz domains.
  - **Review User Activity:** Inspect user activity logs and recent commands in PowerShell or terminal sessions to discern if any legitimate actions preceded the connection to these domains.
  - **Validate Against Whitelist:** If the alert corresponds to known, approved Mega tools, reference the organizational whitelist to verify if the source host is listed as an exception.
  ### Prioritization
  The severity level for this alert is low, given that legitimate applications may use these domains for file transfers. However, investigation is essential to ensure that no unauthorized data exfiltration is occurring, as misuse of such services can lead to significant security incidents.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  This detection rule may not fire in environments where whitelisting effectively blocks these connections or where legitimate users frequently access Mega.nz for authorized purposes. Additionally, if attackers employ methods to disguise their traffic or utilize different mechanisms beyond direct network connections, the rule may fail to trigger. Analysts should remain cautious about false positives, particularly in environments where authorized uses of Mega.nz are prevalent.

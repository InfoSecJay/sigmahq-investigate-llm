  ### Technical Context
  The "Uncommon Outbound Kerberos Connection" detection rule is designed to identify suspicious outbound network traffic directed at the default Kerberos port (88) that may indicate lateral movement or potential privilege escalation attempts within a Windows environment. The rule focuses on identifying connections that are initiated by legitimate Windows processes, specifically `lsass.exe`, which is responsible for handling authentication requests. It also includes exceptions for other commonly used applications, such as web browsers (Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox) and Tomcat, to reduce false positives that may arise from benign activities. The detection leverages network connection logs to examine outbound traffic and aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with credential access and lateral movement, specifically T1558 and T1550.003.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify the Source Process:** Check the initiating process in the EDR logs to confirm it is `lsass.exe`, and investigate if there are any indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with this process.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Review logs from your network monitoring tools to look for unusual outbound connections from the affected host to external IP addresses over port 88.
  - **Inspect User Accounts:** Examine user account activity in the active directory to see if any unauthorized account is attempting to access resources that are typical for privileged users.
  - **Cross-Reference with Baseline:** Compare the outbound Kerberos activity against baseline network activity to determine if the event is truly uncommon and assess for any potential false positives.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert should be treated with medium severity as it indicates potentially suspicious behavior that could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. Prompt investigation is warranted to ascertain whether the activity is benign or malicious.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  While this detection rule is effective, it relies on consistent behavior patterns, which may not always be present, especially in environments with diverse application usage that mimics Kerberos connections (e.g., web browsers). Additionally, the rule may not fire if an adversary uses alternative forms of authentication or obfuscates the process involved (for example, through custom scripts or tools). Analysts should assume that certain legitimate applications might generate similar outbound connections, highlighting the need for an initial baseline to understand normal traffic patterns.

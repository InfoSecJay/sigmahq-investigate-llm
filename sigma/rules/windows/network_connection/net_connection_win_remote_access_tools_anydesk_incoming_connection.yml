title: Remote Access Tool - AnyDesk Incoming Connection
id: d58ba5c6-0ed7-4b9d-a433-6878379efda9
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects incoming connections to AnyDesk. This could indicate a potential remote attacker trying to connect to a listening instance of AnyDesk and use it as potential command and control channel.

  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule focuses on identifying incoming network connections to AnyDesk, a popular remote access tool that can be exploited by attackers to establish remote control over an endpoint. The rule works by analyzing network connection logs to find instances of AnyDesk being executed wherein the connection is initiated from an external source (as indicated by the "Initiated" field being set to 'false'). This typically points to potential unauthorized access attempts, where an attacker might be trying to leverage the remote desktop capabilities for malicious purposes. By monitoring the `network_connection` logs in Windows, the SOC can detect these suspicious activities and respond accordingly.
  This rule is aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the tactics of persistence and command-and-control (specifically T1219). It is crucial for SOC analysts to detect and investigate such anomalies rapidly to prevent potential data breaches or system compromises. 
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify AnyDesk Installation:** Check the endpoint for AnyDesk's presence via installed applications or directly on the file system to confirm that the software is legitimately installed and being used.
  - **Review Network Connection Logs:** Utilize enterprise network monitoring tools to trace the details of the incoming connection, including the source IP address and timestamps, to determine its legitimacy.
  - **Inspect User Activity:** Examine user activity logs through EDR or cloud services to understand if the user was performing any legitimate actions aligned with remote access functionalities at the time of detection.
  - **Conduct a Threat Analysis:** Use threat intelligence feeds to assess the source IP address against known malicious actors or related threat behaviors that can inform the severity of the incident.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is classified as medium severity as incoming connections to remote access tools like AnyDesk can be indicative of an attacker attempting to gain unauthorized control over an endpoint. Immediate investigation is essential to ascertain whether the connection is legitimate or part of a malicious action.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The rule may not fire in scenarios where:
  - AnyDesk is configured to run on unusual ports or is obfuscated, which would evade conventional detection methods.
  - Legitimate incoming connections from known and trusted external parties (e.g., IT support teams) may trigger false positives, leading to potential misclassification.
  - If the AnyDesk service is not installed or has been removed, or if firewalls are configured to block such connections, the detection will not activate.
  - Analysts should recognize that adversaries may disable detection logging or manipulate traffic to conceal their activities, which could hinder visibility into actual threats.

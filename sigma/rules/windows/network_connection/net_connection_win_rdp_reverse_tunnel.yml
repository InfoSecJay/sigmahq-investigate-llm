  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "RDP Over Reverse SSH Tunnel" is designed to identify illicit attempts to use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over a reverse SSH tunnel on Windows systems. In environments where attackers may attempt to compromise systems, this rule specifically looks for instances of the `svchost.exe` service hosting RDP (termsvcs) that are communicating over the loopback address (127.0.0.1 or ::1) on TCP port 3389. The rule leverages Windows network connection logs, particularly focusing on process initiation and established connections, to detect this suspicious behavior. 
  Violations of expected behavior are critical for incident response as they may indicate lateral movement (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1021.001) and command-and-control activities (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572). By monitoring these logs, analysts can effectively detect and respond to potential security incidents that exploit the RDP service to establish unauthorized access to systems.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check EDR Alerts:** Review alerts generated by the EDR solution for any suspicious activities associated with `svchost.exe`, prioritizing events that detail elevated privilege or unexpected network connections.
  - **Analyze Network Traffic:** Investigate network connections to TCP port 3389 originating from the localhost to determine if there are unexpected RDP sessions being established, using packet capture tools or network monitoring systems.
  - **Review Windows Event Logs:** Examine Windows Security, System, and Application logs for relevant event IDs that might indicate RDP service misuse, especially around the time the alert was triggered.
  - **Correlate with Threat Intelligence:** Verify any active connections against known malicious indicators or threat actors to further assess the risk and potential impact of the detected behavior.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as high severity due to its implications for potential unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network, posing a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of enterprise systems.
  ### Blind spots and Assumptions
  One significant area of concern is that this rule may not detect reverse SSH tunnels initiated by legitimate applications that also utilize `svchost.exe`. Furthermore, adversaries may use other ports or methods to obscure their activity, causing the rule to fail silently. The assumption is that when the rule fires, the environment is vulnerable to such lateral movements, but it cannot account for all possible methods of bypass. Analysts should remain vigilant for unconventional behaviors that might not be captured by this specific detection.

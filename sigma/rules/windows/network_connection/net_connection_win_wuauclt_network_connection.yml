title: Potentially Suspicious Wuauclt Network Connection
id: c649a6c7-cd8c-4a78-9c04-000fc76df954
status: test
description: |
  Detects the use of the Windows Update Client binary (wuauclt.exe) to proxy execute code and making network connections.
  One could easily make the DLL spawn a new process and inject to it to proxy the network connection and bypass this rule.

  ### Technical Context
  The Sigma rule "Potentially Suspicious Wuauclt Network Connection" detects suspicious behavior involving the Windows Update Client (wuauclt.exe) when it is used to proxy execute arbitrary code and establish network connections. The detection leverages key indicators in the command line parameters associated with the process. Specifically, it looks for the presence of "/RunHandlerComServer" in the command line, along with specific DLL paths likely indicating attempts to execute code via the Windows Update mechanism. This behavior could be indicative of an adversary attempting to bypass standard security measures through software that is generally trusted by the operating system. 
  To implement this rule, the relevant data sources include Windows Security Logs and Sysmon logs for command line details, as well as network connection logs that capture outbound traffic initiated by this process. The rule is linked to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly the defense evasion tactic (T1218), which relates to the use of trusted executables to conduct malicious activities while evading detection.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Check process details**: Use EDR tools to investigate the process execution details of `wuauclt.exe`, including its parent process, to understand the context in which it was initiated.
  - **Review command line arguments**: Examine the command-line parameters logged in Sysmon or Windows logs to see if they align with those flagged in the rule, focusing on the use of `/RunHandlerComServer` and any referenced DLLs.
  - **Inspect network connections**: Use your network traffic analysis tools to trace the network connections initiated by `wuauclt.exe`, particularly any external communications that deviate from expected Microsoft servers.
  - **Cross-reference with threat intelligence**: Conduct a search in threat intelligence databases for known indicators associated with `wuauclt.exe` misuse, including the specific command-line patterns identified in other incidents.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is categorized as medium severity due to the potential for a legitimate Windows process to be leveraged for malicious purposes, indicating a possible security breach that warrants immediate investigation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  Potential blind spots include legitimate use cases where `wuauclt.exe` is invoked without malicious intent, thus generating false positives. Additionally, the rule's effectiveness is reliant on the proper enrichment of command line data in logs. Adversaries with knowledge of this detection method might also employ obfuscation techniques or use alternate processes to evade detection (e.g., modifying their command line arguments or using a different executable to achieve similar outcomes).

title: Office Application Initiated Network Connection To Non-Local IP
id: 75e33ce3-ae32-4dcc-9aa8-a2a3029d6f84
status: test
description: |
  Detects an office application (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)  that initiate a network connection to a non-private IP addresses.
  This rule aims to detect traffic similar to one seen exploited in CVE-2021-42292.
  This rule will require an initial baseline and tuning that is specific to your organization.

falsepositives:
- You may have to tune certain domains out that Excel may call out to, such as microsoft
  or other business use case domains.
- Office documents commonly have templates that refer to external addresses, like
  "sharepoint.ourcompany.com" may have to be tuned.
- It is highly recommended to baseline your activity and tune out common business
  use cases.

  ### Technical Context
  This Sigma rule is designed to detect instances where Microsoft Office applications, such as Excel, Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint, initiate network connections to non-local IP addresses. It specifically targets behavior that resembles exploitation patterns identified in CVE-2021-42292, which could indicate unauthorized data exfiltration or command and control (C2) activities. The rule examines multiple parameters in network connection logs, specifically focusing on the process images of these Office applications while filtering out private IP ranges (e.g., localhost, intranet addresses) as well as known Microsoft and Exchange Online server IP ranges to hone in on potentially malicious activities. By capturing network connection attempts that fall outside these established safe boundaries, the rule supports the mitigation of external threat tactics associated with execution, particularly under the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Review Network Connections**: Use EDR tools to examine recent network connection logs for alerts triggered by the rule, specifically checking connections initiated by Office application processes.
  - **Analyze Process Activity**: Utilize Sysmon logs to trace the specific processes involved in the detected network connection, focusing on their creation and the legitimacy of their command-line parameters.
  - **Consult Threat Intelligence**: Cross-reference the non-local IP addresses accessed with threat intelligence feeds to determine if any are known malicious or a part of a larger botnet.
  - **Check User Sentiment and Context**: Interview the user associated with the alert to ascertain whether the activity aligns with their work context, and confirm whether the document opened or processed indeed requires external connectivity.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert has been assigned a medium severity level due to the potential risks associated with unauthorized data transmission originating from trusted applications. While instances may occur as a result of legitimate business use, they warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  This rule relies on the presence and proper functioning of network connection logging and the accuracy of IP filtering. It may not fire if the Office applications are executing through unexpected or non-standard paths, or if they are utilizing encryption that obscures the true destination IP. Additionally, if an organization commonly interacts with a wide range of external services, baselining and tuning will be critical to reduce false positives, as the presence of legitimate business cases might lead to neglect of the alerts.

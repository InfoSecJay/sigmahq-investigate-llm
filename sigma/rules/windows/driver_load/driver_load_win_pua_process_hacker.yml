  ### Technical Context
  The detection rule titled "PUA 
  - Process Hacker Driver Load" aims to identify the loading of the Process Hacker kernel driver (`kprocesshacker.sys`) within a Windows environment. Process Hacker is a powerful tool often used by both system administrators for legitimate purposes and malicious actors for process manipulation and privilege escalation. This rule looks for driver loads specifically related to Process Hacker, utilizing telemetry from the Windows driver load logs to identify activities that may indicate abuse of this utility. Furthermore, it checks for known identifiers such as specific IMPHASH values associated with this driver. This rule is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Privilege Escalation" (T1543), as unauthorized loading of this driver could potentially allow attackers to escalate privileges on compromised systems by manipulating processes and accessing sensitive data.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Driver Load**: Use EDR to check for any recent loads of `kprocesshacker.sys` on the affected endpoint, paying close attention to the timestamps and any associated process activities.
  - **Inspect Related Processes**: Analyze the parent and child processes associated with the driver load. Look for any suspicious or unexpected behavior that correlates with legitimate administrative tasks or indicates an unauthorized action.
  - **Review System and Security Logs**: Check Windows Security, System, and Application logs in conjunction with the driver load event for any indicators of compromise, such as unusual login patterns or execution of PowerShell scripts.
  - **Assess Network Behavior**: Utilize network detection tools to identify any unusual outbound connections that may coincide with the time of the driver load, especially those to known command and control servers or other suspicious destinations.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is rated as high severity because the loading of the Process Hacker driver indicates potential unauthorized manipulation of processes, which can lead to significant security risks such as privilege escalation and data exfiltration if exploited by an adversary.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  The effectiveness of this detection rule can be impacted by several factors. If Process Hacker is used legitimately by system administrators, it may create false positives. Moreover, adversaries may use tactics to obfuscate their activities, such as modifying driver images or using alternative tools designed to mimic Process Hacker without triggering this detection. Additionally, certain environments may not log driver activities consistently or may lack appropriate configurations in Sysmon or Windows Event Logs, potentially leading to missed detections. Analysts should also consider that users with sufficient privileges may disable logging or manipulate their environments to avoid detection.

  ### Technical Context
  The "WinDivert Driver Load" rule is designed to detect the loading of the WinDivert driver, which is often misused for activity such as capturing, sniffing, or modifying network traffic on Windows systems. This detection leverages telemetry data captured from driver load events, specifically looking for the presence of certain file names associated with the WinDivert driver (e.g., `WinDivert.sys`, `WinDivert64.sys`), as well as specific hash values that identify known variants of this driver. By monitoring the loading of these drivers, the rule aims to uncover potential misuse consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Collection (T1599.001) and Defense Evasion (T1557.001), where adversaries may employ tools like WinDivert to conduct malicious activities on a target system.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - **Verify Driver Load Events:** Check EDR logs to correlate the detected driver load events with authenticated user activity and process creation logs. Focus on any discrepancies that may indicate unauthorized usage.
  - **Review Process Origins:** Analyze the parent process of the driver load in Sysmon logs to determine whether it was initiated by a known legitimate process or a suspicious application.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Utilize network monitoring tools (NDR) to assess any unusual outbound traffic patterns that coincide with the driver loading, potentially indicating data exfiltration or malicious command-and-control activity.
  - **Cross-reference with Threat Intelligence:** Compare the detected hash values of the loaded drivers against threat intelligence feeds to ascertain if they are associated with known malicious campaigns or tools.
  ### Prioritization
  This alert is assigned a high severity due to the significant potential for misuse of the WinDivert driver, which can facilitate undetected activity and data exfiltration. Immediate investigation is essential to mitigate risks associated with network traffic manipulation.
  ### Blind Spots and Assumptions
  One recognized issue with this rule is the potential for legitimate applications to use the WinDivert driver, leading to false positives. Additionally, if the driver is loaded by a trusted process, the rule may not trigger an alert, possibly allowing an adversary to bypass detection mechanisms. It's crucial to refine alerts based on the context of your organizationâ€™s application landscape and user behavior to minimize noise.

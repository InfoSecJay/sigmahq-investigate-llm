  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule identifies potentially malicious network communication involving the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) when a user's email address is present in the request URI. IPFS is a decentralized storage network that has recently been exploited in phishing campaigns to host credential harvesting webpages. The rule employs a regex pattern to scrutinize the outbound traffic in proxy logs that shows requests to IPFS domains containing email addresses. When a suspicious request matches this pattern, it indicates a high likelihood of phishing activity, warranting further investigation.
  The primary data source utilized for this detection is proxy log data, specifically the `cs-uri` field, which captures the requested URL. By monitoring these outbound requests, security analysts can identify and respond to potential phishing threats that employ IPFS as a platform for malicious activities.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the proxy log entries associated with the detected IPFS requests to confirm if they exhibit patterns consistent with known phishing tactics.
  - Utilize EDR tools to analyze endpoint behavior around the time of the network communication to check for any processes associated with the detected IPFS activity.
  - Cross-reference user email addresses found in the proxy logs against known compromised email datasets to assess the potential for credential theft.
  - Conduct a search in your organizationâ€™s AV solution to determine if any flagged malware samples related to IPFS-based phishing activities are present on endpoints.

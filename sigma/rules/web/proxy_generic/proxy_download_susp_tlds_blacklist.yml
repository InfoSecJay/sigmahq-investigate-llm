  ### Technical Context
  This detection rule is designed to identify potentially malicious file downloads originating from hosts with suspicious top-level domains (TLDs). By monitoring proxy logs, the rule scans for specific file extensions commonly associated with malware or unwanted software, including `.exe`, `.vbs`, and `.zip`. It cross-references the URLs from which these files are downloaded against a curated list of known risky TLDs, such as `.gdn`, `.loan`, and numerous others identified by cybersecurity research. When a download matches both the extension criteria and the TLD blacklist, the rule triggers an alert, allowing security professionals to assess and respond to potential threats.
  The rule leverages logs from proxy servers to capture the necessary data, such as the client's IP and the requested URL. This comprehensive approach helps in detecting anomalies that could indicate attempts to exploit corporate assets through malicious downloads, thus enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
  ### Investigation Steps
  - Review the proxy logs for the ClientIP and the corresponding requesting URL to confirm the download activity.
  - Utilize EDR solutions to analyze the host system for any running processes or executed files that match the reported file extensions.
  - Check for any additional network activity surrounding the download, using NDR tools to identify any command and control (C2) behavior linked to the suspicious TLD.
  - Query antivirus and endpoint protection logs to determine if any threats were detected during or after the file download event, which may provide further insights into potential compromises.
